I just heard that [Artemis Software](http://www.artemiscorp.com) is distributing an out-of-the-box integration of Microsoft Content Management Server called [MCMS.RAPID](http://www.mcmsrapid.com) that is to be installed on top of MCMS 2002. The interesting thing is that, MCMS.RAPID is an open source project. Read the license [here](http://www.mcmsrapid.com/legal.htm). I was not able to find an announcement on Microsoft's website.  
  

The email announcement that I received made it seem like this was an Open Source CMS. But in reality it is just a set of customizations that provide a higher starting point for an MCMS development project. You still need to purchase the full MCMS product from Microsoft. I have heard criticism of MCMS for being very expensive to license. This set of extensions might reduce the total cost of ownership and make MCMS a more attractive option. Still, as I noted in another post, Microsoft does not seem to be paying much attention to this product so I would carefully consider purchasing it.
