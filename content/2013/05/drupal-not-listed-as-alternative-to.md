[Anthony Myers](http://www.cmswire.com/author/anthony-myers/) ([@xanthonysfx](http://www.twitter.com/xanthonysfx)) , from CMSWire, recently posted an article listing ["Five Alternatives to Wordpress."](http://www.cmswire.com/cms/customer-experience/5-alternatives-to-wordpress-019397.php) His list was really interesting. First, he openly left off [Drupal](http://drupal.org/), putting Plone there instead. I really like [Plone](http://plone.org/) but I would have to say that Drupal is a much closer analog to the core functionality of Wordpress. The projects even have an ongoing rivalry with each other as shown by Dries's April Fools post ["The Red Press of Drupal" where he announces that Wordpress is moving onto Drupal](http://buytaert.net/the-red-press-of-drupal).  

Second, the author didn't include blogging products like [Expression Engine](http://ellislab.com/expressionengine), [MovableType](http://www.movabletype.org/) (which, I hear, is improving), and [SquareSpace](http://www.squarespace.com/). The products that he listed ([Adobe Business Catalyst](http://www.businesscatalyst.com/), [Plone](http://plone.org/), [Typo](http://fdv.github.io/typo/) (I have a feeling Anthony meant [Typo3](http://typo3.org/), not this relatively obscure Rails blogging platform), [Umbraco](http://umbraco.com/), and [eZ Publish](http://ez.no/)) are all traditional, page-oriented (as opposed to post-oriented) platforms. This shows that Wordpress, at least in Anthony's eyes, has grown out of its blogging roots and readers would be considering it for traditional web content management. I would have to agree with Anthony on this.  

The third interesting thing about this article is that the various software communities didn't flood it with comments and other reactions. I would at least expect the very large Drupal community to dive in and lobby for their inclusion. Maybe the link-bait title of this post will change that. :)
