Last week I had the honor of being the first speaker to present at the first [Now What Conference](http://nowwhatconference.com/). My presentation was called "[Marketing Operations: How to get the bang from your bytes.](http://www.slideshare.net/sggottlieb/now-what2013-public)" The conference was an amazing experience. Here are a few reasons why.

  

  
 *   __The production values were amazing.__ [Karla Santi](https://twitter.com/karlasanti) and the rest of the Blend Creative Team obsessed over every detail from the stage lighting to the placards showing where to charge your laptop. I have never presented at such a professional conference.
  
 *   __The audience was totally locked in to every presentation.__ It may have been the topics, the format, or the fact that it was a one day conference. Maybe the awful weather scared away the folks who were just looking for a cubicle break. I am not sure how else to explain how engaged the audience was. The lobby outside of the theater was barren during the sessions. [Everyone at the conference was in their seats and taking notes](http://www.flickr.com/photos/blend-interactive/8663543270/in/set-72157633278810033).
  
 *   __The speakers were excellent__. There was a perfect balance of inspirational big ideas and practical advice. The speakers drew from years of experience and came prepared to deliver thoughtful presentations. The conference had one track and I felt like my experience as an audience member was better than I could achieve by making perfect selections at a multi-track conference. Kudos to [Deane Barker](https://twitter.com/gadgetopia) for the speaker roster.
  

  

Many thanks to Deane, Karla, and the rest of the [Blend Interactive](http://blendinteractive.com/) team for putting on such an excellent conference. The hard work really showed and I hope it was as rewarding for them as it was for us. Hopefully there will be many more.
