[Jake Dimare](http://jakedimare.com/), over at [The CMS Myth](http://www.cmsmyth.com), has [a great post that speaks to the frustration that agencies feel after turning over websites to the incapable hands of their clients.](http://www.cmsmyth.com/2013/04/so-you-say-you-want-a-content-management-system) Back in my agency days I used to call this phenomenon "Portfolio Rot." It was so bad that we used to take screen captures of new sites before they started to look like something you would see on [There I Fixed It.](http://failblog.cheezburger.com/thereifixedit)

  

As bad as portfolio rot is for agencies, it is even more embarrassing customers. The discomfort builds over time as the site degrades until it ultimately reaches a tipping point that triggers urgency and budget for an expensive overhaul project. Tragically, the only thing that the project does _not_ fix is the underlying problem: lack of operational capacity. At Lionbridge, we call the work of maintaining a site [Global Marketing Operations](http://www.globalmarketingops.com/). and I will be talking about all that goes into marketing operations at the upcoming [Now What Conference](http://nowwhatconference.com/). I hope to see you there!
