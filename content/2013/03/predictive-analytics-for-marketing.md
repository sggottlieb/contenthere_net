As a consumer, the article "[Predictive Analytics: The Power Behind Next-Gen Marketing](http://cmo.com/content/cmo-com/home/articles/2013/3/20/predictive_analytics.html)" &nbsp;sounds very encouraging. &nbsp;To date, most marketing technology has focused on increasing the capacity of marketing departments: more marketing emails, automated interactions ..., which leads to a marketing strategy of throwing more at the consumer and looking for response. &nbsp; Unfortunately, the most likely response a marketing organization is going to see is disengagement. After all, it is much easier to see an unsubscription than a conversion - particularly in a traditional business where details about purchase information are difficult to get.  
  
At first this is going to feel invasive. &nbsp;We hate the industry examples that the author presents (particularly credit scoring and health insurance); but I am hoping that predictive analytics will help marketers target their message to receptive customers who can genuinely benefit from the product or service. &nbsp;Maybe this science will even help companies discontinue programs that nobody would want.
