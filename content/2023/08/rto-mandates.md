Here is an interesting Fortune Magazine article about the backlash to Return to Office (RTO) mandates: "[We’re now finding out the damaging results of the mandated return to the office–and it’s worse than we thought](https://fortune.com/2023/08/01/research-damaging-results-mandated-return-to-office-worse-than-we-thought-rto-remote-work-careers-leadership-gleb-tsipursky/)". In addition to the inconvenience of getting to an office and the inflexibility of not being able to interlace small home tasks in your work day, this  article made me think of the “mandate” aspect. Edicts like these send the message that the employee is less valued for what they can achieve than for doing tasks in compliant ways. The top down nature shows how little power the management chain has to support the team and advocate for individuals.
