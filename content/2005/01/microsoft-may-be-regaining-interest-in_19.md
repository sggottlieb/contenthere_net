I just read on CMS Watch that Microsoft may be re-energizing their efforts behind MCMS. The news comes from a presentation made by Mark Harrison (see [blog entry](http://markharrison.co.uk/blog/2004/12/mcms-reloaded.htm) for slides) which indicates MCMS 2002 will coexist and integrate with SharePoint. The slides also reference the vibrant community of add-on providers including Artemis's Open Source MCMS.Rapid solution which creates a starter site that can be used to kickstart MCMS development. However, I would expect Microsoft to cannibalize any worthy innovation.
