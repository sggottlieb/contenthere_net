There is a good [article](http://www.econtentmag.com/Articles/ArticleReader.aspx?ArticleID=7620) on open source content management systems in the latest (January/February) issue of [EContent Magazine](http://www.econtentmag.com).  Here are some key points:  

*   Frank Gilbane, of the Gilbane Report, is quoted: "If you have a spectrum where you build a CMS yourself on one end and commercial solutions at the other end, open source can sit in the middle." I like this way of describing the role of open source CMS. I think too often the focus is that open source is cheap content management. The real potential of open source is that it provides commodity functionality that can serve as a foundation for building unique solutions.   
    
*   When considering an open source alternative, it is critical to evaluate the strength of the community. This is the engine that will drive the evolution of the software and also a resource to get help in using or extending the software.   
    
*   There is growing interest in open source CMS as more and organizations look at open source as an alternative or complement to commercial technologies.
