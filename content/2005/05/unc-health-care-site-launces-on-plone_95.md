There is an [article on News Forge](http://programming.newsforge.com/programming/05/05/04/218202.shtml?tid=48) about the [University of North Carolina School of Medicine](http://www.unchealthcare.org/) re-launching their internal and external websites in Plone.  UNC Healthcare had the classic problem of organically grown websites creating a disjointed and confusing experience for their visitors.  Operating on a modest budget, UNC Healthcare discovered Plone and was able to achieve a true content management solution at minimal cost.  In addition to typical content management benefits of distributed authoring with centralized control,  UNC Healthcare developed and deployed a "Find a Doctor" application on the Zope framework.
