The [Drupal Project](http://drupal.org) has reorganized its documentation into a new set of documentation handbooks.  Drupal's documentation is already pretty good thanks to a robust community using and contributing to the software.  The documentation team is now using a [Zoomerang](www.zoomerang.com) survey ([results](http://www.zoomerang.com/reports/public_report.zgi?ID=L22BAXDMCNN6)) and [Web Sort](http://websort.net), a web based card sorting tool, to leverage this community to make the documentation more usable.
