[The Gilbane Report](http://www.gilbane.com) recently [posted the results of their Survey on Enterprise blog, wiki, and RSS Use](http://gilbane.com/surveys.html). While the survey sample is not representative of a larger population of companies (the survey was voluntary and Gilbane readers are probably ahead of the curve), the results are interesting.  

Of the 58 respondents (mostly from companies under $25MM in annual revenues but 10 from companies of over $1 Billion in annual revenues.):  

*   Over 35 use Blog or Wiki technology  
    
*   More of the Blog/Wiki users use them for knowledge management and internal information dissemination, than customer communication.  
    
*   More than half of the respondents get support for their Blog or Wiki from their internal IT organization.
