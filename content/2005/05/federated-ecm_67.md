I just wrote an article for [Cutter IT Journal](http://www.cutter.com/itjournal/) about the decline of the "_one system to manage all_" vision of ECM and now I am seeing evidence of this trend wherever I look.  The May issue of [EContent Magazine](http://www.econtentmag.com) [reports](http://www.econtentmag.com/Articles/ArticleReader.aspx?ArticleID=7919) [FileNet's](http://www.filenet.com) new strategy of Federated Content Management.  In the words of Chris McLaughlin, Filenet's director of marketing  
>  ECM isn't about picking one platform and stuffing everything into that one platform . . . it is about choosing a platform you want to build forward from and giv\[ing\] your organization a range of options on how to move forward with a CM strategy.

FileNet is now emphasizing standards and interoperability that "creates a union of information across multiple content stores."   This is a refreshing departure from the one-size-fits-all rhetoric that lead to expensive projects that under-delivered and left customers hopelessly locked into their vendors.
