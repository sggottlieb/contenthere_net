James Robertson, of Step Two Designs, is doing some research for a study on Intranet Teams.  His study is focused on answering questions including  

*   Where in organizations are intranet teams located  
    
*   How big are intranet teams  
    
*   What skills do they have

  
James has an online survey to collect information (<http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.asp?u=48049868860>).      
I am looking forward to reading the results.
