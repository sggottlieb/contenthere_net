[CM Professionals](http://www.cmprofessionals.org) is holding its [second Summit](http://www.cmprofessionals.org/events/summit.html) ([press release](http://www.cmswire.com/cms/industry-news/cm-professionals-announces-second-semiannual-member-summit-000531.php)) in San Francisco on April 11th, 2005. I went to the first Summit in Boston (November, 2004) and it was a great opportunity to meet others who live and breathe content management, share our experiences and think together about solving content management problems.   

Like the Boston Summit, the Spring Summit is being held in conjunction with the [The Gilbane Conference on Content Management Technologies](http://www.gilbane.com/conferences/San_Francisco_05.html) ([my notes from the Boston Gilbane Conference](http://contenthere.blogspot.com/2004/12/keynote-themes-from-gilbane.html)) and Summit attendees receive a discount on their conference registration fees.   

See you there!
