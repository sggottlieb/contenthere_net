There is a new Plone Book available: [PloneLive 1.0](http://plonelive.com/) by Michel Pelletier and Munwar Shariff. What makes PloneLive really interesting is that it is a LiveBook that is constantly being updated. You can buy it print on demand for $44.95 from [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com) or a year's subscription for $29.95. The [PloneLive Site](http://plonelive.com) also has a blog and other content. The authors and [SourceBeat](http://www.sourcebeat.com/) (the publisher) make a good point that traditional publishing mechanisms may not be able to keep pace with rapidly changing open source projects and dynamic books are the best way to document. Unlike a project wiki, the authors are compensated for their content. It will be interesting to see if this publishing model takes hold.  

Unfortunately, the authors made a bad choice in selecting a sample chapter so it is difficult to tell if the book is any good. The sample chapter just superficially covers what a content management system is, what Python is, and how to install Plone.   

For an excellent book on Plone, check out [The Definitive Guide to Plone](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;tag=contenthere-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;path=tg/detail/-/1590593294/qid=1118684966/sr=8-1/ref=pd_csp_1?v=glance%26s=books%26n=507846) by Andy McKay. Almost the entire book is available on [SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/plone-docs) but I would not do without my paper copy.
