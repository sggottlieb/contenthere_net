My article on ECM for [Cutter IT Journal](http://www.cutter.com/itjournal/) just came out and is available [here](http://www.cutter.com/offers/contentmanagement.html). I am sorry to say that you have to register on the website to read it but there is a no email option if you are worried about the spam.  

The thesis of the article is that the ECM vision of having one centralized CMS to manage all kinds of content is dead - or at least misguided. Instead, companies are looking at ways to integrate best of breed CMS solutions into a more federated architecture that shares content. If you read it, I would love to hear your feedback: sgottlieb (at) optaros.com
