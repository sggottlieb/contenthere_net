The Zope Corporation recently [announced](http://mail.zope.org/pipermail/zope-announce/2005-June/001744.html) the creation of the Zope Foundation which is to be launched in October 2005. The Zope Foundation will be a non-profit that will oversee Zope community projects including Zope 2, Zope 3, and CMF. Copyrights of the Zope code will be transferred from Zope Corporation to the Zope Foundation. The Zope Foundation will also get a perpetual license to the Zope trademarks and take over management of [zope.org](http://www.zope.org).

Creating a foundation is a frequently used (remember, TYPO3 recently announced the [TYPO3 Association](http://association.typo3.org/)) and effective strategy for open source projects. Doing so makes the governance of the project more public and reduces the perception that contributions are benefiting a specific company. Other examples of this trend include Wyona moving the Lenya project over to the Apache Software Foundation, and Mambo moving out from under Miro International. In both cases, the project enjoyed increased attention and participation.
