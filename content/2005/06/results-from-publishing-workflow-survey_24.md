[The Content Wrangler](http://www.thecontentwrangler.com/)  has a [posted](http://www.thecontentwrangler.com/comments.php?id=P180_0_1_0) some very interesting results from a survey on workflow.  Some of the findings:  

*   Bottlenecks continue to be a problem in workflow and many respondents feel that better automation would improve matters  
    
*   The process is often hampered by people waiting on dependencies and then being rushed to complete their tasks.  
    
*   Finding and distributing the right version of an asset continues to be a problem. Particularly in environments that practice content reuse.  
    
*   On an unrelated note, many respondents never heard of some of the major CMS vendors. 26% never heard of Documentum.
