Optaros just released a new white paper that looks at how companies are using open source software.  The study is based on a survey of 512 U.S. companies and government organizations.   The report observes that companies are starting to use open source for more than infrastructure and browsers.  42% of respondents said they were using open source portals and/or content management systems somewhere within their organization.  16% were using open source in customer relationship management.
