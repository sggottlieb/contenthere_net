Maarten Manders writes a [nice analysis](http://www.sitepoint.com/blogs/2005/11/27/ez-components-%e2%80%93-new-competition-for-zend-php-framework/) of two application frameworks being developed for PHP: [eZ components](http://ez.no/company/news/ez_components_1_0_beta1) and [Zend PHP Framework](http://www.zend.com/collaboration/framework-overview.php). While there is still not enough visibility for a thorough technical comparison, the article does a good job of summarizing the need for a good framework, guessing at the direction of these frameworks, describing the buzz in the PHP community.  

One interesting point is that the eZ components framework has the same web templating framework used in [eZ publish](http://ez.no/products/ez_publish_cms) which is somewhat like the popular [Smarty](http://smarty.php.net/) templating engine. It sure would be great not to have to use a different templating syntax with every CMS.
