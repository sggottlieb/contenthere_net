[Plone4Artists](http://www.plone4artists.org/) and [New Zealand's "Government Web Guidelines compliant Content Management System"](http://www.cmswatch.com/Trends/585-Content-and-technology-standards-in-New-Zealand) are two examples of a group with specific needs putting together a "stack" of Plone technologies, with some customizations and making it available to a wider community. This is similar to the concept of ["Distros" in Linux](http://distrowatch.com/), which have been very effective in spreading the use of Linux. If this turns into a powerful trend, success will depend on the degree to which the Plone distros keep in sync with the core Plone community. Failure to do so may lead to fragmentation and compatibility issues.
