[CMS Watch](http://www.cmswatch.com) just announced the release of the 8th edition of the [CMS Report](http://www.cmswatch.com/CMS/Report/).  The CMS Report is widely regarded as the best, most unbiased research available on the Web CMS (WCM) software market.  In addition to reviews of 31 products, the CMS Report also has useful information on approaching a WCM project from software selection techniques to people/process issues.  This edition has expanded coverage of open source including a review of [OpenCMS](http://www.opencms.org) by [Janus Boye](http://www.janusboye.dk/index.en.htm) and a review of [Plone](http://www.plone.org) by yours truly.
