The Bricolage Team just [announced](http://www.bricolage.cc/news/announce/2005/08/19/bricolage-1.9.0/) the release of Bricolage version 1.9.0.  I have not yet test driven this release yet but the notes claim that this releases includes the ability to add related media directly within an element.  This feature answers a common complaint of Bricolage (and many other CMS) that a user must first upload all binary files and then associate them to an article.  There is also an improved  preview functionality where the preview page loads in a frame that allows you to work on a template and reload the results more easily.  Other new features include: a pluggable authentication system, improved LDAP support, a PHP template burner, and the option to use the HTML WYSIWYG editor [Xinha](http://xinha.python-hosting.com/) which is an active fork of the now dormant htmlArea3.
