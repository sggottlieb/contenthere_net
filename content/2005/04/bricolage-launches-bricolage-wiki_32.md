The [Bricolage project](http://www.bricoloage.cc) recently announced the launch of their community [Wiki](http://wiki.bricolage.cc). The presence of the Wiki will help spread the load of managing user and technical documentation for Bricolage. Currently, documentation is pretty thin and difficult to navigate so the mail list is the primary source of information on using and developing in Bricolage. If the community embraces the Wiki, it could be a very valuable resource.  

Right now, there is no content on the Wiki so the best bets for Bricolage documentation are the [How To Guides](http://www.bricolage.cc/docs/howtos/), the [API Docs](http://www.bricolage.cc/docs/current/api/) (which also have some user docs sprinkled in), this [overview article](http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2004/08/27/bricolage.html) on [Perl.org](http://www.perl.org), and, of course, the [mail archives.](http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=bricolage-general)  

If you use Bricolage and are looking for a way to contribute, helping populate the Wiki would be a great way to get started.
