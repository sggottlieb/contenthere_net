David Hobbs published a nice post describing [how to define a work program](http://hobbsontech.com/content/product-managing-your-cms-defining-work-program) for managing your website. The role of [website product manager](http://www.contenthere.net/2009/04/website-product-manager.html) is near and dear to me. In fact, in my [CMS Selection](http://www.contenthere.net/services/cms-selection) and [Content Management Assessment](http://www.contenthere.net/services/content-management-assessment) projects, I get concerned about long term success if the client has not designated and empowered a strong product manager and a established a disciplined product management process.  

What I like about David's process model is that it shows the components of the process and how competing requirements work through that process. The diagram is a nice visual for a product manager when receiving requirements and setting expectations.
