A couple of days ago I posted how ["going social" will be difficult for most companies](/2011/09/social-business-revolution-or.html). Then, what do you know, I get a real-life example. Just now, I saw this tweet from Bonnie Smalley, A.K.A. Bonniezilla, formerly the voice of "[Comcast Cares](https://twitter.com/#!/comcastcares)".

Last week she was saying:

  
>  "Dear Comcast: Thanks for dropping my prescription coverage. That was real nice of you."

If you don't remember Bonnie, she was the one who responded to you on Twitter when you were complaining about [Comcast](http://www.comcast.com) service. Now a guy named Bill Gerth has the job. Before Bonnie, there was Frank Eliason. Comcast Cares (whether it is Frank or Bonnie or Bill) cannot do much about any issues but it puts a human face on the company and probably defuses some frustration. The Comcast Cares crew seems genuinely concerned about the trouble you are experiencing. I think that Comcast was a pioneer in this area.  

I don't pretend to know the details of what is happening between Bonnie and her former employer. But I do know this: something happened to turn the former spokesperson into just another customer who sees Comcast as a lifeless corporate entity. The very opposite of what the Comcast Cares program is trying to achieve. 

Ironic isn't it
