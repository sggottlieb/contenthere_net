A few days ago, I was asked by a potential client to provide documentation on my CMS selection process. As readers of this blog know, I write [a __LOT__ of articles on the various aspects of selecting a content management system](http://www.contenthere.net/2006/10/selecting-a-cms.html). Probably the most concise descriptions are these two: "[Selecting a CMS](http://www.contenthere.net/2006/10/selecting-a-cms.html)" and "[How to Select a CMS](http://www.contenthere.net/2007/05/how-to-select-a-cms.html)." These posts go pretty deep and I have many other posts that go deeper into the specific activities. But, I still felt like I was missing a nice clean (less bloggy) overview. To solve that problem, I put together this [CMS Selection Checklist](http://www.scribd.com/doc/57210974/CMS-Selection-Checklist). The most fun part of writing the checklist was finding all the articles that I wrote over the years that discussed each element of the process. I also see areas where I can write more.

Enjoy!
