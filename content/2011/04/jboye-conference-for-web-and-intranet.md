A few weeks ago I had the pleasure of participating in a J.Boye expert group in New York. I love the open and honest format of the J.Boye events and am looking forward to the [J.Boye conference this May (3-5)](http://jboye.com/conferences/philadelphia11/). I am presenting on content management assessment ([Grading Your CMS Implentation](http://jboye.com/conferences/philadelphia11/program/speakers/seth-gottlieb/#presentation1)) in the web content management track. That track will also have a talk on HTML5 and case studies from The Nature Conservancy, The Smithsonian Institution, and University of Houston Libraries.   

I think this is going to be a great track for organizations that have laid down the first parts of the foundation and are looking to take their websites to the next level. Hopefully I will see you there.
