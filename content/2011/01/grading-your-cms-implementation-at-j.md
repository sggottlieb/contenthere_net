After taking a break from conferences in 2010, I am planning on doing more speaking in 2011. I am starting off my 2011 conference campaign with one of my favorite conferences: [J. Boye in Philadelphia](http://www.jboye.com/conferences/philadelphia11/). As I have mentioned [before](http://www.contenthere.net/2009/03/j-boye-philadelphia-2009.html), the J. Boye conferences are excellent. The sessions are informative and practitioner-oriented, but what really makes the conferences great is the social element. More than any other conference that I know of, the J. Boye team plans and promotes social activities that encourage attendees to get to know each other and exchange ideas.  

I will be presenting a session called [Grading your CMS implementation](http://www.jboye.com/conferences/philadelphia11/program/speakers/seth-gottlieb/#presentation1). There is greater potential to understand requirements in the months after a CMS rollout than leading up to and during the implementation. The only form of failure is not using that information to make corrections. However, most organizations label the selection/implementation project as either a qualified success or a total failure and suffer until the next CMS procurement (when they will repeat the cycle). They don't treat it as a milestone in a larger content initiative, which they should. My presentation will show how to create feedback loop to correct issues in three areas: [expectation rationality, platform suitability, and project execution](http://www.contenthere.net/2009/08/dimensions-of-success-or-ways-to-fail.html). Organizations preparing for a CMS initiative will learn how to set their project up for success and avoid common pitfalls.  

Hopefully, I will see you at J. Boye in Philadelphia this May (3rd-5th). If you don't catch my session, I am sure I will see you at one of the social events.
