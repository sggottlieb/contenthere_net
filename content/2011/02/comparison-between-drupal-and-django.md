This [article comparing Drupal to Django](http://birdhouse.org/blog/2009/11/11/drupal-or-django/) is pretty old but I just noticed it. There is a nice summary in the conclusion:

  
>  Drupal represents a middle ground between framework and CMS that we’ve chosen not to take. Drupal is far more capable than a CMS like WordPress, but also much less flexible than a pure framework. But more importantly, the facts that Drupal isn’t object-oriented, isn’t MVC/MTV, doesn’t have an ORM, and is generally less flexible than a pure framework, not to mention our preference for working in Python over PHP, all contribute to our decision not to use it.

I reached a similar conclusion on a recent project.
