If you live in the Boston area and you want to learn more about working with Plone, join the Boston Plone Users Group on Thursday, April 27th at 7:00PM. [Optaros](http://www.optaros.com) is hosting the meeting at our Boston office on Canal Street.   

This session will be a tutorial and discussion for applying a skin to Plone using the best practices and file system (rather than through the web) development. [Here are the details](http://plone.meetup.com/1/):  
>  Rob Baker - webmaster at Oxfam America (www.oxfamamerica.org) will demonstrate how to skin a Plone site including modifying the Plone CSS files, and do file system based development using DIYPloneStyle. The example skin he will be demonstrating is for the new bostonplone.org website. This will kick-off our group effort to build a community site for Plone enthusiasts in the Boston area.
