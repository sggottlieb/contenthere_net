TYPO3's much anticipated Version 4 was recently released.  In the words of project leader Kasper Skarhoj:  
>    
> Version 4.0 represents a milestone in the development of TYPO3 that we have been working toward for a long time. It supports qualitatively superior enterprise modules. The introduction of the the long awaited versioning feature is not to be forgotten. With the management framework for versioning that we call â€˜workspacesâ€™, versioning will be brought to the userâ€™s desktop. And that brings a transparency which even surpassed my own expectations.

Stay tuned for a review.  I am looking forward to giving it a test drive.
