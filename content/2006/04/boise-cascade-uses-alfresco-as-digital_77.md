From [InformationWeek](http://www.informationweek.com/management/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=184429461&amp;subSection=Best+Practices) via [Jeff Potts](http://ecmarchitect.com/archives/2006/04/14/676), [Boise Cascade](http://www.bc.com) recently announced their use of [Alfresco](http://www.alfresco.org) as a system to manage digitized images of invoices. The business problem was the need for recognizable images of invoices to support billing disputes. The system needed to be reliable, scalable enough to handle terabytes of data, and run on hardware that is cheaper than their mainframe's storage options. Using Alfresco, Boise Cascade was able to solve this targeted problem at a fraction of the cost of using Documentum.
