[Karim Lakhani](http://web.mit.edu/lakhani/www/) wrote an interesting [article](http://spoudaiospaizen.net/archives/2005/08/organizational-innovationthe-mozilla-corporation/) about the [Mozilla Corporation](http://www.mozilla.org/reorganization/), a wholly owned, "taxable," subsidiary of the [Mozilla Foundation](http://www.mozilla.org).  Karim is serving on the advisory committee to help Mozilla how to figure it all out.  The article describes how Mozilla Corporation has an opportunity to become a new kind of software company focused on "social responsibility, profitability and community purpose."  Of course, corporate buyers will focus on the price and quality of the product, but the social/community angle will help foster good will and contribution from the development community.  Who knows? Maybe the Mozilla Corporation will become the [Ben and Jerry's](http://www.benjerry.com/) of software.
