I was planning to update the look of this site as a surprise for my 100th post (not too far away).  However, I just couldn't bear the look of it anymore.  My colleague, Steve Zimmerman, a great designer but hesitant author (I am still working on him), volunteered his template because he couldn't stand my "brand" either.  
  
Let me know what you think.
