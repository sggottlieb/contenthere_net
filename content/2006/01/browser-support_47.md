Someone recently pointed out to me that my blog layout does not display correctly on MSIE6 and I am embarrassed to say that I didn't check the _other_ browsers when I applied the new style.  I should have because 29% of my last 100 visits have been by people using IE6.  In [Steve Zimmerman's](http://contenthere.blogspot.com/2006/01/new-look.html) defense, the problem is not really with the template.  The non-wrapping code samples in my "ZOracle" posts make the right column shift down to the bottom where it is safe.  The Gecko engine, used by Mozilla and Firefox, allows the code samples to run over the right column.  For now, I think I am going to leave it.  MSIE users will have to scroll down to the bottom for the navigation until the ZOracle posts fall out of scope.  Untill then, have I ever told you about a great little browser called [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.com/)?
