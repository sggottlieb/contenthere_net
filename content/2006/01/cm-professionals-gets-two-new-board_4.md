[CM Professionals](http://www.cmprofessionals.org) recently held elections to replace two outgoing members of the Board of Directors (Ann Rockley and Frank Gilbane). The two new board members are Scott Abel and Mary Laplante. Both Scott and Mary have a long history of contributing to CM Professionals and I am looking forward to working with them as board members. I also want to recognize Ann and Frank for their great leadership and dedictation to the organization.   

The CM Professional's management committee also got some new blood in this year's election. [Janus Boye](http://janusboye.dk/index.en.htm) is our new Director of Member Relations and [Mollye Barrett]() is the new Director of Communications. Welcome Janus and Mollye!
