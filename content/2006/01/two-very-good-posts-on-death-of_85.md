[Joe Lamantia](http://www.joelamantia.com/) recently posted two excellent articles on how "Enterprise Software" is losing touch with the real business problems and being displaced by more agile targeted technologies. You can read the posts [here](http://www.joelamantia.com/blog/archives/ideas/enterprise_soft.html) and [here](http://www.joelamantia.com/blog/archives/ideas/more_on_enterprise_software_is_dead.html). I could not have made these points better myself (although if you have been reading this blog for while, you know that I have tried).
