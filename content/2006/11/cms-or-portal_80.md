The whole reason why you started on this content management initiative is to get the right content to the right users at the right time.  A CMS is not the only software that promises to solve that problem.  In the good old days, many software buyers took an integration approach by presenting CMS managed content through a portal.  However, by building in some content management capabilities, portal applications are moving beyond just presenting content managed within a CMS, to replacing the CMS entirely.  At the same time, content management systems have beefing up their delivery capabilities and providing portal-like functionality that, in some cases, makes a portal unnecessary.    
  
So, do you need a CMS, a portal system, or do you still need both?  A few days ago, Bryant Shea and I [hosted](http://themalcontents.blogspot.com/2006/11/episode-3-portals-vs-cm.html) [Apoorv Durga](http://apoorv.info/) and [Janus Boye](http://janusboye.dk/home) to talk about that very topic.
