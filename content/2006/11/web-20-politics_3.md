My colleague, John Eckman, has an [excellent post](http://www.openparenthesis.org/2006/10/25/are-you-now-or-have-you-ever-been-a-member-of-web-20/) about a recent digital fracas on what it means to be a Web 2.0 company.  John summarizes a blogument between [Lawrence Lessig](http://www.lessig.org/blog/) and [Nick Carr](http://www.nicholasgcarr.com/).  While the discussion falls short of accusations of fascism, there is a considerable amount of comparison to Maoist philosophy.   Fun reading for those of us who appreciate a good intellectual dust-up.
