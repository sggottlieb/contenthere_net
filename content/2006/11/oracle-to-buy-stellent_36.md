I feel like one of my basketball pool teams just got eliminated.  [Oracle](http://www.oracle.com) just [announced](http://biz.yahoo.com/bizj/061102/1371279.html?.v=2) that it intends to buy [Stellent](http://www.stellent.com).  I [had them](http://contenthere.blogspot.com/2006/08/ibm-agrees-to-buy-filenet-for-16-bln.html) get scooped up by [HP](http://www.hp.com).  In addition to the disappointment of a failed prediction, I feel a sense of doom for Stellent's evolution in the field of usability.  If they are lucky, Oracle will leave the product alone.  Otherwise, content authors should get used to command line tools in much the same way all real Oracle database administrators still love their SQLPlus.
