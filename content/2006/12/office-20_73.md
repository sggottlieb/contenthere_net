Now that the web is about to move onto 3.0, it is about time for the office to get to 2.0.  Eric Severson has a [nice post](http://gilbane.com/ctoblog/archives/2006/11/xml_and_office_20.html) on the Gilbane blog about Office 2.0.  I will give you a hint, it has nothing to do with [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com).
