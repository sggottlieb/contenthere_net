Specialized search engines that focus on a subset of the web are becoming increasingly popular.  These services can reduce problems with ambiguous terms (such as the word "pool" that could reference a parlor game, something that you swim in, a group of persistent connections to a database...) by focusing on a subset of the web.  Google is enabling this specialization through its [Co-Op](http://google.com/coop) technology.  At least that is what Ric Shreves from [Mambo](http://www.mambo-foundation.org/) specialist [Water and Stone](http://waterandstone.com/) (they also work in [WordPress](http://wordpress.org), [Drupal](http://drupal.org) and [Joomla](http://joomla.org)!) is using it for.  Water and Stone has recently launched [CMS Search](http://cms-search.waterandstone.com), which indexes around 75 open source CMS project sites.   
  
This looks like an interesting tool.  There is a "refine" feature that limits search to a subset of sites.  Try using this to search for a feature and then drill down to see what the community or the documentation of a project has to say about that feature.   Unfortunately, this refining feature only works with projects that Water and Stone specializes in.
