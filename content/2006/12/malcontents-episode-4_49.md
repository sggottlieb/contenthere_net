We just posted [Episode 4](http://themalcontents.blogspot.com/2006/12/episode-4-boston-2006-conference-review.html) of the [Malcontents](http://themalcontents.blogspot.com) podcast.  In this issue, Bryant and I talked about the [Fall CM Professionals Summit](http://del.icio.us/tag/cmprosfall06summit) and the [Boston 2006 Gilbane Conference](http://gilbaneboston.com/06/).  Topics included Localization and Blogs and Wikis in a Knowledge Management context.
