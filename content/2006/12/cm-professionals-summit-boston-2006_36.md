I am back at work after attending the [2006 Fall CM Pros Summit](http://www.cmprofessionals.org/events/summit/us-2006-fall-cm-summit) and the Boston Gilbane Conference. I think that most would agree that the CM Pros Summit was the best ever (Gilbane was also very good but that is another post). We set a record for number of attendees. The speakers knew their stuff and the audiences were all very engaged. See some photos [here](http://flickr.com/photos/tags/cmprosfall06summit/). Adriaan Bloem, blogged everything he saw on the [CM Pros BeNeLux blog](http://cmprosbenelux.org/2006/11/27/cm-pros-fall-2006-summit-content-management-and-the-world-enterprise).  
  
I thought that my round table on [Levels of Localization](http://contenthere.blogspot.com/2006/11/levels-of-localization.html) went well. I am collecting materials for an area on the [CM Professionals website](http://www.cmprofessionals.org) (check out the new look) that describes the levels and shows some examples. I will announce here once something is up.
