The new member membership fee for [CM Professionals](http://www.cmprofessionals.org) is increasing from $50 to $100 on March 31st. While this represents a 100% increase, it is still rediculously cheap for all the value you get. For those of you who are unfamiliar with CM Professionals, it is membership organization for content management practitioners and experts. The community is free of corporate bias and it is an excellent resource for asking questions and networking. Most of the luminaries in the field that I know of are already members. [You should be too](http://www.cmprofessionals.org/membership/why_join/).  

If you have been considering joining. Now is the time.  

Sorry for the shameless plug. Now onto our regular programming.
