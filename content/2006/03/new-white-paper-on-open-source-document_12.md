My colleague, Sebastian Wohlrapp, and I just published a [new white paper](http://www.optaros.com/wp/wp_6_os_docManagement.shtml) on Open Source Document Management Systems. Last year, it seemed that most of what open source content management had to offer was in the WCM and personal publishing space. A lot has changed and there are now several viable DMS options. This paper focuses on basic document management functionality needed by the typical knowledge worker as an alternative to what most companies resort to today: shared file systems and email. There is great potential for open source to answer the need for open/affordable/simple solutions that deliver this functionality. Several projects are well on their way.   

  
The following projects were evaluated:  

*   [Alfresco](http://www.alfresco.org)  
    
*   [Contineo](http://contineo.sourceforge.net/index.html)  
    
*   [CPS (Collaborative Portal Server)](http://www.cps-project.org/)  
    
*   [KnowledgeTree](http://www.ktdms.com/)  
    
*   [Owl](http://owl.sourceforge.net/)  
    
*   [Plone](http://plone.org)  
    
*   [Open sTeam](http://www.open-steam.org/)  
    

  

We evaluated the projects along the following dimensions:  

*   Creating and storing content  
    
*   Organizing content and collaboration  
    
*   Search and accessing content  
    
*   Usability  
    

  

As usual, feedback is welcome.
