For those still regretting that you missed [Mitch Pirtle's Joomla! talk](http://contenthere.blogspot.com/2006/01/evening-with-joomlas-mitch-pirtle.html) at the January [BostonPHP Users Group](http://www.bostonphp.org), mark your calendars. BostonPHP [will host Mitch again](http://www.bostonphp.org/component/option,com_extcalendar/Itemid,33/extmode,view/extid,14/) on Monday, April 03, 2006 At 06:30 PM. In his last talk Mitch told the story of Joomla!s break from Mambo and gave an introduction to using Joomla! This talk is going to be more technical.   

I hope to see you [there!](http://www.optaros.com/company_contact.shtml)
