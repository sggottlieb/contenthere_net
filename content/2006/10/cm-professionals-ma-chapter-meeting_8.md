The CM Professionals [Massachusetts Chapter](http://www.cmprofessionals.org/organization/communities/massachusetts/) will be holding a meeting at [Molecular](http://www.molecular.com) at 7PM on Wednesday, October 25th.   

Here is the agenda:  

*   Chapter updates including the [CM Professionals Summit](http://www.cmprofessionals.org/events/summit/fall2006/). _\[BTW, I just got an update on the Summit at this morning's board meeting. This is going to be the biggest Summit in the history of the organization.\]_  
    
*   A round table discussion on selecting a CMS. _\[Bryant and I will be having a [Malcontents](http://themalcontents.blogspot.com/2006/10/episode-2-how-to-select-cms.html) podcast on the very same topic. Stay tuned. \]_  
    
*   A discussion of a new content management [Lifecycle Poster](http://www.cmprofessionals.org/resources/poster/). _\[For those of you just tuning in, there is a long history on this topic. Content management is a difficult concept to describe. Having a picture is tremendously helpful to express the many facets of managing content. Putting together the picture is hard because it forces consensus from many different perspectives\]_  
    

  

I am going to be there. Are you?
