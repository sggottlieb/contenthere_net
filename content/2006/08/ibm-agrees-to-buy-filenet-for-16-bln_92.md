And the mergers and acquisitions continue....  As analysts have been saying for months, infrastructure companies are buying up the content management pure plays and calling ECM infrastructure.  [IBM](http://www.ibm.com) recently announced that they are buying [FileNet](http://www.filenet.com).   That leaves [Vignette](http://www.vignette.com), [Stellent](http://www.stellent.com) and [Interwoven](http://www.interwoven.com), and [BroadVision](http://www.broadvision.com) for companies like [Sun](http://www.sun.com), [HP](http://www.hp.com), [RedHat](http://www.redhat.com), [Novell](http://www.novell.com), etc. to fight over. I don't know who is going to pair with who but if I had to guess...  

*   Sun buys Vignette  
    
*   Novell buys BroadVision  
    
*   Red Hat buys Alfresco  
    
*   HP buys Interwoven who buys Stellent  
    
*   Google makes them all irrelevant ;)
