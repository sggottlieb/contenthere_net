I don't know about being a wizard, but going with Blogger was somewhat intentional and calculated.  I had gotten up the initiative to start a blog and I didn't want an excuse of fiddling with technology to stand in the way of actually writing.  As you can probably tell, I didn't spend a lot of time on the name either.  Since making that choice, there were times when I was happy with the decision (like when my friend's self hosted blog was down half the time due to a broken fan in his server), and times when I wished for more than Blogger was able to give.  Having a cutting edge blog platform was never enough of a priority for me to invest in an alternative and migrating.  So I decided to wait for really nice to have features like categories.    

Well, the wait (at least for categories) is about to be over. I just noticed that new Blogger version currently in beta will support tagged categories. There are a bunch of other features that I don't really care about but categories are going to be great. Of course, it is going to take me a little while to upgrade - priorities and all ;)
