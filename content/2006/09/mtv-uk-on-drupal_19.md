Systems integrator and web design shop [Lullabot](http://www.lullabot.com) is redesigning and implementing the British MTV site [mtv.co.uk](http://mtv.co.uk) using [Drupal](http://drupal.org).  I find it interesting how Drupal, which has historically used as a digital community building tool ("Community Plumbing"), is turning into a real option for media companies.  On the one side, Drupal has demonstrated itself to be serious, reliable software capable of handling heavy traffic.  On the other, you have media companies shifting from a broadcast model to more bidirectional publishing where their readership actively interacts with and posts content.  Traditional media companies with established audiences are realizing the need to evolve the relationship with their audience to a more collaborative network or else risk losing attention to upstart Web 2.0 sites which have been so successful in growing virally.
