Late notice, but if you are looking for things to do in the Boston area tonight, the Boston PHP Users Group will host Siobh√°n O'Mahony's presentation on [Open Source Governance](http://php.meetup.com/29/events/5060224/).  Unfortunately, I will not be able to attend.  If you go, please blog your notes and post a link in comments.
