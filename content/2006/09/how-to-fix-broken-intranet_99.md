## How to fix a broken Intranet

  

__October 11, 2006 Toronto, Ontario  
__Prescient Digital Media, 180 Bloor Street West Suite 1102  
  

Organizations build an intranet to facilitate communication, encourage collaboration, and streamline processes. Unfortunately, too many of these internal sites have failed to achieve their business objectives and now require fixing. 

Social software â€” notably blogs, wikis and social bookmarking â€” offer powerful solutions for fixing a broken intranet. And open source content management solutions provide an ideal platform for supporting these applications, because they enable organizations to afford experimentation and reduce the innovation cycle.  

A 90 minute information packed session offered Free at 8:30 a.m. and 3:30 a.m. in Toronto, presented by Julian Mills, of [Prescient Digital Media](/), and Seth Gottlieb, of [Optaros](http://www.optaros.com/).
