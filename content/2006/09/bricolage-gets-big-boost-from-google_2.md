David Wheeler from the [Bricolage project](http://www.bricolage.cc) just [posted](http://www.justatheory.com/bricolage/soc_2006_results.html) the results from three [Google Summer of Code](http://code.google.com/summerofcode.html) projects. It looks like the program was a success for Bricolage. Three contributors were sponsored: Marshall Roch, Christian Muise, and Andrei Arsu. These developers added some AJAX slickness to the UI, improved the way content types are defined, and (drum roll) added [MySQL 5](http://www.mysql.com) support for Bricolage.   

I really like [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/). From a functionality perspective, it has always been well ahead of MySQL. I think that more people will consider PostgreSQL now that [EnterpriseDB](http://www.enterprisedb.com/) can give it commercial software style support and provide an easy migration path from [Oracle](www.oracle.com). However, lack of MySQL support was a constant nag on the mail lists and, for some, a barrier to adopting Bricolage. It is nice to see that that obstacle has been eliminated.
