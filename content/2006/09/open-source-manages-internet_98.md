[Matt Asay](http://asay.blogspot.com) just posted this [article](http://weblog.infoworld.com/openresource/archives/2006/09/open_source_man_1.html)  based on a [report](http://www.sitepoint.com/report2006/) by [SitePoint](http://www.sitepoint.com) and [Ektron](http://www.ektron.com) (thanks Martin BÃ¤hr for the heads up) about how open source software is starting to become the dominant way to manage content on the Internet.

Note: this is <span style="font-style:italic;">"managed"</span> not <span style="font-style:italic;">"served."</span>  The web server war was already one by the Apache web server.  I think these statistics say a couple of things:  

*   Open source content management software is out there and performing  
    
*   The demographics of the web are changing. Call it Web 2.0. Call it the long tail. Lots of individuals and small organizations are publishing like crazy and the tools they are choosing are open source. Small groups in large organizations are doing the same thing.
