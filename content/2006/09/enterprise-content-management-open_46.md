[ATI](http://www.ati4it.com) and [eZ systems](http://ez.no) are hosting an introduction to open source content management and [eZ publish](http://ez.no/products/ez_publish) on October 20th in the Washington DC area (Tysons Corner for you beltway folks).  [Here](http://www.ati4it.com/conference/index.html) are the details.  Earlier in the summer, I [presented](http://contenthere.blogspot.com/2006/05/will-i-see-you-in-dc.html) [(slides)](http://contenthere.blogspot.com/2006/07/my-washington-gilbane-slides.html) with one of ATI's clients: Page Glennie from the Department of the Navy.  Mr. Glennie had a great case study about how they consolidated a bunch of Navy acquisition web sites using eZ publish and saved a boat load of money.
