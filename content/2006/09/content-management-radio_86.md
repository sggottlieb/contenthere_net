Bryant Shea (from [Molecular](http://www.molecular.com)) and I have started to do a regular podcast in conjunction with [CM Professionals](http://www.cmprofessionals.org) on content management trends.  [Here](http://www.cmprofessionals.org/education/podcasts/malcontents/malcontents_9_18_06.mp3) is our first public episode.  This week we are joined by John Eckman ([Optaros](http://www.optaros.com)) and Riccardo La Rossa ([Molecular](http://www.molecular.com)) in a discussion of the implications of Web 2.0 to content management.  Comments are welcome.  And if you want to be a guest, let us know.
