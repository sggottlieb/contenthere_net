I just got around to registering for the [Plone Symposium](http://plone.org/events/regional/nola06) in New Orleans March 8-10.  It looks like an excellent program of [talks](http://plone.org/events/regional/nola06/talks) and [tutorials](http://plone.org/events/regional/nola06/tutorials).  Here are the sessions that I am thinking about attending.  

*   Best Practices: Plone Development  
    
*   Make Plone Go Fast  
    
*   Enterprise Search  
    
*   Introducing CMF 2.0  
    
*   Open Source in Construction: Digital Plan Room  
    
*   Mechanisms to Promote Free Market and Open Source Software Innovation  
    
*   CASE STUDY: Fundable.Org  
    
*   Applying Plone to Business  
    
*   CASE STUDY: Disney, An Intranet Success

  
With the low airfare and hotel prices, it is hard to think of a reason not to go.
