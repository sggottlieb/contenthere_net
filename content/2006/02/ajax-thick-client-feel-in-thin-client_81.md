Unfortunately, I missed Tuesday's [Boston PHP User Group](http://www.bostonphp.org/) meeting because it was an excellent one.  Our own Steve Zimmerman, along with Gabe Ricard from [iMaxWebSolutions.com](http://www.imaxwebsolutions.com/), Max Carlson from [OpenLazlo](http://www.openlazlo.org/), and Adam Peller from [IBM](http://www.ibm.com/) all talked about AJAX.  My colleague, Eric Shea, took notes and [posted them on his blog](http://www.eshea.net/2006/02/ajax-thick-client-feel-in-thin-client.html).
