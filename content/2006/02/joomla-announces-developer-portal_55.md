[The Joomla! project](http://www.joomla.org) just [announced](http://www.joomla.org/content/view/857/74/) the launch of their new [Developer Portal](http://dev.joomla.org/).  Joomla! already has the [Joomla! Forge site](http://forge.joomla.org/sf/sfmain/do/home) which is a SourceForge for Joomla! add-ons and a very well managed and helpful user forum.  The goal of the Developer Portal is to be a destination for the Joomla! community.  Content  includes the blogs of the core development team, the most recent forum posts, working group outlines, documentation, and IRC chats.
