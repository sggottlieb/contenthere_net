[Michael Sippey has a nice post](http://sippey.typepad.com/filtered/2006/02/dumbing_it_down.html) annotating Tom Coates' slides on the [future of web apps](http://www.plasticbag.org/archives/2006/02/my_future_of_web_apps_slides.shtml).  Sippey adds to the dialog started by Jeremy Zawodny in a [similar post](http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/006323.html) by describing why Coates' rules matter.  I think there are some good takeaways for the future of content in a Web 2.0 world.
