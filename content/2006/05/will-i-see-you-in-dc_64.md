I will be speaking at the [Washington DC, Gilbane Conference](http://lighthouseseminars.com/washingtondc/) in June (13-15th).  My [session](http://lighthouseseminars.com/washingtondc/SessionDescriptions.html#WCM4) will talk about Federal use of (you guessed it) open source content management technologies.  Joining me in the session will be Page Glennie from the Department of the Navy.  His group had a very successful experience implementing [eZ publish](http://ez.no).  Let me know if there is something you think that I should mention in my talk.
