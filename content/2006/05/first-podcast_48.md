I know I am late into the game but I am still trying to figure out the utility of podcasts. For me, the medium does not really work. I guess that is because  

<ol type="A"><li>I don't have an iPod<br/></li><li>I take <a href="http://www.mbta.com/">the T</a> to work and like to read during my commute<br/></li><li>My life has lots of interruptions.  So when I read, I just get in really small bits at a time - except when I am riding the T<br/></li></ol>

  

For those of you who can make better use of this medium than I can, Rahel Anne Bailie from [Intentional Design](http://www.intentionaldesign.ca) recorded [this semi-lucid commentary](http://www.intentionaldesign.ca/index.php/weblog/blogcentre/seth_gottlieb_demystifies_authoring_in_a_content_management_environment/) at the [Spring Gilbane Conference](http://lighthouseseminars.com/gilbane_sf_06/sf_06.html) in San Francisco.
