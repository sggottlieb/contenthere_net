[Here are the slides](http://contenthere.net/presentations/when_open_source_June_Gilbane.ppt) from my presentation at the [Washington Gilbane Conference on Content Technologies](http://lighthouseseminars.com/washingtondc/).  This was the first time Gilbane held a conference in DC and it was the first one to have an industry (in this case Federal Government) focus.  I was only able to stay one day but the sessions I attended were good.  The crowd was a little small but they seemed pretty engaged.  I wouldn't be surprised if this turns into an annual event.
