A reader sent me along this [really interesting post](http://blogs.msdn.com/ryanrogers/archive/2006/07/08/660423.aspx) on a Microsoft employee blog floating the idea of open sourcing Windows.  The comments are insightful with a little bit of zealotism thrown in here and there ("No real Free-Software developers would dare even look at it, in case they got tainted").  The general consensus (if there is one) seems to be that open sourcing older versions Windows would be useful to people still running those operating systems and getting little help from Microsoft or other software vendors who are not excited about supporting outdated versions.
