I just saw a post on the [Bricolage](http://www.bricolage.cc) developer list asking if anyone has any experience migrating from [Vignette](http://www.vignette.com) to [Bricolage](http://www.bricolage.cc). I don't know the context of this migration but I am definitely seeing a trend. Two of our current customers are hanging up their mid/upper tier WCM licenses in favor of simpler open source applications. We have one customer who is migrating from [Rhythmyx](http://www.percussion.com/) to [Plone](http://plone.org) and another customer who decided not to use their corporate standard of [FatWire](http://www.fatwire.com) for a new web property they are launching. They are using Bricolage. Interestingly, cost was not the primary factor. Both clients wanted to have something simple to use and and easy to extend.
