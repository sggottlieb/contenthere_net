My colleague [Ben Menoza](http://menoza.org/), just passed on [this article](http://drupal.org/node/73159) about [IBM Developer Works analysis](http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/ibm/library/i-osource1/index.html?ca=drs-) of open source and cheap software to build a community website.  They looked at [Drupal](http://drupal.org), [Ruby on Rails](http://www.rubyonrails.org/), [Mambo](http://www.mamboserver.com/), [Typo3](http://www.typo3.org/), [Movable Type](http://www.sixapart.com/movabletype), [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/), and [TextPattern](http://textpattern.com/).  Based on their requirements, Drupal came out ahead.  In particular, they recognized ease of installation, shallow user learning curve, user management, the community, and the flexible theme framework.
