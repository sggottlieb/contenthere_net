My wife and I just moved the family to the town we grew up in: [Northampton, Massachusetts](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=northampton,+ma&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;om=1&amp;ll=42.326062,-72.641602&amp;spn=3.342206,9.299927).   If you are in the area, let me know and we can get together.  I am looking forward to participating in user groups like I did back in Boston with [BostonPHP](http://www.bostonphp.org/) and [BostonPlone](http://plone.meetup.com/1/).  I am still working with [Optaros](http://www.optaros.com) so I plan to be in the Boston area for work with some frequency - it's less than 2 hours away.
