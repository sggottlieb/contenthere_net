Not long ago I was musing with a colleague that I thought that there should be a simple "[Joel Test](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/08/09/the-joel-test-12-steps-to-better-code/)" style benchmark for corporate cybersecurity teams. For those who are not familiar with the Joel Test, it is a list of 12 yes/no questions that all software development teams should answer "yes" to. My colleague said that cybersecurity is too specialized and domain-specific for a general list of requirements. Yes, I know that there are frameworks like NIST CSF and ISO/IEC 27001, but those are elaborate and complicated. Today I got the idea to ask Claude AI for a Joel-style test for cybersecurity and I think that it came up with a great list of baseline practices that all teams should comply with. Here it is. 

Looking at the Joel Test's principles, I can create a cyber security analog that captures the same spirit - simple yes/no questions that indicate fundamental health of a security program. Here's my "Cyber Security Team Test":

**The Cyber Security Team Test**

1. **Do you have comprehensive asset inventory?**
   Can you answer "what systems do we have and where are they?" in under 5 minutes? Without knowing what you're protecting, you can't protect it effectively.

2. **Do you monitor and log security events in real-time?**
   Are security logs being collected, analyzed, and alerting on suspicious activity 24/7? If an incident happens, you need to know about it immediately, not weeks later.

3. **Do you have an incident response plan that's actually practiced?**
   Not just a document in a drawer - does your team regularly drill incident response scenarios? When something bad happens, muscle memory saves critical time.

4. **Do you patch critical vulnerabilities within 72 hours?**
   Are you staying ahead of known exploits with a disciplined patching process? The window between disclosure and exploitation keeps shrinking.

5. **Do you require multi-factor authentication for all privileged access?**
   Are admin accounts and sensitive systems protected beyond just passwords? This is your last line of defense when credentials are compromised.

6. **Do you have automated security scanning integrated into development?**
   Are you catching vulnerabilities before they hit production? Security testing should be built into the pipeline, not bolted on afterward.

7. **Do you maintain an up-to-date threat model?**
   Do you know what attacks you're most likely to face and have you designed defenses accordingly? Generic security is weak security.

8. **Do you have network segmentation and access controls?**
   Can an attacker move laterally through your entire environment once they're in? Assume breach and limit blast radius.

9. **Do you perform regular security awareness training?**
   Are your users your strongest or weakest link? Human error remains the top attack vector - train accordingly.

10. **Do you have offline, tested backups?**
    Can you recover from ransomware or catastrophic failure? Your backup strategy is your ultimate safety net.

11. **Do you conduct regular penetration testing?**
    Are you validating your defenses against real-world attack techniques? Testing assumptions is crucial.

12. **Do you have security requirements integrated into procurement?**
    Are new tools and services evaluated for security impact before deployment? Security can't be an afterthought in vendor selection.

Like the Joel Test, this gives you a quick health check. A score of 12 is excellent, 10-11 is good, 8-9 needs improvement, and below 8 indicates serious gaps that need immediate attention.

The key insight from Joel's original test applies here too: these aren't the only factors that matter, but getting these fundamentals right creates a foundation for effective security operations. A team that scores well on these basics will be much better positioned to handle sophisticated threats than one that doesn't.
