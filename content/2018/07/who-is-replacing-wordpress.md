I have been working on an interesting data set about web content management system (WCMS) installs. From these data I am able to identify events when an organization rebuilds their website on a new WCMS. As anyone who has been involved with a web development project knows, a website re-platforming represents a lot of time, expense, and decision making. So these events are important market signals -- especially when you consider the platform they are leaving and how long ago it was deployed.  

  

I am starting to publish interesting observations on the Aberdeen Blog. [This first post lists which WCMSs most commonly replace WordPress](https://ww.aberdeen.com/techpro-essentials/what-replaces-wordpress/). I am doing similar analysis on other software categories such as eCommerce.
