__How could the RNC not select a CMS called [The Red Elephant](http://www.theredelephant.org/tre-cms/the-red-elephant-content-management-system.html)?__

[Gregor Rothfuss](http://greg.abstrakt.ch/) sent me a link to a [report about a ridiculous CMS RFP issued by the RNC](http://techpresident.com/blog-entry/rncs-tech-rfp-returns-nervous-laughter). As I have written before, [the traditional RFP process is totally broken](http://www.contenthere.net/2008/02/the-rfp-is-dead-long-live-the-rfp.html). Here, the RFP asks for innovation around sketchy buzzwords that are meant to be requirements yet still asks for a fixed bid. I wonder how the RNC could avoid selecting a [CMS called The Red Elephant](http://www.theredelephant.org/tre-cms/the-red-elephant-content-management-system.html)?

In my [Web Content Management Selection workshop at last year's Gilbane Conference](http://gilbaneboston.com/pre-conference_workshops.html#workshop-a), I told a story about a fictitious botched selection process for an imaginary website. This may be one of those cases where reality is better than fiction so I am thinking that the RNC RFP should be my anti-example when I teach the [selection workshop this summer](http://gilbanesf.com/workshops.html#workshopa).
