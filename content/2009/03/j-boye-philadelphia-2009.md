[The conference schedule for J. Boye Philadelphia 2009 (May 5th-7th)](http://www.jboye.com/conferences/philadelphia09/) is taking shape nicely. The J. Boye team has added several case studies to make it a true "user conference" just like the J. Boye conferences in Denmark that I have raved about in the past. Expert speakers include [David Pogue](http://www.jboye.com/conferences/philadelphia09/speakers/david_pogue), [Lou Rosenfeld](http://www.jboye.com/conferences/philadelphia09/speakers/lou_rosenfeld), [Lisa Welchman](http://www.jboye.com/conferences/philadelphia09/speakers/lisa_welchman), [Martin White](http://www.jboye.com/conferences/philadelphia09/speakers/martin_white), and [Tony Byrne](http://www.jboye.com/conferences/philadelphia09/speakers/tony_byrne). J. Boye takes great care to keep the tone of the conference un-salesy and encourage a candid exchange of information. To keep the conversation going after the sessions end each day, there are also three social events: the Conference Dinner (May 5th), the Conference Party (May 6th) and the Farewell Dinner (May 7th). If you are coming in from overseas you also might want to attend the "Jetlag Reception" on Monday May 4th.
