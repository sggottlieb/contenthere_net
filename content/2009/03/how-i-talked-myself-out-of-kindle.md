It takes me a really long time to buy a gadget. Over the course of months I deliberate whether I really need the device and, if I do, what options I should get. The current object of my rumination is the [Amazon Kindle 2](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00154JDAI?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=contenthere-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00154JDAI)

 and, right now, the pendulum is on the "not buy" side of the swing. Here are the arguments that are keeping it there.

A Kindle would be powered by a coal plant on the other side of town.<br/></li><li><strong>I would rather read than talk about my reading device.</strong> I have hardly ever seen anyone actually reading a Kindle. Most Kindle owners that I see are too busy getting interrupted by strangers who have an opinion about the future of eBooks. A shy person like myself appreciates the camouflaging qualities of a nice boring looking paper book.<br/></li>

 and put a little money in my Kindle fund (because that I know that I will eventually cave).
