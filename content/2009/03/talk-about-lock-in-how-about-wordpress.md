[Lorelle VanFossen posted the first known permanent WordPress tattoo.](http://lorelle.wordpress.com/2009/02/09/first-ever-permanent-wordpress-tattoo/) I guess (tattoo recipient) [Ed Morita](http://www.bakershours.com/) didn't read my post on [CMS exit strategies](http://www.contenthere.net/2004/12/cms-exit-strategies.html). As with most CMS implementations, the feedback has been mixed. Comments on Lorelle's blog range from "Woah! I think itâ€™s a good tat! And it is a great location" to "Oh dear I hope that is fake cos that is the lamest tattoo ever!" However, unlike most CMS implementations, which are planned to be in place for less than 5 years, Ed's tattoo should last a lifetime.
