Nadav Schreibman just commented on my post ["Is Drupal the right platform for whitehouse.gov?"](http://www.contenthere.net/2009/10/is-drupal-the-right-platform-for-whitehouse-gov.html) to say that [Recovery.gov is now running on Sharepoint.](http://ohmygov.com/blogs/general_news/archive/2009/10/23/Recovery-gov-revamped-with-an-unexpected-helper-SharePoint.aspx) I was pretty shocked when I read the article and had to check the source on the site. Sure enough, I am seeing Sharepoint HTML in all of its postback glory.  

The referenced article from [Oh My Gov](http://ohmygov.com) talks about how the Recovery.gov needed a more portal-like framework. Both [Drupal](http://drupal.org) and [Sharepoint](http://sharepoint.microsoft.com/Pages/Default.aspx) can be described as development frameworks. Drupal leans more towards being a CMS product (with strong capabilities for developing content) while Sharepoint is more of a portal (with strong capabilities for pulling content and data from other sources). It seems like Recovery.gov, with it's mandate to expose where recovery money is being spent, needed more portal and less CMS. This was an expensive change â€” the redesign project cost $18 Million, which may not be a lot of money in government spending terms but is more than most of my clients have lying around. Thanks Nadav for the tip!
