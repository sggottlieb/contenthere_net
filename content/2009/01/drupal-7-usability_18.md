[The Drupal 7 Usability Team is doing usability tests at the University of Baltimore](http://www.bojhan.nl/usability-testing-at-university-of-baltimore/).  Drupal is one of the few open source content management projects that does formal usability testing and [is so public about the results](http://boston2008.drupalcon.org/session/report-formal-usability-testing-university-minnesota-libraries).  [Here is a nice short vlog showing Dries' reaction to usability testing done last year on Drupal 6 at the University of Minnesota](http://buytaert.net/first-results-from-usability-testing). It shows how he took in the information, his surprise, and how he resolved to make adjustments. Also nice heatmap diagram of where the users looked.
