If you have stumbled on a best practice in content management, here is your chance to tell the world about it.  [Erik Hartman](http://www.hartman-communicatie.nl/?page_id=8) and [Bob Boiko](http://www.metatorial.com/) are publishing a series called [Information Management - Global Best Practices International Edition](http://www.informationmanagementframework.org/).  The first edition will be published in October of this year.  They are looking for best practices in a long list of areas.  Articles are expected to be 4,000 to 6,000 words.
