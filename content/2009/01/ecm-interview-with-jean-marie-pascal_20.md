Jean Marie Pascal, from [Going to an OpenSource ECM World](http://www.open-source-ecm.com/) recently [interviewed me about my thoughts on ECM and Open Source](http://www.open-source-ecm.com/2009/01/interview-seth-gottlieb-founder-and.html). JM has also done interviews with [Jeff Potts from Optaros](http://www.open-source-ecm.com/2009/01/interview-jeff-potts-experienced-ecm.html), [Eric Barroca from Nuxeo](http://www.open-source-ecm.com/2008/10/interview-eric-barroca-executive-vp.html), and  [Nancy Garrity from Alfresco](http://www.open-source-ecm.com/2008/10/interview-nancy-garrity-alfresco.html).  All of the interviews are rich with information about ECM and the unique perspectives of each of these individuals.  Great idea Jean Marie!
