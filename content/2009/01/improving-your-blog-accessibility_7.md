Todd O'Neill, over at [DoingMedia](http://www.doingmedia.net/) has started to embed automatically generated audio versions of his blog posts to make his content more accessible to the visually impaired (and to sighted people whose eyes are busy doing something other than reading - like watching where they are driving/running/walking).  He is using a service called [Odiogo](http://www.odiogo.com/) that takes in an RSS feed, does the audio production, and gives you a play button to embed in your blog template.  The audio channel of your feed can also be published to iTunes.  [Here is how Odiogo works.](http://www.odiogo.com/bloggers.php)  Best of all the service is free.  The plan is to include advertisements in the audio that pay for the service and may lead to a revenue share among participating bloggers.  
  
Cool stuff Todd!
