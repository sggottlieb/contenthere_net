One of my favorite personal software applications is [Things by Cultured Code](http://culturedcode.com/things/).  I wrote about Things a while ago in [a long post of Mac applications that I like](http://www.contenthere.net/2008/06/i-use-this.html).  Since that time I have increased my usage of Things.  It is now everything from a to do list to a personal issue tracker for projects that I work alone on.  Being able to quickly jot down a task saves you from breaking the flow of what you are currently working on.  The iPhone application is there to receive tasks when I am not near a computer.  The two applications synchronize whenever they see each other on a WiFi network.  
  
The Cultured Code Team has just released version 1.0 of Things.  The beta releases have been free but now it costs $50 ($49.95 to be precise). If you are also hooked on Things, you can use the coupon code "THINGSPRESALE20" to get 20% off the list price.
