[The Plone Foundation](http://plone.org/foundation), the non-profit that owns the Plone copyright and manages the [Plone project](http://plone.org), [has initiated a program where Plone consultancies can sponsor the Plone project](http://plone.org/foundation/newsitems/plone-foundation-launches-sponsorship-program-for-plone-consulting-firms).   In return for a $500 sponsorship fee, a sponsor will get its company logo placed on the [Plone.net](http://plone.net) site (Plone.net is targeted at business people evaluating and using Plone) and the ability to place a Plone sponsor badge on its site.  Premium sponsors will be placed on the top of the plone.net search results.  
  
I think this is a good move for the Plone Foundation.  It accomplishes the goals of helping Plone consultancies become more visible and it provides funding for all the great work that the Plone Foundation does.  The $500 sponsorship fee is modest enough for individual practitioners to handle - especially considering all the benefit they get from being part of the Plone community.
