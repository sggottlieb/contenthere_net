If you recently clicked through to [Content Here](http://www.contenthere.net), you may have noticed that some changes are afoot. Most obvious is that I have retired my old site theme. The old theme has served me well (starting on Blogger and now on WordPress) but it is time to move on. Special thanks to [Leslie Charles from LAC Design](http://www.lacdesign.com/) for her help with the design. Less obvious is migration onto a different web host with hopes of some improved performance. I perceived a small improvement. Please let me know what you think.

  

But even bigger news is coming soon: in the very near future I will be announcing a new report series. __So stay tuned!__
