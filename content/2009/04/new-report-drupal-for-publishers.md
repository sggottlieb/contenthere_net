Florence, MA (April 21, 2009) -- Content Here is pleased to announce the availability of a new report. _Drupal for Publishers_, is the first of a new report series called _Web Technologies for Publishers_. Written for a cross-functional technology selection committee, each report evaluates a technology against the specific requirements of a newspaper, magazine, or broadcast news website. All Content Here reports are written with the customer in mind â€” distilling a wealth of information from a wide range of sources into a concise, easy to read narrative. Drupal for Publishers has case studies describing [Drupal](http://drupal.org/) implementations at Fast Company, Lifetime TV, Morris Publishing, Now Public, and The Onion. 

  

The 24 page report is broken down into sections that explain what the different stakeholders (the publisher, the editor, and the developer) need to know about Drupal. The publisher's section contains information about the time to market, availability of talent, cost, and the future of Drupal. the editor's section covers functional aspects such as content entry, workflow, editorial control and general usability. The developer's section discusses extensibility, security, performance, and developer resources.

  

Drupal for Publishers is priced at $100 for a workgroup license and can be purchased from the Content Here reports store.
