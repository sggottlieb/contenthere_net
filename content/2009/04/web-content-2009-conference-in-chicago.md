The [Web Content Conference in Chicago (June 15-16)](http://www.webcontentconferences.com/chicago/2009) is running a special promotion of [$100 off the regular registration price](https://www.gifttool.com/registrar/ShowEventDetails?ID=1208&amp;EID=4681).  I have spoken at this conference twice and consider it a _hidden gem_ in the content management conference scene.  The atmosphere is non-commercial and down to earth, the [speakers](http://www.webcontentconferences.com/chicago/2009/presenters/) are exceptional, and the audience is knowledgeable and engaged.  If you can get to Chicago this summer and you want to learn about ways to leverage web content, attending this conference is an obvious choice.
