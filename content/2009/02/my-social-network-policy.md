__Note: this policy is now being managed on my __[__personal site__](http://www.sethgottlieb.com "Seth Gottlieb")__. &nbsp;Please get the latest version __[__here__](http://www.sethgottlieb.com/friend_policy "Seth Gottlieb Friend Policy")__. &nbsp;__  
  
Over the past few years I have joined several social networking sites and continue to use a few of them regularly.  These sites serve different purposes for me and I have started to come up with strategies of whom to connect with where.  Here are the general guidelines that I have developed (subject to spontaneous change and arbitrary override).  

  
 2.   On [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com), I only "friend" real life friends and family.
  
 4.   On location based services (like [Tripit](http://www.tripit.com), [Brightkite](http://www.brightkite.com)), I only connect to people that I would genuinely like to meet up with when traveling and who I trust not to rob my house when I am away.
  
 6.   On [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com), I only connect with people that I would want to work with.
  
 8.   I only follow people who inform and/or entertain me on [Twitter](htt://twitter.com) and [Friendfeed](http://friendfeed.com)
  
 10.   I have stopped joining sites like Naymz for which I can't see real purpose.
  

  
Well, those are my rules and I'm stickin' to 'em... at least, for now and when I don't forget them (LOLZ).
