Karl Horak, A.K.A. Schlepp, has started an initiative that he calls the [Great Backyard Plone Count - GBPC](http://plonemetrics.blogspot.com/2009/02/great-backyard-plone-count.html).  Modeled after the [Audubon Society's Great Backyard Bird Count](http://www.birdsource.org/gbbc/), the GBPC attempts to survey Plone sites _in the wild_.  The general idea is that everyone in the Plone Community spends time each day during the sample period looking for sites running Plone.  I am a little to late to this as the dates for the count are February 13-16, 2009 so you will have to participate next year.  One thing that I think could improve the GBPC support materials is a listing of what to look for when trying to identify a Plone site.  
  
As a web content management consultant, I have a keen interest in knowing the CMS behind the site.  In fact, I have a hard time visiting a site without trying to guess.  Over the years, I have developed an awareness of the various ["tells"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tell_(poker)) associated with the different CMS platforms.  I also like to keep a list of known sightings such as when [Dries Buytaert posts announcements of new Drupal sitest](http://buytaert.net/tag/drupal-sites).  I got all excited when [Deane Barker](http://gadgetopia.com/) told me about the [Backend Info Plugin for Firefox](http://www.backendinfo.com/) which is supposed to figure out what is running the site you are on.  What a letdown when I learned how few technologies it knows about!  It didn't even catch obvious tells like the [commas in the URLs](http://www.people.com/people/0,,,00.html) of old [Vignette](http://www.vignette.com/) Story Server sites or the word ["Satellite" that appears in the URLs](http://www.realmadrid.com/cs/Satellite/en/Home) of so many [FatWire](http://www.fatwire.com) sites.  It didn't even catch sites with "generator" meta tags.  
  
Since reading about the GBPC, I never realized how much like bird watching my "hobby" of CMS identification is (only probably less cool).  Does anyone else have this crazy hobby?  
  
__\[Edit\] __[The results are in](http://plonemetrics.blogspot.com/2009/02/gbpc-is-ovah.html "GBPC Results"). &nbsp;People submitted 183 sites over the 96 hour collection period. &nbsp;It looks like around 40 people participated. &nbsp;Pretty good for a first go around. &nbsp;I would expect with some more publicity, this could initiative could return much more results. &nbsp;Karl did a sweep of Delicious links and found 2,326 tag with plone-site. &nbsp;Of course, the thing that this method has over Delicious is that it gets to the internal sites running Plone.
