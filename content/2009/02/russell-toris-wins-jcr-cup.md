[via CMSWire](http://www.cmswire.com/cms/events/day-software-awards-first-jcr-cup-winner-003854.php), [Day Software](http://www.day.com) recently announced the winner of the JCR 2008 Cup. [Russell Toris won the MacBook Pro grand prize for his web clipping application "Crux"](http://www.day.com/content/day/en/company/news_events/press_releases/day_jcr_cup_2008_winner.html).  While the idea is not all that innovative (it appears to be very similar to [delicious.com](http://delicious.com/)), the application shows how easy it is to get started developing on the [CRX/Apache Sling bundle](http://dev.day.com/microsling/content/blogs/cup.c.html).  Russell is a self proclaimed novice programmer with skills mainly in HTML and Javascript.  To quote:  
>  â€œI was surprised how easy it was to get started with JCR, even for a new programmer like me. I know a little bit of Java, but I mainly write Javascript. So I was really, really happy when I saw how much you can do with JCR and Sling just using HTML and Javascript. Basically, if you can write an HTML form, you can create a useful JCR app, because Sling takes care of a lot of server-side stuff and you really don't need to write Java Server Pages unless you want to. This is a great convenience and makes it possible for programmers of all skill levels to be productive right away with JCR. You don't have to be a Java expert at all."
