[Sandro Groganz](http://sandro.groganz.com/) just tweeted a link to [Kristof Coomans's proposal of a community fork of eZ Publish](http://blog.coomanskristof.be/2009/01/31/ez-publish-to-fork-or-not-to-fork/).  Kristof is about to be a former employee of [eZ Systems Belgium](http://ez.no/company/ez_crew/belgium) and seems to be quite frustrated with eZ's lack of progress and openness with the platform.  
  
To me, this is unfortunate news.  [eZ Systems](http://ez.no) has been making a lot of progress in the media and publishing industry and (to me at least) been improving the platform nicely.  [eZ Systems has also successfully established a beach-head in the United States](http://www.prlog.org/10054697-ez-systems-the-creator-of-ez-publish-goes-to-chicago.html).  I think the one area that they have been lagging is their initiative to port [eZ Publish](http://ez.no/ezpublish) onto the [eZ Components](http://ez.no/ezcomponents) framework.  It would be a shame if the great energy behind this platform were to be fragmented into two competing projects - especially as eZ Systems is poised to [do a major rewrite](http://ez.no/developer/forum/general/ez_project_v_five).  
  
Still, I am not panicking yet.  For now, I am just filing this as a frustrated employee rant.  It takes much more than a rant to start a successful fork.
