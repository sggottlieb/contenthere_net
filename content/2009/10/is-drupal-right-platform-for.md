By now, most people have heard that [whitehouse.gov has been migrated over to Drupal](http://buytaert.net/whitehouse-gov-using-drupal). Apparently, the administration has built a level of comfort with the platform with [its experience using it for recovery.gov](http://www.contenthere.net/2009/02/the-significance-of-recovergov-on-drupal.html). While the Drupal community is doing high fives all around and equating this with being the most powerful CMS in the free world, I wouldn't go that far. I would say that Drupal is a very good choice for powering the kind of website that the Obama administration is trying to foster: content rich, news oriented, faceted, and populist.

  

Apparently, [Slate Magazine's Chris Wilson wasn't so generous with his critique of the choice](http://www.slate.com/id/2233719). I discovered the Slate article by reading Conor McNamara's excellent post  
["Drupal misrepresented by Chris Wilson of slate.com."](http://www.databasepublish.com/blog/messengers-errors-chris-wilsons-flawed-rant-about-drupal-and-whitehousegov) In my opinion, Conor's responses to Wilson's points are spot-on. Some of Wilson's criticisms reflect configuration choices, not limitations of the platform (like not being able to add Javascript to a content objects. It's a bad idea to allow this by the way.). [Slate.fr uses Drupal](http://buytaert.net/slate-fr-using-drupal) and the Today's Pictures section of Slate.com is Drupal powered. It seems like Chris has just enough knowledge to sound ignorant. Readers of my reports know that I can get critical of technologies. But whenever I criticize, I make sure to do my research because I know that I am going to get attacked by defenders of that technology. Chris is about to learn this lesson. If Slate.com's commenting system wasn't so bad, he would learn even faster.
