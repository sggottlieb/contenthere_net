I am looking forward to attending a [Django Master Class, taught by Jacob Kaplan-Moss, on October 16th in Springfield, Virginia](http://holdenweb.com/py/djangomaster/).  I have been building a prototype application for a client in Django over the last couple of months and have been very impressed with the framework.  It looks like the application will be going to Beta soon so it will be great to pick up some expert tricks that will take me to the next level.
