[CMSWire](http://www.cmswire.com) and [Water and Stone](http://www.waterandstone.com/) are conducting a [survey of open source CMS users and implementers](http://bit.ly/24GJES) for an upcoming report on Open Source CMS Market Share.  I don't generally put much stock in CMS popularity contests because they tend to favor products that address the lowest common denominator requirements (that is, brochure websites for sole proprietor-size businesses).  That said, I took the survey and was pleasantly surprised with the depth of information that they are collecting.  In particular, I am interested to know what people consider the most important market filters and also implementation details like the length and cost of implementation.  I hope they include this information in the report.  I also hope that "industrial grade" implementers and customers take part so that the results show a good cross section of the marketplace.  As a participation incentive, there is an opportunity to win a $100 iTunes gift certificate.  How can you pass that up?
