As I [mentioned before](http://www.contenthere.net/2009/02/my-social-network-friend-policy.html), I use many different social media services for different purposes. I realized that I have been unconsciously operating an elaborate decision tree of what to post where. On a whim, I tried to map it out and I found the results interesting.   

A couple of notes...

  

*   The FriendFeed (ff) icons shows what services are aggregated into FriendFeed.  
    
*   I am just starting to use Tumblr again as a sort of personal blog. This exercise helped me realize a use of Tumblr. For a while, I was posting things directly into FriendFeed.   
    
*   Flickr contains work and personal items. I use it for personal pictures (mostly public) and also screen captures of software that I review (kept private).

  

I am wondering if anyone else operates a similar decision tree and how conscious they are of it.
