I am pleased to announce an updated version of my [_Open Source Web Content Management in Alfresco_ report](http://www.contenthere.net/products-page/open-source-content-management-in-java/open-source-content-management-in-alfresco/).  The report evaluates [Alfresco Enterprise 3.1's](http://www.alfresco.com) WCM capabilities for both traditional web publishing and as a framework for building dynamic web applications.  Like all Content Here reports, _Open Source Web Content Management in Alfresco_ is highly technical and gets into details that a potential buyer should know.  In writing the update, I interviewed systems integrators and technology managers from customer companies for their candid opinions of the product and the software vendor.  I have also personally evaluated Alfresco, supporting documentation, and third party books.  I can safely say that you are not going to get a more thorough and unbiased evaluation of Alfresco anywhere — not even if you pay several times the $200 price.  
  
Long time readers know that _Open Source Web Content Management Alfresco_ was originally published in February 2008 as part of a larger report called [_Open Source Web Content Management in Java_](http://www.contenthere.net/products-page/open-source-content-management-in-java/open-source-content-management-in-java-bundle/).  Because all of the products reviewed in that report have undergone significant upgrades, I have been selling it at a deep discount.  The front matter that explains the marketplace and significant portions of the evaluations are still accurate and relevant so I have decided to offer a bundled product consisting of the original report plus the updated Alfresco review for $400 — that is still 50% off of the original list price.  As I complete updates to the different reviews, I will add them to the bundle and incrementally raise the price to the original full price.  
  
If you are evaluating Alfresco for web content management, save yourself time and reduce your risk buy purchasing _Open Source Web Content Management in Alfresco_.  If you work for a Java shop and are starting to consider open source alternatives to commercially licensed web content management software, consider the [Open Source Web Content Management in Java bundle](http://www.contenthere.net/products-page/open-source-content-management-in-java/open-source-content-management-in-java-bundle/).
