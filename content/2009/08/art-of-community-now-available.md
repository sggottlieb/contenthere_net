[Jono Bacon's](http://www.jonobacon.org/) new book [The Art of Community: Building the New Age of Participation (Theory in Practice)](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596156715?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=contenthere-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0596156715)

 is now available. [I first heard about this book in January](http://www.contenthere.net/2009/02/the-art-of-community.html) and I have tracked the progress and discussion on and off since then. As you would expect from a book about community, the development of _The Art of Community_ was a very open process. I must say that I was a little underwhelmed by the activity around the book given the interest in the topic. Number 1 on the list of top 10 commenters had 29 comments. Number 10 had 7. Maybe most of the discussion happened over Twitter where [Jono has over 2,400 followers](http://twitter.com/jonobacon).  

I have no doubt that the book will sell well. Doesn't everyone want to start a community? I just ordered my copy and will post a review here when I get through it. The incumbent for my favorite book in this category is [The Success of Open Source](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0674018583?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=contenthere-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0674018583)

 by Steven Weber. Clay Shirky's [Here Comes Everybody: The Power of Organizing Without Organizations](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1594201536?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=contenthere-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1594201536)

 is also quite good. Both of these books effectively describe the community phenomenon. What may set _The Art of Community_ apart is a set of instructions for creating your own successful community (Jono draws from his experience with [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/) and [KDE](http://www.kde.org/)). But if the techniques work so well, why hasn't the community around the book thrived? Did Jono (who also works as community manager for Ubuntu and is a musician) not have adequate time to write the book implement his techniques?
