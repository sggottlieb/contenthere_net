Readers of the [Drupal for Publishers](http://www.scribd.com/doc/77085653/Drupal-for-Publishers) know that [Drupal](http://drupal.org) lacks a native system for associating different page layouts for different sections or pages on a site.  Sub-layouts are typically implemented with conditional logic in the template code (page.tpl.php).  The [Drupal Panels module](http://drupal.org/project/panels) puts this control in the administrative interface and is becoming widely used within the Drupal community.  To learn more, check out [GotDrupal's excellent video tutorial on Drupal Panels.](http://gotdrupal.com/videos/drupal-panels)  As you can see from the video, the Panels user interface is quite powerful but is also very complicated because you have to create these rules to determine under what conditions a layout should display.  You still probably want a developer or well trained administrator to do the work on a staging environment and then migrate the configurations to the production environment.
