[This great cartoon showing how a product is understood and described by different stakeholders](http://www.projectcartoon.com/cartoon/2) is definitely going in my toolbox for explaining project disfunction. My explanation will be that you can't start to achieve a common understanding of something until get visual. If everyone got together and drew a picture of the solution and then regularly checked in as it was incrementally built, the potential for miscommunication would be nearly zero. [Proofs of concept, prototypes, and pilots are useful for communicating more complex functionality](http://www.contenthere.net/2007/03/poc-prototype-or-pilot-when-and-why.html) â€” Much better than a lengthy detailed written specification.
