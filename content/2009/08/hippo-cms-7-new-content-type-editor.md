Arj√© Cahn posted a short [video demonstrating the Hippo CMS 7's new content type editor](http://blogs.hippo.nl/arje/2009/08/an_improved_template_editor.html). The process is all GUI driven and looks very slick. It is difficult to know whether this is as flexible as the old Hippo CMS 6 system of editing layout and xsd files but it certainly appears easier. It is also nice to see that Hippo CMS 7 maintains the ability to control the layout of the entry form. Most CMS products only let you control the widgets used, their order, and, in some cases, what tab they appear on. Hippo gives the developer control over the layout of the whole form.
