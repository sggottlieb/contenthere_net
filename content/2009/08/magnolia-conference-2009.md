[Magnolia is hosting its first big user conference this September 10th and 11th in Basel Switzerland](http://magnolia-cms.com/conference).  I was going through the program and it looks great.  There are two tracks: one for business users and the other for developers.  The developer track has [a session where David Nüscheler will talk about the new JCR Specification (283)](http://magnolia-cms.com/home/conference/program/speakers.html#DavidN).  There will also be two people from [Texas State University to talk about their work with Magnolia](http://magnolia-cms.com/home/customers/case-studies/texas-state-university.html).  If you are using or considering Magnolia CMS and can talk someone into sending you to Basel, definitely try to go ([register here](http://magnolia-cms.com/home/conference/register.html)).  You can even get a 30% discount off of the €200 standard price if you use the code "mconf09gottlieb".
