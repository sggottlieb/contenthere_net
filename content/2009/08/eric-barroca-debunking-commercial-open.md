[Nuxeo](http://www.nuxeo.com/en/) CEO Éric Barroca has an excellent post that [breaks down the hype and decodes the marketing speak around commercial open source software](http://blogs.nuxeo.com/ebarroca/2009/08/commercial-open-source-or-just-a-free-demo.html). He doesn't name names but he does call out some of the claims and language of some commercial open source vendors.  The general message is this: software vendors should focus on making great products and be clear and direct about what they are selling. There is nothing wrong with selling proprietary software or charging license fees — just be clear about it.  Don't call a license fee something else to give the appearance that the software is free.  Éric also gives a lot of credit to commercial software vendors that contribute to open source (like Atlassian, Day, and IBM) without making a big deal about it.
