[Now that I sorted out this site's mobile problems](http://www.contenthere.net/2012/07/why-the-redesign.html), I feel authorized to complain about mobile issues on other sites. Here are my top four pet peeves.  

  
<ol><br/> <li><br/> <h4>Aggressive App Promotion</h4><br/> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>“I’d LOVE to download your app instead of going to the webpage I just tried to visit!”— No-one, ever. No-one in the future either.</p>— Graham Linehan (@Glinner) <a data-datetime="2012-07-10T19:50:00+00:00" href="https://twitter.com/Glinner/status/222779724567547904">July 10, 2012</a></blockquote><br/><script charset="utf-8" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script><br/> <p>You go to a site and get blocked by a dialog box that encourages you to download their app.  When I click on a link or type a URL, I am sending a pretty clear signal that I want the content that is on the other end.  I am not looking for another app to install.<br/> </p><br/> <p>If you want to promote your app, use a banner ad slot to make a subtle suggestion.  Don't put up an interstitial that breaks the flow.  A few sites do this nicely by putting a small floating tab on the bottom right of the page.</p><br/> </li><br/> <li><br/> <h4>Dialog Boxes</h4><br/> <p>Speaking of dialog boxes, don't put them on your mobile website at all.  If you feel like you need a dialog box, make sure to design it for mobile by making the buttons extra big.  Those tiny x's in the corners just don't cut it.</p><br/> </li><br/> <li><br/> <h4>Flash</h4><br/> <p>The writing has been on the wall for a long time now and, now with Android Jelly Bean dropping Flash support, there is no denying it.  Flash is dead on mobile.  Don't use it — especially if your site is for a restaurant or any other destination for people on the go.</p><br/> </li><br/> <li><br/> <h4>Disjointed Mobile/Full Experience</h4><br/> <p>If your content is any good, it will be shared between users on all sorts of platforms.  Someone might first encounter the content on a mobile device and then want to continue reading on the full experience.  To facilitate this, make it easy for a user to jump between content views.</p><br/> </li><br/> <br/></ol>
