Last week I presented&nbsp;a session about [Marketing Operations](http://gilbaneboston.com/12/conference_program.html#t4 "Marketing Technology and Operations at Gilbane Boston 2012")&nbsp;at the Gilbane Conference. The big idea is that marketing technologies are like bicycles. &nbsp;If you commit the effort, the right technologies will help you get far. &nbsp;But you can't just buy the equipment and expect success.
