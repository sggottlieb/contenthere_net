A few people have been asking me about how my [One Field Job Application experiment](http://www.contenthere.net/2012/08/an-unconventional-approach-to-recruiting.html) turned out ([preliminary results here](http://www.contenthere.net/2012/08/preliminary-results-from-the-one-field-job-application-experiment.html)). We ended up hiring two excellent technical web PMs. [Gerry Tamakloe](https://github.com/Tamakloe) works out of our Dublin Office. Gerry is a powerhouse: helping teams get the most out of our systems. He is not afraid to get into the details of an application and optimize it for an internal or external customer. [Katie Methe](https://twitter.com/katiemethe) works with me here in Massachusetts. In addition to managing projects, Katie handles deployments, QA, troubleshooting of our websites and GMO applications. I bombarded her with new stuff on her first day and she didn't even flinch.  

In addition to finding some great people, this little experiment has reassured me that I am not unreasonable in expecting a web project manager to be capable of both managing people and doing technical tasks. A web project manager should rise to, rather than shrink away from, a technical challenge. Rather than just distributing work, A good web pm adds value to everything he/she touches: whether it be verifying and diagnosing a defect, deploying a fix, doing technical research, or configuring software.
