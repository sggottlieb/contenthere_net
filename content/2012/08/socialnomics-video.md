If you have not already done so, you should definitely watch the promotional video for the book [Socialnomics: How Social Media Transforms the Way We Live and Do Business](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00472OBYI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00472OBYI&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=contenthere-20)

I haven't read the book yet but the video has some pretty intense statistics. This may not revolutionize your content marketing strategy but it will certainly shake your confidence in the status quo. I hope this doesn't make executives snap to the reactionary decision of "we need to get on Facebook." It would be much better for someone to think "we need to deliver a product/service that people want to rave about." If you can do that, those customers will be gushing about you on whatever social network is currently popular with the customers you want to reach.
