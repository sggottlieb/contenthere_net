[Ahava Leibtag (@ahaval)](https://twitter.com/ahaval) from [Aha Media Group](http://www.ahamediagroup.com/) and I recently finished a new white paper called ["Three First Steps to Operationalizing Your Content Marketing"](http://info.lionbridge.com/content-marketing-operations-ebook.html?utm_name=contentoperationsebook&amp;utm_source=contenthere&amp;utm_medium=blog).  

In the white paper we discuss the huge gap between strategy and execution. While marketing organizations often think about strategy, business results are achieved through sustained execution â€” not short term initiatives like task forces and website redesigns. This goes back to a theme that I have been talking about for years: [your website is not a project](http://www.contenthere.net/2010/06/jeff-cram-your-website-is-not-a-project.html). Back then I liked to talk about a website as a "product" that needs to be continually maintained and improved. Given that product management is not a common strength in organizations (why can't more people just follow the "[make it suck less](http://www.codesimplicity.com/post/suck-less/)" philosophy?), I have started to talk about the web and other forms of digital communications as a "program." Still not great, but at least it sounds less cheesy than to say "it's a journey."   

No matter what you call it, it takes time and effort to build the trust and attention of an audience. And the only way to do it cost-effectively is to be operationally efficient. You need to be able to prioritize your goals and commit to a plan; then have the team to execute it. This white paper has three parts:  

   

*   Obstacles that stand in the way of organizations establishing effective content marketing programs.  
    
*   Getting started. How to identify audiences and develop a strategy to reach them.  
    
*   How to baseline where you are right now so you can measure the effectiveness of your activities.
