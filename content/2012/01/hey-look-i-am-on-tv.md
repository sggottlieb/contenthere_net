Last week I had the privilege of joining [Scott Liewehr](https://twitter.com/#!/sliewehr) on [CMS Connected](http://www.cms-connected.com/), a web television show about content management. The topic was "[2011 WCM Year in Review](http://www.cms-connected.com/Previous-Shows/Web-CMS-Year-in-Review-2011.aspx)" and we covered a lot of ground: mobile, engagement, and the cloud. [Tom Wentworth](https://twitter.com/#!/twentworth12), from [Ektron](http://www.ektron.com/) dropped in on Skype for a cameo appearance too.  

I had a great time and folks on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/#!/search/cmsconnected) seemed to enjoy the conversation as well. You can watch it [here](http://www.cms-connected.com/Previous-Shows/Web-CMS-Year-in-Review-2011.aspx). I also got to meet [Butch Stearns](http://butchstearns.tumblr.com/) who I know from listening to [WEEI](http://www.weei.com/).  

Big thanks to [Tyler Pyburn](https://twitter.com/#!/typyburn) and [The Pulse Network](http://www.thepulsenetwork.com/) for hosting and [Falcon-Software](http://www.falcon-software.com/) for their generous sponsorship.
