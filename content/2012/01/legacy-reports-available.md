If you read Content Here through RSS or just follow links to individual articles, you may have missed my new [publications page](http://www.contenthere.net/publications). In addition to listing some articles that I have published on other sites, the publications page now includes reports that I used to sell here at Content Here. I have not kept these reports up to date with the technologies that they cover but the background information and selection strategies are still very relevant. They are posted up on [Scribd](http://www.scribd.com/sggottlieb) where they are free to read. You may find the following reports particularly interesting.

    ### [Open Source Web Content Management in Java](http://www.scribd.com/doc/77090148/Open-Source-Web-Content-Management-in-Java)
    
      
     
    
    This was Content Here's first report. It reviewed 7 open source Java web content management systems (Alfresco, Apache Lenya, Daisy, Hippo, Jahia, Magnolia, and OpenCms). While the individual product reviews are all out of date, the first 20 pages of the 173 page report contain useful information on the rise of open source content management and how evaluating open source platforms is different from commercial platforms

    ### [Open Source Web Content Management in Alfresco](http://www.scribd.com/doc/77087023/Open-Source-Web-Content-Management-in-Alfresco)
    
      
     
    
    This is the Alfresco review from _Open Source Web Content Management in Java_ but updated to version 3.1 which was released in April of 2009.

    ### [Drupal for Publishers](http://www.scribd.com/doc/77085653/Drupal-for-Publishers)
    
      
     
    
    This is my most recent report. It was published in 2009 and covers Drupal 6.10. The interesting thing about this format is that it reviewed Drupal from the perspective of a publisher. The report is broken up into 3 sections: "what the publisher needs to know," "what the editor needs to know," and "what the developer needs to know." I think that much of the general commentary is still very relevant.
