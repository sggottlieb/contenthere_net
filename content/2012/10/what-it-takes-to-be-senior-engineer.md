John Allspaw (SVP of Technical Operations at Etsy) recently published an excellent article about what it means to be a senior engineer: "[On Being a Senior Engineer](http://www.kitchensoap.com/2012/10/25/on-being-a-senior-engineer/ "On Being a Senior Engineer")". &nbsp;It's long but worth every word. &nbsp;It made me think of all of the colleagues that I worked with over the years. It also made me think of how little justice the title "Senior Engineer" does to this role. &nbsp;When recruiters look for senior engineers or senior software developers, they are basically asking for coders with some experience - perhaps on their second job out of college. &nbsp;Developers expect this title as a birthright after putting in a few years.  
  
Allspaw's definition calls for characteristics that not everyone will acquire no matter how many years on the job. &nbsp;It makes me wonder if it would be more practical to use a different name for the role rather than redefine a term that most people use differently. &nbsp;The problem with the word "senior" is that it implies that it is part of a normal growth path. &nbsp;While I would love this to be the case, my experience is that most developers are not heading in that direction.  
  
Another thought that I had is that most companies under-appreciate the role of senior engineer. &nbsp;Perhaps their businesses do not require need these talents. &nbsp;Maybe it is sufficient to have a project manager working with a number of non-senior developers. &nbsp;I would say that all web and software companies should definitely appreciate and cultivate this role. &nbsp;But does a bricks and mortar company with a commerce site on the side need a senior engineer? &nbsp;If not, what happens if the non-senior engineer starts to develop senior traits? &nbsp;Does she change jobs or do you move her out of software engineering to a pure management role?  
  
Anyway, I thoroughly enjoyed the article. &nbsp;It really made me think about recruiting and careers in technology.
