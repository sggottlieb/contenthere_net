I recently got an announcement for Perforce about their [new Git Fusion product](http://www.perforce.com/company/press-room/perforce-git-fusion "Git Fusion").  I never really loved Perforce as a source code management system (I probably didn't used it long enough to get used to it like I did with StarTeam, SVN, and Git); but I love how the company is building new products on top of the Perforce foundation.  This summer I caught a demo of their web content management product [Perforce Chronicle](http://www.perforce.com/products/chronicle "Perforce Chronicle") and was impressed.  You don't normally see sophisticated versioning and staging functionality like that in a CMS in that price point.   
  
Nice work Perforce!
