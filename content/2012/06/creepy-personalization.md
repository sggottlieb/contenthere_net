The New York Times has an interesting article about eCommerce personalization - [_E-Tailer Customization: Convenient or Creepy?_](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/24/technology/e-tailer-customization-whats-convenient-and-whats-just-plain-creepy.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all). The big take-away here is that if you want to experiment personalization, you need to be prepared to adjust because the results may be the opposite of what you want. [Before you implement sophisticated display logic, you need to build the capacity to manage it.](http://www.contenthere.net/2011/09/context-and-the-future-of-web-content-management.html) Otherwise your visitors will probably be worse off than if you did nothing.
