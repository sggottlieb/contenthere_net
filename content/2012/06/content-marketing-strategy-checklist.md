I really enjoyed reading [Velocity's Big Fat B2B Content Marketing Strategy Checklist](http://www.velocitypartners.co.uk/b2b-content-marketing-strategy-checklist/). In addition to it's irreverent tone and design, the checklist is great because it forces the reader to think through all that goes into a successful marketing program. Of special interest to marketing operations folks is the "Flog It" section which talks about getting the most leverage out of content: promotion, lead nurturing, atomization (creating sub pieces derived off of the main piece), and measurement.  

Most people outside of marketing operations discount the effort that goes in after the content is finalized and ready for publishing. It really is just the beginning. The best results are achieved by nailing the publishing and post-publishing activities.
