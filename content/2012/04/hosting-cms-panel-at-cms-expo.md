On May 8th, I will be hosting a panel at [CMS Expo](http://cmsexpo.net) called "[CMS Review - Compare CMSs For Web Design Studios &amp; Development Firms](http://cmsexpo.net/sessions/2-152-CMS_Review___Compare_CMSs_For_Web_Design_Studios_&amp;_Development_Firms)." The panel is designed to help web design and development shops build their CMS portfolios. Selecting the right platforms to take to market is extremely important because building competency with these technologies takes time and your projects are risky until you do.  

In the panel, we will be focusing on the topics most relevant to studios and integrators:

  

*   The types of sites that the platform is best suited for.  
    
*   Market awareness in industry verticals.  
    
*   Availability and quality of training and support.  
    

  

This session would also be useful for an internal services group that does web design and development projects for departments within the organization.

  

I will be around pretty much the whole conference. Look for me if you want to chat about CMS selection, localization, or marketing operations. If you haven't registered yet, use the code Seth2012 for a 10% off discount.
