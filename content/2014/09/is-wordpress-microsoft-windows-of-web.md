We run our corporate marketing sites on Wordpress. It's not the perfect web content management system for us but, as long as we keep things simple, it does the job reasonably well. When we want to do something that Wordpress doesn't comfortably handle, we tend to use an alternative platform such as Marketo, UnBounce, or develop static web pages.  
  
Wordpress is great, but one thing to consider when using it is that you make yourself a target to all sorts of hacker attacks. When planning server capacity, we need to accept that a lot of our traffic comes from bots trying to hack into WP Admin. There are three things about Wordpress that contribute to this.  

  
 2.   __Wordpress is by far the most commonly used web content management system.__ [According to BuiltWith, 47.90% of CMS powered websites run on WordPress](http://trends.builtwith.com/cms). The second most commonly used CMS is Drupal with 13.10%. Now I know that those statistics are not perfect but it is clear that Wordpress is head and shoulders above the competition when it comes to CMS adoption.
  
 4.   __Wordpress is incredibly easy to identify.__ If you look at the source of any Wordpress generated page, Wordpress's signature is impossible to miss. Moreover, Wordpress makes it really hard to hide these tells even if you wanted to.
  
 6.   __Wordpress is the "go-to" platform for people who know nothing about web development or security.__ While there are plenty of savvy WordPress developers out there, the majority of WordPress sites were built by people with no clue about security and operated by companies with limited technical know-how. Many of these sites were insecure from day one and only got worse as patching and other maintenance practices were neglected.
  

  
Put these three facts together and it is obvious why WordPress is the most attractive platform for hackers and botnets to attack. If you are a malicious hacker and want to get the most out of your efforts, you go after the biggest and most vulnerable target. And in that way, WordPress is a lot like Windows. Windows is everywhere because it is the go-to OS for people who just want a computer at a reasonable price. If you walk into a BestBuy/Staples/Costco to buy a computer, you will walk out with a Windows PC unless you have something else in mind. The majority of these computer shoppers know very little about managing their computers. These users will not keep their software up to date and will accept any dialog. Most of us have spent countless holiday hours removing adware, browser bars, and viruses from these computers.  
  
Just to be clear: Wordpress and Windows are not inherently insecure. With conscientious maintenance, both of these platforms can be as safe to use as the alternatives. It as a sign of success for both Windows and Wordpress that they have earned the distinction of being prime targets for hackers. It is also a great opportunity for external software companies to market services to secure these platforms. The Windows security software market is already large and mature. The number of Wordpress security options is growing fast.  
  
So my advice to everyone is to keep on using Wordpress if it meets your requirements. But accept that your site will be a target for hackers and plan for security. Work with Wordpress specialists (not designers who happen to know a little about Wordpress theming). Follow all the advice in the ["Hardening Wordpress" page](http://codex.wordpress.org/Hardening_WordPress). Look into 3rd party services that help protect your site. Be safe
