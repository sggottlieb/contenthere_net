Update:  I posted my slides [here](http://contenthere.net/presentations/OSSMythBusters_no_pics.ppt).    
  
I did a presentation called Open Source MythBusters at the [Fall 2006 Gilbane Conference on Content Technologies](http://gilbaneboston.com/06/) in Boston.  Gilbane still has not posted my slides but Toby Ward did a nice [summary](http://www.prescientdigital.com/articles/intranet-articles/open-source-myths/) in his blog.
