It has been a long time coming but [Drupal 5](http://drupal.org/drupal-5.0) is finally here.  [Jeff Robbins](http://www.lullabot.com/about/jeffrobbins) from [Lullabot](http://www.lullabot.com/) has a [great screencast](http://ftp.osuosl.org/pub/drupal/files/videocasts/5-whats-new.mp4) showing the new features.  Key enhancements include better administration interfaces, more tunable caching, and integration with the popular Javascript library [jQuery](http://jquery.com/).
