I just [posted](http://www.cmpros.org/resources/podcasts/malcontents/episode-5---xml-publishing) the latest episode of [The Malcontents](http://themalcontents.blogspot.com/2007/01/episode-5-xml-publishing.html#links) podcast.   Our guests were Rahel Bailie from [Intentional Design](http://www.intentionaldesign.ca/) and Scott, [The Content Wrangler](http://www.thecontentwrangler.com/), Abel.  We had a great discussion about the needs of content producers and how to maximize efficiency and quality through better content management practices.
