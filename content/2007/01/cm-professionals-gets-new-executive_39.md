CM Professionals will be getting a new Executive Director ([press release](http://www.cmprofessionals.org/about-cm-pros/news/scott-abel-named-executive-director-of-cm-professionals)).  [Scott Abel](http://www.thecontentwrangler.com/) is a human dynamo and I am so happy that he will be filling this role.  Executive Director is a paid part time position so Scott will have even more time to dedicate to CM Professionals.  This also opens up more slot on the Board of Directors: a one year term.  The [election process](http://www.cmprofessionals.org/about-cm-pros/organization/elections) is just starting.  So if you are interested in helping shape the future of the organization and the Content Management discipline, you should throw your metadata into the ring.
