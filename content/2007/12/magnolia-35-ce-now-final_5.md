Magnolia 3.5 Community Edition is now GA. It will probably be a little while before the Enterprise Edition is final. But at least it is on the horizon. See [my earlier post for a list of what is in the release](http://contenthere.blogspot.com/2007/11/magnolia-community-edition-35-rc1.html). The big differences between Enterprise and Community Edition are Magnolia's Site Designer (a WYSIWYG editor for developing display templates), a JSR-168 (portlet spec) connector, the option to use Day's CRX rather than Apache JackRabbit for a repository, and, of course, the ability to buy support.
