Alan Pelz-Sharpe has a great post on the CMS Watch Trend Watch blog that [describes the difference between back up and archiving](http://www.cmswatch.com/Trends/1084-Backup-is-not-Archiving?source=RSS) (they are not the same). He makes the point more articulately than I ever could so I will encourage you to [click through.](http://www.cmswatch.com/Trends/1084-Backup-is-not-Archiving?source=RSS) Alan goes on to say:

  
<blockquote><br/> <p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica">2008 will see ECM vendors aggressively trying to move into the archiving sector. It's a move driven (as all meaningful market dynamics are) by buyer demand. At the moment, demand stems less from a full understanding of retention and archiving, and more from the need to shift ballooning volumes of e-mails (e-mails that may well become the focus of a laywer at some future date), that are swamping mail servers.</p><br/></blockquote>  

If ECM vendors respond to the stated need of handling larger volumes of data, I doubt that their solutions will address the core need of organizing and filtering information into a useful archive. Are [we talking about bigger refrigerator doors](http://contenthere.blogspot.com/2007/11/cms-business-case.html)? In the case of email, will their solutions be smart enough not to "archive" marketing, personal, and other email with no legal value?
