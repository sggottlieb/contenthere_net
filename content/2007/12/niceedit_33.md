If you have a custom web application that does not necessarily need a full CMS but could use a WYSIWYG editor, there are a number of open source Javascript rich text editors out there that are not too difficult to plug in. The big ones are [TinyMCE](http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/), [FCK](http://www.fckeditor.net/), and [Kupu](http://kupu.oscom.org/). If you just need something simple, you might consider [NiceEdit](http://nicedit.com/index.php). It just has the basics (bold, underline, italics, left/right/center justification, bullets, indent, font size/family, links and images) but it looks easy to install and may be just what you need.
