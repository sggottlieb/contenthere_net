David Neuscheler, CTO of [Day Software](http://www.day.com/), was just nominated by the [JCP](http://jcp.org/en/home/index) for the Most Outstanding Spec Lead Award for his work on [JSR 283](http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=283).  JSR 283 takes the Java Content Repository ([JSR 170](http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=283)) further by adding enhancements like federation, remoting, more standard node types, and better access control.  JSR 283 was  first introduced in October 2005 and these things typically take a long time to make their way through.  In the first go around with JSR 170, the team kept momentum by building an open source reference implementation: [Apache JackRabbit](http://jackrabbit.apache.org/).  [According](http://jazoon.com/en/conference/presentationdetails.html?type=sid&amp;detail=862) to [Zukka Zitting](http://jazoon.com/en/conference/speakerdetails.html?type=author&amp;detail=Jukka_Zitting), JackRabbit (or at least a branch of it) will be used as a reference implementation for JCR 283.
