I will be [presenting](http://www.webcontent2007.com/programsDetails.html#open) at the [Web Content 2007](http://www.webcontent2007.com/index.html) conference in Chicago next month.  This is a  first  time conference with a great [speakers list](http://www.webcontent2007.com/speakers.html).  If you [register](http://www.gifttool.com/registrar/ShowEventDetails?ID=1208&amp;EID=1536) before June 1, you save a hundred bucks.  Hopefully I will see you there.  
  
A couple of days later, I will be on an [Enterprise Search panel](http://www.enterprise2conf.com/conference/foundations-for-enterprise-20.php#1182322800) at the [Enterprise 2.0 Conference](http://www.enterprise2conf.com/index.php) in Boston.  I think this one is going to be interesting because my co-panelists all come from search software vendors.  There is an interesting tension between the content management market and the search market.  Content managers and information architects focus on organizing  and structuring content to make it more usable, accessible, and findable.  Nirvana for search vendors is not having to care about how the content is organized and stored.  Of course, everyone can agree that the content must be worth finding.  That may be the common ground that we can all start working from.
