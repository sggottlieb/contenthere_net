If you have been holding out for OpenCms to come out with version 7, your wait is almost over. The OpenCms team [just announced](http://www.opencms.org/opencms/en/shownews.html?id=1195) that the first release candidate (RC1) is available in CVS and will soon be packaged for download on [www.opencms.org](http://www.opencms.org). The stable version is expected to be out in July.  

For perspective, v7 is probably as big an upgrade as v6 (released 2 years ago) was over v5. Whereas v6 introduced in-site editing functionality (called "Direct Edit") and better support for structured content, v7 brings goodies like WebDAV support (now developers can use their favorite IDE to edit presentation templates!) and a dependency engine that will do a better job of managing links and automatically publish related content (so an image will be published if the article that references it is published). Version 7 will also have much improved user management. For a list of other enhancements, check out the [press release](http://www.opencms.org/opencms/en/shownews.html?id=1195).
