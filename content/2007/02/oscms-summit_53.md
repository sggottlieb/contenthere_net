There will be an [Open Source CMS Summit](http://2007.oscms-summit.org/) this Spring (March 22nd and 23rd) at [Yahoo](http://www.yahoo.com/) headquarters in Sunnyvale, CA.  The [Drupal](http://drupal.org/) project is spearheading it but all other projects are invited to participate.  With the decline of [OSCOM](http://www.oscom.org/), it is nice to see these kind of events happening.  Project teams learn from other projects' strengths and experiences.  Most of the current proposals are about [Drupal](http://drupal.org/) and [Munwar Shariff](http://www.packtpub.com/author_view_profile/id/116) is also planning to talk about [Alfresco](http://www.alfresco.com/) (He just published an  [Alfresco book](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAlfresco-Enterprise-Content-Management-Implementation%2Fdp%2F1904811116%2Fsr%3D1-1%2Fqid%3D1171245949%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks&amp;amp;tag=contenthere-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325)

.  Review from me coming soon).  
  
You might remember [Drupal](http://drupal.org/) and [eZ publish](http://ez.no/) put on a [similar conference in Vancouver last year](http://drupal.org/conference-vancouver-2006).   I found out about it pretty late, as did the general OSCOM community that was battling inertia of organizing a conference of their own.  I heard it was a great time.
