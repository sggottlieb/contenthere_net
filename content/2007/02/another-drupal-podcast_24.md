[Here](http://ftp.osuosl.org/pub/drupal/files/videocasts/5-tour.mov) is Robert Safuto's ([Awakened Voice](http://www.awakenedvoice.com/)) Drupal screencast showing Drupal 5.   This screencast is longer and starts at a more basic level than Jeff Robbins Drupal [screencast](http://ftp.osuosl.org/pub/drupal/files/videocasts/5-whats-new.mp4) which mainly highlights what is new in Version 5.  A very good introduction to what Drupal is and what you can do with it.  Tip of the hat to [Dries](http://www.buytaert.net/) for [pointing it out](http://www.buytaert.net/drupal-5-introduction).
