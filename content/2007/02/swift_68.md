<p class="flickr-yourcomment">	If you run Windows, it is easy to overlook the <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/safari/">Safari</a> web browser when testing a web application.  Ideally, you can use this limitation as an excuse to buy a Mac.  However, if your employer doesn't buy it, consider the <a href="http://try.swift.ws/index.php?title=Main_Page">Swift Browser</a>.  It uses the same rendering engine used in Safari but runs on Windows.   I installed it and, although it is very poor functionality-wise, it worked.  Hint:  to get the address bar, you may need to click the tiny triangle in the upper right side of the page (see screenshot).</p>
