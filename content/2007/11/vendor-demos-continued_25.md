Following in the vein of Tony Byrne's [10 Steps to a Successful Vendor Demo](http://www.cmswatch.com/Feature/163-Better-Demos) and my post on [how to sit through one](http://www.contenthere.net/2007/09/how-to-make-the-most-out-of-a-vendor-demo.html) , here is a link to Joel Spolsky's [How to Demo Software](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2007/11/16.html) article. Besides being an entertaining read (as all Joel's posts are), I think this article re-enforces the importance of the performance and other production values to a vendor demo.
