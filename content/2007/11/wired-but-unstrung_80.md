I am sitting on the plane on the way back from a wonderful time at [CMF2007](http://cmf2007.dk) ([pics](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/cmf2007/)) in Aarhus. Thanks to Janus, Sara, Flemming (my guardian angel), and the rest of the J. Boye crew for putting together a fantastic conference.

  

Before taking the trip, I made some changes to my computing toolkit to help me be more productive in the air. For those who don't know me, I am a proponent of server side tools for managing information. I use services like [Bloglines](http://www.bloglines.com/) for reading blogs, Wikis and Google Notebook/Docs for writing, and [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us) for bookmarks. Ideally I should be able to log onto any computer, connect to the Internet, and have everything I need.

  

The first change that I made was to migrate from my beloved Bloglines to [Google Reader.](http://www.google.com/reader/view/) While, I prefer the functionality and behavior of Bloglines to Reader, the addition of [Google Gears](http://gears.google.com/) makes Reader a perfect online/offline tool. I can still access my feeds from any computer but I can take my little slice of the web with me when I am offline. According to [feedburner,](http://www.feedburner.com) my immigration appears to be on the tail end of a trend. The Reader wedge of the subscriber pie chart grows in proportion to Blogline's decline.

  

I also installed the blogging client [Ecto](http://infinite-sushi.com/software/ecto/), which I am finding preferable to the [Blogger](http://www.blogger.com) web client because it adds little touches that are difficult to reliably support in a cross-browser web client. If it were not for packed airplanes with coach seats that are too small to work in, wasted time in the air would be a perfect place to catch up on writing blogs. From a business class seat, or at least Economy Plus, Ecto would be even better.

  

And with that, I will dig my laptop out of my chest, power down, and watch the in-flight movie.
