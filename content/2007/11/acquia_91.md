CMS Watch just [reported about a new start-up](http://www.cmswatch.com/Trends/1086-VC-funding-for-Drupal?) called [Acquia](http://acquia.com/) that will provide services and products around [Drupal](http://drupal.org). Acquia is different from some of the other companies that have tried to make money off the Drupal phenomenon. Unlike [SpikeSource,](http://www.spikesource.com/) that operates independently from the Drupal community, Acquia has none other than Drupal founder Dries Buytaert on board - he is the CTO. I am intrigued to learn more about what Acquia is going to do and, more importantly, how it will be regarded by the community. It is worth noting that the Drupal trademark and domain belong to Dries - not the recently formed [Drupal Association](http://association.drupal.org).
