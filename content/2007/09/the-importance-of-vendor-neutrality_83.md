I was just reading&nbsp;[CMS Watch Commentary](http://www.cmswatch.com/Commentary/) today and noticed Alan Peltz-Sharpe's [post](http://www.cmswatch.com/Trends/1010-Uncle-Sam-cracks-down-on-vendor-selection-abuse?source=RSS) about the Department of Justice suing [Accenture](http://www.accenture.com/) for <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;">allegedly</span> (who are we kidding, we KNOW they did it!) colluding with a software vendor and recommending the product based on kick-backs.  See [full story](http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2007/04/gov_sues_accent.html). These are the times it feels very good to be a vendor neutral technology strategy consultant.  The collusion between systems integrators (and some large analyst firms) ranges from trivial to flagrant. &nbsp;Even if there are no monetary kickbacks on a software deal, there is usually some kind of bias. A systems integrator (or more accurately, individuals on a sales team) is going to pitch the product that they know best in order to reduce their risk. In fact, you don't necessarily want a systems integrator to propose a solution that they are going to learn on your billable time. Software vendor partnerships may exert pressure to prioritize a certain solution. My recommendation would be to accept that systems integrators are biased (that they <span style="font-style:italic;">need</span> to be biased) and put their recommendation within that context.  Maybe talk to a couple of SI's that specialize in different products. Or, better yet, talk to someone like [Content Here](http://www.contenthere.net/) who can afford to be vendor neutral and have them connect you with the right technology <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;">and&nbsp;</span> the right integrator.  There's my bias talking! &nbsp;Seriously, it was probably foolish for the Department of Justice to expect an unbiased recommendation from Accenture. I just hope they didn't waste too many tax dollars buying it.
