I was Skyping with someone a couple of days ago and he was referring me to a URL that he decided it would be better to type.  One reason was it was not in English and I have no foreign language skills.  The other reason was the URL was <http://www.maatschappelijkverantwoordondernemen.be>.  Now <span style="font-weight:bold;"><span style="font-style:italic;">that</span></span> is a URL.   I recently saw a presentation by David Esrati from [The Next Wave](http://www.thenextwave.biz) where he talked about his [80-40 Rule](http://www.thenextwave.biz/tnw/?p=333).  The basic idea is that URLs are less important because 80% of browsing starts in the search box.  40% of users are so clueless that they type the URL in the search box.  If this is true, having an awkward domain name is not so much of a problem.  Social bookmarking and blogs probably help too.  But I assume that there are [limits to acceptable awkwardness](http://www.onedegree.ca/2007/03/15/clownpenisfart-snl-proves-domains-matter).  
  
BTW, kudos to J Rulnick for having the foresight to register [chargoggagoggmanchauggagoggchaubunagungamaugg.com](http://ww.w.chargoggagoggmanchauggagoggchaubunagungamaugg.com) after the [longest place name](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Chaubunagungamaug) in the United States!  He gets the 80-40 rule!  I think?
