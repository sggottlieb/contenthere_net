I have started a new company.   [Content Here](http://www.contenthere.net/) is a vendor neutral consulting and analyst firm specializing in content technology selection and architecture.  While I will continue to focus on open source technologies, I have expanded my scope to be able to recommend proprietary software and SaaS where appropriate.  Read [here](http://www.contenthere.net/) for a list of services.  
  
The decision to leave [Optaros](http://www.optaros.com/) was a hard one.   As the seventh employee, I am proud to have helped build a great company and to have been part of such a talented team.   Optaros is doing a tremendous job [implementing Next Generation Internet applications](http://www.optaros.com/en/approach) for clients, and will continue to grow as a premier systems integration firm and thought leader (check out some great employee blogs:  [John Eckman](http://www.openparenthesis.org/), [Erik Smartt](http://www.eriksmartt.com/blog/), [Sebastian Wohlrapp](http://blog.wohlrapp.com/), [Lukas Kahwe Smith](http://pooteeweet.org/), and [Hugo Schotman](http://log.hugoschotman.com/)).  My interests are more focused on strategic technology consulting and analysis.   
  
My goal is to keep doing what I've been doing: writing, publishing, consulting, and helping to make good companies even better with strategic technology decisions.  I will continue to collaborate with companies like [CMS Watch](http://www.cmswatch.com/) to complement their broad market perspective with my specific areas of expertise.  Plus, I intend to publish a couple of reports on my own.  If you want to learn more, please drop a note to [seth@contenthere.net.](mailto://seth@contenthere.net)
