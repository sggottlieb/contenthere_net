Bryant and I just posted the latest [installment](http://themalcontents.blogspot.com/2007/03/episode-7-intranets.html) of [The Malcontents](http://themalcontents.blogspot.com/).  This week we hosted [Toby Ward](http:///) from [Prescient Digital](http://www.prescientdigital.com/) and [James Robertson](http://www.steptwo.com.au/columntwo/index.html) from [Step Two Designs](http://www.steptwo.com.au/) to talk about the promise, successes and disappointments of corporate intranets and what can be done to improve matters.  In addition to crossing many time zones (GMT-8, GMT-5, GMT+11) we covered a lot of ground:  

*   The value that a good intranet can bring
*   The current average grade of an intranet
*   The amount of interest that companies have in improving their intranet
*   Tools and how best to use them
*   Why companies fail in their intranet initiatives

Will the much awaited [MOSS 2007](http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepointserver/FX100492001033.aspx) solve all that?  You will have to listen and find out!
