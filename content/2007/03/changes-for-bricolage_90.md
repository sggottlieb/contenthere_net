[Stefano Mazzocchi](http://www.betaversion.org/%7Estefano/linotype/), who has been called a "serial community builder" and has lead a few [ASF](http://www.apache.org/) projects, once told me that the only true measure of the strength of a community is how it endures a change in leadership. Well, the [Bricolage](http://www.bricolage.cc/) community is about to find out how strong it is. [David Wheeler](http://www.justatheory.com/) who, under his company [Kineticode](http://www.kineticode.com/), has been the driving force behind the [Bricolage project](http://www.kineticode.com/), has taken a full time job with [Values of n](http://www.raelity.org/), to help build a new product called [Stikkit](http://stikkit.com/).  

In an email posted on the Bricolage list, David pledged to stay engaged with the community and remain a committer on the project, but said he will not be able to devote as much time to developing and extending the platform himself. He put out a call for others to actively contribute and step up into a leadership role. While the Bricolage community has a critical mass, David's energy has really kept the project going. He answers most of the questions on the list and takes ownership of most of the operations and enhanceme<a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="return false;" tabindex="7"><span></span></a>nt ideas. In these cases, you never know whether having one really active member enables others to be more passive or whether that active member is just filling a vacuum. It looks like we are about to find out.  

There are a number of companies that use Bricolage. Each one has a clear motivation to keep the community energized. It remains to be seen whether they will invest their time to do it. I have been watching Bricolage for quite some time and I hope that we see a new leader grow out of this change.
