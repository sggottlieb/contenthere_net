A new community site just launched on the [Drupal](http://drupal.org) platform.  [The Date Vine](http://www.thedatevine.com/) is a site where people can post things to do and places to go.  Despite the name, the activities are not all romantic.    
  
This kind of site is the perfect use for Drupal.  The tagging framework ("vocabularies") allows users to categorize their entries so that they appear in different lists of content.  A voting module allows authenticated users to give listings star-based ratings.  The captcha module verifies that a human being is registering for the site.  The favorites module is used so that users can quickly go back to entries they like.  Plus there is the normal Drupal features like commenting, search, etc.  
  
Overall, a really nice use of Drupal.  Now, if only they had a section of the site for Northampton, Massachusetts (currently only Boston, London, Los Angeles, New York, Paris, San Francisco, and Seattle are listed), then I would get really excited.  On second thought, I guess my little town would look a little silly on that list of cities.
