Russ Danner, from the [Christian Science Monitor](http://www.csmonitor.com/), is hosting a Boston Alfresco User Group meeting at the Monitors offices in the heart of Boston's back bay.  This originally modest idea has grown into quite a big event with presentations from [Rivet Logic](http://www.rivetlogic.com/), [Optaros](http://www.optaros.com/), and [Alfresco](http://www.alfresco.com/) (maybe).  I [posted the details](http://upcoming.org/event/156427/) of the event on [Upcoming.org](http://upcoming.org/) but here are the highlights to save you a click:
