The [Bricolage](http://www.bricolage.cc) list has been quite active recently with announcements of new sites and a good discussion about integrating Bricolage into a dynamic presentation tier.  You should definitely check out the recently re-launched [SportsNet CA](http://www.sportsnet.ca/).  The home page is very dynamic with lots of multi-media and rapidly changing content like sports scores.    
  
There was also an anouncement of a Bricolage community newsletter called [Output Channel](http://bricolage.cc/news/2007/10/29/).  Pretty good for a project that was left for dead by [one reviewer](http://www.nautis.com/2007/08/17/cms-review-bricolage/).
