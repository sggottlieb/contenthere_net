The second installment of our three part series on Web 2.0 content management has been [published on CMSWire](http://www.cmswire.com/cms/web-cms/what-is-web-20-cm-part-2-001223.php).  In this article Brice and I discuss how a Web 2.o enabled WCM product should serve three audiences: internal content producers, the external human audience, and the machine or software audience.   As always, feedback is welcome.
