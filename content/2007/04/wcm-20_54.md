At the risk of adding to the confusion and hype, Brice Dunwoodie ([CMSWire](http://www.cmswire.com)) and I just released the first of a 3 part series on Web 2.0 and content management.  In [this article](http://www.cmswire.com/tgo/?id=001187), we define Web 2.0 in practical terms that can be applied to web content management.  Our next two articles will focus on functionality that will be critical for Web 2.0 "compliance" and the adjustments that WCM customers and vendors will need to make to stay current.  I consider Brice and myself to be reasonable and realistic people.  We tend not to get swept up in the hype.  Yet both of use are seeing profound changes on the web.  Not keeping up with these developments will probably not translate into ruin for your business, but may lead to to some missed opportunities.  Brice and I are looking forward to getting your feedback.
