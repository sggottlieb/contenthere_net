On May 2nd, the [Boston PHP user group is going to host](http://www.bostonphp.org/content/view/69/2/) [Moshe Weitzman](http://www.tejasa.com/) ([Drupal](http://drupal.org) core developer) and Kenneth Downs (founder of the [Andromeda project](http://www.andromeda-project.org/)) to talk about their respective frameworks.  I missed the first two framework sessions but I am going to try to make it to this one.  Here are the details:  
>    
> 6:30PM  
> Wednesday, May 2nd  
> IBM  
> 1 Rogers Street  
> Cambridge, MA  
> [directions](http://www.bostonphp.org/component/option,com_gigcal/task,details/gigcal_gigs_id,27/)  
>
