[SDL International](http://www.sdl.com) just [announced](http://www.sdl.com/company/press-releases-archive-2007-sdl/press-release-sdl.htm?id=1140) that they will acquire [Tridion](http://www.tridion.com/).  This is very interesting news because The Netherlands based Tridion seems poised to make quite an impact on the North American mid level WCM market.  They have just started to aggressively market in the States and the product is already popping up on selection short lists that typically include [Ektron](http://www.ektron.com) and [SiteCore](http://sitecore.com/).  SDL is a combination software/services company focused on global information management.  Not long ago, they acquired Trados.
