The GA release of [Plone 3.0](http://plone.org/products/plone/releases/3.0) is right around the corner (due out August 21) and there are many new features to look forward to.  Unlike 2.5 which was a primarily architectural release, 3.0 focuses on the user interface.  Jon Stahl does an excellent job of summarizing the key improvements in his post ["8 Really Cool Things About Plone 3."](http://blogs.onenw.org/jon/archives/2007/07/16/8-really-cool-things-about-plone-3/)  You can download [release candidate 2 here](http://plone.org/products/plone/releases/3.0). The features that I think are the most significant are:  

*   versioning, staging and locking  
    
*   more granular workflow control  
    
*   a dependency manager called "link integrity" that prevents broken links  
    
*   and lots of improvements to the Kupu rich text editor.
