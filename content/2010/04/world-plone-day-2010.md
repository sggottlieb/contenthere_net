Mark your calendars, [World Plone Day](http://plone.org/events/wpd) is on April 28th. World Plone Day is a free, annual, international event designed to introduce the [Plone](http://plone.org) content management system to people outside of the Plone community. This year it is being held in 36 locations in 29 countries. The agenda usually contains a balance of business and technical topics. I just had a look at the [Boston World Plone Day agenda](http://bostonworldploneday2010-seth.eventbrite.com/) and it looks particularly good.  

If you have not looked at Plone recently, you should. With the official release of version 4.0 right around the corner, a lot of changes have happened. The architecture leverages more of the new Zope 3 technologies, performance has improved, and development techniques have evolved. A considerable amount of work is being done to make theming easier using tools like [Deliverance](http://jazkarta.com/services/training/deliverance-training). Also, the [NoSQL movement](http://nosql-database.org/) hype may make the underlying object database (ZODB) less intimidating to architects. From a user perspective, the team has focused on some subtle improvements such as switching the default rich text editor to TinyMCE and creating a new default theme.
