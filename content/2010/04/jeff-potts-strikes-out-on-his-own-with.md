My friend and former [Optaros](http://www.optaros.com) colleague Jeff Potts [recently announced that he has left Optaros to form a new company called Metaversant](http://ecmarchitect.com/archives/2010/04/22/1153). Jeff was Optaros' superstar [Alfresco](http://www.alfresco.com) guy. He put Optaros on the Alfresco map and [contributed to the Alfresco community](http://www.contenthere.net/2008/02/jeff-potts-alfresco-contributor-of-the-year.html) by writing a great book ([The Alfresco Developer Guide](http://www.contenthere.net/2008/12/review-alfresco-developer-guide.html)), maintaining useful information on his [blog](http://ecmarchitect.com), and also publicly pushing Alfresco in the right direction. Jeff is a charter member of my informal "Content Here Information Partner (CHIPs)" network and I have regular briefings with him to keep up to date on all things Alfresco.

  

Since Optaros has shifted its strategy to focus on the intersection of community, commerce, and content, Alfresco's position as a core offering has diminished. Alfresco is more oriented toward file-based collaboration, intranets, and digital asset management than social publishing and commerce. Metaversant will focus on training and advising Alfresco customers. I admire Jeff's expertise in and passion and I know that he will be successful in this new venture. He will certainly get referrals from me.
