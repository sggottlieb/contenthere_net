There has been a lot of Twitter chatter about this [New York Times article on offshore captcha circumvention.](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/26/technology/26captcha.html) The article describes how link spammers are hiring cheap offshore labor to manually solve captchas and dump comment spam on websites. If you use captcha as the only way to prevent comment spam, you should worry. However, if you are like me and use captcha only to level the playing field (by taking robots out of the equation), this is not a problem. In fact, I am happy that it raises the cost of link spamming and safe jobs are going to people that need them. 

If you are manual link spammer, don't accept less than a penny a comment. You deserve it!
