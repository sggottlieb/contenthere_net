Jeff Cram started blog series called [post launch paradigm](http://www.cmsmyth.com/2010/05/the-post-launch-paradigm/) with a great post called "[Your website is not a project](http://www.cmsmyth.com/2010/06/your-website-is-not-a-project)." The article lists all the ways companies fail when they think of a website as a project to be completed.  

If a website is not a project, what is it? Jeff calls it an "ongoing process." I call it a "product." [Website product management](http://www.contenthere.net/2010/05/tips-for-web-product-management.html) is becoming an increasingly important service offering for Content Here and it is a natural extension of the selection work that I have been doing over the first three years of the company. During a selection engagement I create a road map of functionality to be implemented over time and [set expectations](http://www.contenthere.net/2009/08/dimensions-of-success-or-ways-to-fail.html) for [user adoption](http://www.contenthere.net/2010/02/the-myth-of-the-occasional-cms-user.html) and [incremental improvement](http://www.contenthere.net/2009/07/you-bought-a-web-page-factory-not-a-webmaster-android.html). Recently selection clients have been engaging Content Here after implementation to help them progress along that road map. This feels great on a number of levels: these clients realize that their websites are not projects, they have bought in to the concept of continuous improvement, and I get to see the clients working with the products that they have selected. I even get to go through code once in a while!
