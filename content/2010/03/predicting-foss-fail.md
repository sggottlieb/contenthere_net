[The Open Source Way](https://www.theopensourceway.org/wiki/Main_Page) is a great resource for developers who want to start their own open source project. It is a wiki of lessons learned and best practices gathered primarily from experiences working on the RedHat and Fedora projects. One page that I find particularly interesting is "[How to tell if a FLOSS project is doomed to FAIL](https://www.theopensourceway.org/wiki/How_to_tell_if_a_FLOSS_project_is_doomed_to_FAIL)." The format assigns "fail points" for common (and uncommonly stupid) mistakes that project leads make. Making a few of these mistakes doesn't doom your project but making lots of them definitely stacks the odds against you.  

While it was written from the perspective of a Linux library developer, the list also contains useful information for other types of open source projects. I was hoping to add some content around project leadership but I was discouraged to see that I was not able to create an account or contribute to the discussion page (FAIL!). Here is what I would have added:

  

*   There is no road map showing planned improvements to the software  
    
*   The project leader(s) is(/are) not transparent about decisions \[ +5 points of fail \]  
    
*   There are no guidelines for contributing to the project \[ +20 points of fail \]  
    
*   The project does not have a way to attract and incorporate new contributors \[ +10 points of fail \]  
    
*   The project does not have a system for recognizing/rewarding contributions \[ +5 points of fail \]
