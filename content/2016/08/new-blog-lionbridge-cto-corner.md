I am writing about multilingual publishing on a new blog called "[CTO Corner](http://content.lionbridge.com/category/cto-corner/)."&nbsp;[This is a rich topic that many content management professionals never get exposed to](http://content.lionbridge.com/systems-integrator-needs-know-multilingual-publishing/). One of my hopes for this blog is to bring in experiences from others who are immersed in building and maintaining multilingual websites. Software vendor perspectives about managing multilingual content are welcome as well. If you would like to share,&nbsp;[@message me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/sggottlieb)&nbsp;and we can set up an interview.
