<span style="font-family: inherit;">In case you noticed something different, I moved this blog back onto the Blogger platform. Actually, Blogger is where Content Here started back in 2004 (Wow! A little over 11 years ago!). Over the intervening years, I converted the site to Wordpress and hosted it on a number of different providers. Some of the formatting shows that the posts are a little worse for wear. &nbsp;And I need to do some theming work. &nbsp;If you notice any other major problems, let me know.</span>  

<span style="font-family: inherit;">  
</span>
<span style="font-family: inherit;">Data ownership and control were the primary reasons for moving off of Blogger. W</span>hen my website was a core part of my consulting business,&nbsp;<span style="font-family: inherit;">$20.00 per month seemed worth it. Now that blogging is back to being a hobby and Google has a "</span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Takeout" style="font-family: inherit;">Data Liberation Policy</a><span style="font-family: inherit;">," Blogger makes more sense.&nbsp;</span>  

<span style="font-family: inherit;">  
</span>
<span style="font-family: inherit;">Moving from WordPress to Blogger definitely feels like going against the grain but this article "</span><a href="http://google.about.com/od/googleblogger/a/How-To-Move-Your-Blog-From-Wordpress-To-Blogger.htm" style="font-family: inherit;">How to Move Your Blog from WordPress to Blogger</a>"<span style="font-family: inherit;">&nbsp;gave excellent instructions plus a good explanation of why you would want to do it.</span>  

<span style="font-family: inherit;">  
</span>
<span style="font-family: inherit;">In addition to great utilities for both Blogger and Wordpress, one of the things that made migration easier was that I hosted all of my images and files on Flickr and other sites. &nbsp;That means that there was less to move.</span>  

<span style="font-family: inherit;">  
</span>
<span style="font-family: inherit;">My experience so far is that Blogger seems like a less cared for part of the Google ecosystem. &nbsp;It's clunky when compared to Wordpress or other web content management systems that I have used. I am sure that Google+ (and before that Google Wave) have consumed most of the attention. &nbsp;I can't imagine that Google would kill blogger, but if they do, there is always Google Takeout. &nbsp;</span>
