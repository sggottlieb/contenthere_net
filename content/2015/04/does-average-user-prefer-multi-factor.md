I was doing some anecdotal research about password security preferences and I was surprised to find that most of the people I talked to favored two-factor authentication (using Google Authenticator) over expiring passwords. My survey pool consisted of project managers who I think are pretty typical enterprise software users. Around half of them had not seen two-factor authentication until I showed it to them. The general attitude was that anything is better than expiring passwords â€” an opinion that I agree with.

Are my colleagues unusually geeky or is this a trend that other people are seeing as well? If you have experience, research, or intuition around this, I would love to hear from you. @reply me on Twitter: [@sggottlieb](https://twitter.com/sggottlieb) if you have something to say.
