I tend to be more aggressive than most when it comes to ending support for outdated browsers. As I mentioned in [this article about ending IE6 support 5 years ago](http://www.contenthere.net/2010/04/supporting-internet-explorer-6.html), supporting old browsers is not worth additional cost and drag on innovation.

I am happy whenever I see a big web property end support for an old browser, but I was absolutely thrilled to see that starting on [January 12th 2016, Microsoft will only support the most current version of Internet Explorer available for their supported operating systems](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/gp/microsoft-internet-explorer). This means:

*   IE8 and lower will be practically dead. It will only be supported on some embedded versions of Windows.
*   IE9 will only be supported on Windows Vista (remember Vista?), which will lose support on April 11, 2017.
*   IE10 will only be supported on older versions of Windows Server.

Even better, whenever Microsoft launches a new version of Internet Explorer, the older versions immediately lose support on mainstream desktops (and probably phones and tablets too).

Thanks Microsoft! It is a lot easier to stop supporting a browser if the software vendor behind it has also abandoned it.
