Fall conference season is just around the corner! Here are two events where I will be speaking:  

*   November 4th - 6th, 2008. I will be presenting [a number of sessions](http://jboye08.dk/speakers/seth_gottlieb) at [jboye08](http://jboye08.dk) in Aarhus, Denmark.   
    
*   December 2nd, 2008. I will be teaching a [workshop on selecting a CMS](http://gilbaneboston.com/pre-conference_workshops.html#workshop-a) at the Gilbane Conference in Boston.  
    

  

This spring Janus Boye, in conjunction with [Welchman Consulting](http://www.welchmanconsulting.com/), is launching a new U.S. peer to the Denmark "jboye" conference series. [jboye09](http://jboye09.com/) will take place in Philadelphia May 5th through May 7th. There is not much on the site yet but you can submit your email address to receive notifications.
