[Toby Ward](http://intranetblog.blogware.com) and the [Prescient Digital](http://www.prescientdigital.com) team is conducting an [Intranet 2.0 survey](http://www.zoomerang.com/Survey/survey.zgi?p=WEB227RVUZZBRC) to study the effectiveness of Intranet 2.0 tools and strategies.  Here is the blurb.

Targeted primarily to organizations that currently have a corporate intranet and/or portal, and are considering and/or have deployed Intranet 2.0 tools.

I am looking forward to seeing the results of this study.  From what I have seen personally, employee-oriented communities have failed to sustain the levels of social and collaborative energy that their consumer-oriented inspirations have achieved.  I would love to see what the market as a whole is doing.
