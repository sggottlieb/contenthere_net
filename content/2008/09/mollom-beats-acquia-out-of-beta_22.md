[Dries](http://buytaert.net) recently [announced](http://buytaert.net/mollom-out-of-beta) that his comment spam prevention service, [Mollom](http://mollom.com/), is out of Beta and is available to the world as a production grade service.  Nowadays, the word "Beta" doesn't mean too much because many of the services that we all use still sport the beta logo as if it were a "new and improved" label.  According to Dries' post, Mollom has already blocked 9 million spam messages.  That means lots of sites are running it and lots of bots are trying to spam them.    
  
In other Buytaert news, the private beta of [Acquia's](http://www.acquia.com) "hardened Drupal" has been extended.  I got a demo a few weeks ago and think this will be worth the wait if you are looking for a for a commercial-grade Drupal distribution.  Of course, much will depend on the level of support that this start-up is able to provide.
