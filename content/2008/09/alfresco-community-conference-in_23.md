[Alfresco](http://www.alfresco.com) recently announced that they will be holding a [Community Conference in Washington DC on October 9th, 2008](http://www.alfresco.com/about/events/2008/10/cc-us-1008/).  The European sister event will be in [Munich on October 16th.](http://www.alfresco.com/about/events/2008/10/cc-emea-1008/)  I heard great things about the joint [LifeRay/Alfresco event last summer](http://blog.contenthere.net/2007/06/alfesco-and-liferay-user-group.html) and I am happy that Alfresco is doing this.   
  
The one day session will include a presentation about the vision and strategy for the product, business case studies and technical demos, and an ask the expert panel discussion.  [Click here to register](http://www.alfresco.com/about/events/2008/10/cc-us-1008/register/).  It's free (as in beer).
