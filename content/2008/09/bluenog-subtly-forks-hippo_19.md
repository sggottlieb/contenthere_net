I was catching up on my blog reading and noticed a few [announcements](http://www.cmswire.com/cms/enterprise-cms/bluenog-launches-integrated-collaboration-environment-003149.php) about [Bluenog's](http://www.bluenog.com/) new integrated suite offering [ICE](http://bluenog.com/site/products).    I knew that Bluenog was a preferred US Hippo CMS integrator (before [Hippo opened a U.S. office](http://blog.contenthere.net/2008/03/one-hippo.html)) and it made me wonder if their platform was based on Hippo (despite the fact of not mentioning it).  Sure enough, Bluenog CMS is a direct fork of Hippo.  Hippo's permissive Apache 2.0 open source license allows this but I think that it is considered standard practice to at least mention where the code came from.  While the UI is most clearly Hippo with a simple logo swap, Hippo is mentioned nowhere in the literature.  It took some digging to find the [list of open software included in the full Bluenog ICE suite](http://www.bluenog.com/BluenogDependencies/).  The Bluenog product itself is not open source ([license](http://www.bluenog.com/clickwrapsla/)).  The  only downloads available are the compiled JARs and to get that, I needed to fill out a registration form.    
  
Meanwhile [Hippo B.V.,](http://www.onehippo.com/en/home) makers of Hippo CMS, continues their work on their [re-write of Hippo](http://docs.onehippo.org/hippo-ecm/).  While the wiki has not seen much change, there seems to be a steady flow of source code commits.
