I am just starting to get geared up for [jboye08](http://jboye08.dk/) next month.  The [conference program](http://jboye08.dk/program) is still being finalized but you can't go wrong with the great speakers that they have lined up.  So far, I am locked in to do a tutorial on open source and to participate in a panel on selecting a CMS.    
  
__Note to jboye delegates who are U.S. citizens:__ _You will be out of the country on election day so you should apply for an absentee ballot (unless you plan to vote for the wrong candidate)._  I just sent off for mine.  The site [Go Vote Absentee](http://www.govoteabsentee.org/index.php) made the process easy.
