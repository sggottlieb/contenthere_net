My report "Open Source Web Content Management in Java" is receiving enthusiastic praise.  Thanks [Sandro Groganz](http://sandro.groganz.com/), [Steven Noels](http://blogs.cocoondev.org/stevenn/steven.noels.html), and [James Robertson](http://www.steptwo.com.au/about/staff/jamesr/index.html) for the kind words.  I have posted some quotes [here](http://www.contenthere.net/products-page/reports/open-source-content-management-in-java#praise).  But don't just take their word for it.  Read it for yourself!
