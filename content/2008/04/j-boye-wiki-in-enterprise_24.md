Because of the inherent simplicity of the technology, wiki projects are less likely to fail in implementation than WCM or ECM projects.  However, many companies still struggle to get the desired value out of their wiki initiatives.  Purely managed and abandoned wikis have become yet another set of silos for information to hide in.    
  
Janus Boye and Dorthe Jespersen's new report _[Wiki in the Enterprise](http://eng.jboye.dk/research/wiki_in_the_enterprise)_  contains a very well conceived and written analysis of what it takes to successfully implement a corporate wikis.  Their research is based on interviews with enterprise wiki adopters and personal experience.  It covers:   

*   the positioning of wiki's in the content technology marketplace and the benefits that they promise  
    
*   real world experience the impact and challenges of adopting wikis  
    
*   recommendations for executing a wiki initiative

  
Their advice covers the cultural and organizational aspects of information management that are so often overlooked in technology-oriented projects.  If you are considering using a wiki to support collaboration or information management in your company, and rightly understand that success is not a matter of technology, you should definitely read this report.
