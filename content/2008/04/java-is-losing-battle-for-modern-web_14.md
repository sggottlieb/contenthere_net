There is a [hot dialog going over at The Server Side](http://www.theserverside.com) that starts with a [Fisking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisking) of ([PHP](http://www.php.net) co-author) Andi Gutman's blog post  ["Java is losing the battle for the modern Web. Can the JVM save the vendors?"](http://andigutmans.blogspot.com/2008/03/java-is-losing-battle-for-modern-web.html).  The basic premise of Andi's article is that, despite support for dynamic languages (Jython, JRuby, etc.), the JVM will have a hard time keeping up with the modern web's demands for flexibility, performance, and agility.    
  
As one would expect on [TSS](http://www.theserverside.com), the audience is definitely biased toward Java and there is a fair share of "PHP programmers can't code."  However, there are also plenty of well supported  arguments in the comments too - even a little bit of introspection.  No Springer-esque chair throwing but definitely worth a scan.
