A few weeks ago, [I wrote that I thought ISO adoption of Microsoft's OOXML was a good thing](http://blog.contenthere.net/2008/04/iso-adopts-ooxml-format-as.html) because a practical standard that everyone followed was more valuable than a noble standard that everyone ignored.  Well, it turns out that OOXML is actually the standard that no one follows.  As [Stephe Walli points out, Microsoft Office 2007 does not support OOXML](http://stephesblog.blogs.com/my_weblog/2008/04/microsoft-offic.html).  So what good is a standard that _no one_ supports?  No good at all.  At least [OpenDocument](http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=office) is [supported by multiple applications](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_applications_supporting_OpenDocument#Word_processors).  
  
But complex layout standards are a tricky business because it is difficult to write a complete and clear specification that covers so much detail.  Just look at the HTML standard and browser compatibility.  Joel Spolsky writes eloquently on that topic [here](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2008/03/17.html).  And HTML is designed to be much simpler than an office format.    
  
If the ultimate goal is to allow people with different software applications to collaborate on layout intensive documents, I don't know if we are ever going to get there.  As an experiment, I took a report written in [NeoOffice](http://www.neooffice.org/neojava/en/index.php) and opened it and saved it in Apple TextEdit (which claims ODF support).  When I re-opened the document in NeoOffice, much of the formatting was stripped out. I am still waiting for Lotus Symphony's promised Mac release.  That will be a better test of round-trip collaboration.    
  
My true hope is that less collaborative content development is done in documents and more through server based tools such as wikis.  I think the average knowledge worker is moving in that direction.   Tools like [Zoho Office](http://www.zoho.com/) and [Google Docs](http://docs.google.com) are helping here a great deal.  These tools allow the collaborative process to happen in a storage neutral way and then give options as to what format the content is published in (PDF, ODF, OOXML - or whatever MS Office really is).
