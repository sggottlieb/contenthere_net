Alfresco's [Dr. Yong Qu](http://drquyong.com/myblog/) has a [short but interesting article about using Alfresco Web Scripts to build an iPhone friendly web client for Alfresco](http://drquyong.com/myblog/?p=18).  You can see a [demo here](http://www.drquyong.com/iAlfresco.html) (turn down your speakers if you don't want to be cranking Kenny Loggins - you have been warned).  For a prototype, it nicely shows the power of Web Scripts but I wouldn't say that it captures the sexiness or efficiency of the iPhone UI.  I could see the core technology being very effective in the hands of an innovative designer.
