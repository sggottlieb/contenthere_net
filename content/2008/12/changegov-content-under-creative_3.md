[Change.gov](http://change.gov), President-Elect Obama's transition website is [licensing all of it's content under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0](http://change.gov/newsroom/entry/towards_a_21st_century_government/).  I think that is pretty cool but I was wondering who owns that content anyway.
