I regretted having to leave the [Gilbane](http://gilbaneboston.com) conference early because I missed seeing so many friends and colleagues but I had no idea I was missing this [FatWire gaff of showing the Playboy as their reference site](http://totalcio.blogs.techtarget.com/2008/12/03/fatwires-sex-site-demo-backfires-at-boston-web-20-conference/).  I am sure that demo would have been compelling to some audiences but it flew like a lead balloon at the Gilbane.  The worst part for [FatWire](http://www.fatwire.com) was when the [CEO](http://www.fatwire.com/cs/Satellite/Page/Main/Company/Company/Management) told an offended audience member that she was wrong to be offended.  I guess the age-old rule of presenting still holds:  know your audience.  You can see some [immediate reactions on Twitter](http://snurl.com/74399).
