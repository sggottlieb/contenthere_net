__EDIT__ [The Open Source Content Management in Java Report is now Free and on Scibd.](http://www.scribd.com/doc/77090148/Open-Source-Web-Content-Management-in-Java)  
  
Recently, a couple of the products that I covered in the Open Source Web Content Management in Java Report have had significant upgrades.  [Hippo CMS](http://www.hippocms.org) was totally re-written for version 7.0 and [Alfresco CMS](http://www.alfresco.com) advanced from 2.2 to 3.0.  Other projects have had smaller point releases.  I will soon start work on version 2.0 of the report but until I get it done, I will offer V1.0 at a discounted price of $350.  The individual [Hippo 6.0.5 evaluation](http://www.contenthere.net/products-page/reports/open-source-web-content-management-in-hippo) and [Alfresco 2.2 evaluation](http://www.contenthere.net/products-page/reports/open-source-content-management-in-alfresco) have been discounted to $50 each.

Also, you can now buy a report using the Discover Card - in case that was holding you back.
