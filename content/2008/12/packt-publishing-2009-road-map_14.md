[Packt Publishing](http://www.packtpub.com/) is looking to expand their already extensive library of open source books.  [Their recently published road map for 2009](http://www.packtpub.com/article/packt-invites-authors) includes eZ Publish Templates, Customizing Zope Sites, Apache Jackrabbit, Apache CXF, Openbravo, OpenEMM, Django e-commerce, Bazaar VCS, and Groovy dsl.  
  
If you know these technologies and are interested in writing a book, you should email Packt at [authors@packtpub.com](mailto:author@packtpub.com/).  From what I hear from the authors that I know, Packt is a good company to work with  and their royalties (roughly 11.25% of the cover price) are generous.  [Packt also contributes a significant amount of money to the projects themselves](http://www.packtpub.com/article/packt-donates-over-$100000-to-open-source-projects) through their [royalty scheme](http://www.packtpub.com/article/packt_open_source_project_royalty_scheme) and their annual [Open Source CMS Award](http://www.packtpub.com/award).
