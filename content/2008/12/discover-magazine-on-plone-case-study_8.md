The [Plone.net site](http://plone.net) has a very good case study on [Discover Magazine's migration to Plone](http://plone.net/case-studies/discover-magazine).  The [Discover Magazine site](http://discovermagazine.com/) looks like a model magazine site: clean, careful presentation; lots of imagery and multi-media; registration only content; and synergy with the print edition.  The article covers how [Plone](http://plone.org) is used to manage content, user adoption, performance, integration with 3rd party applications, and content migration.  It's a very worthy read if you are considering Plone for your news or magazine site.  
  
I am also encouraged to see that the [Plone.net](https://plone.net) site (which is targeted to business users) is filling up with content.  There are [34 case studies](http://plone.net/case-studies) and the [Plone sites directory](http://plone.net/sites) contains 1,442 entries.  I know that this was a key strategy to achieve the goal of increasing awareness about Plone and it is impressive to see the progress they have made.
