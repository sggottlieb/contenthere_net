Apologies for the totally misused Johnny Cash reference but Austin Smith has an excellent post on [how he came around from being a Drupal hater to a Drupal lover](http://www.inertweb.com/2008/12/21/how-i-learned-love-drupal).  Austin works on [Observer.com](http://www.observer.com) and [Politicker.com](http://www.politicker.com/) - two early, high profile [Drupal](http://drupal.org) sites.  Austin's background is primarily Java and PHP (written in the style of Java). He was at first put off by the object disoriented-ness of the Drupal programming model and the chaos that Drupal customization tends to attract.  What brought him around was the huge Drupal community and the realization that you could write clean code in Drupal.  He also has some great advice for developers having difficulty coming to terms with Drupal.
