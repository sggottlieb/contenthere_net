It looks like the much anticipated [version 3.0 of Alfresco Enterprise Edition](http://www.alfresco.com/products/wcm/) is out.  I have been looking forward to this release after seeing so much promise in the Community "lab" version.  I'm going to [register for a 30 day free trial](http://www.alfresco.com/community/registerent/?f=alfresco-enterprise-wcm-3.0.0.tar.gz) as soon as I get back from [Denmark](http://jboye08.dk).
