I was just catching up on some of the open source web content management platforms that I track and noticed the new [InfoGlue site](http://www.infoglue.org/).  Around a year and a half ago I had given up on InfoGlue because so little had happened.  Then I saw [Dang Huu Cu's cmf2007 presentation](http://cmf2007.dk/speakers/dang_huu_cu) on the United Nations Development Programme Vietnam's use of InfoGlue.  Still, very little was happening on the project at the time.   
  
While, I wouldn't say that InfoGlue is thriving, There appears to be some life in the project.  They put up a new release (2.9.3) in this September and the site looks much better.  They will be [holding an online conference on Monday October 13th](http://www.infoglue.org/News/News_detail/?contentId=1066).
