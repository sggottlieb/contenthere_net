I just read Boris Kraft's post on [losing the the Magnolia.info domain.](http://betterfasterbigger.blogspot.com/2008/10/losing-magnoliainfo.html)  I have had that happen to me (for a personal site) but never with these consequences.  If they can't get their domain back, they will move to magnolia-cms.com - which I think is a better domain anyway.  A .com or .org is easier to remember (says the guy with a .net domain).  
  
Best of luck to the Magnolia team in getting their website back and a reminder to everyone else that they should stay on top of their domain registration!
