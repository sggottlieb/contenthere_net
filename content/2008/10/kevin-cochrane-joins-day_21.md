I was just on the [Day Software](http://www.day.com) site and noticed that Kevin Cochrane (who had left [Interwoven](http://www.interwoven.com) to join [Alfresco](http://www.alfresco.com)) [joined Day as their Chief Marketing Officer](http://www.day.com/site/en/index/company/press_center/press_releases/day_accelerates_growth.html).  This seems like a great fit.  Kevin can contribute to Day's already very strong commercial open source strategy ([Day](http://www.day.com) is a primary contributor to [Apache JackRabbit](http://jackrabbit.apache.org/)) and will probably help Day build a U.S. presence.  Day's focus on web content management is much greater than Alfresco's so Kevin will probably enjoy more influence in the Day culture.  The big question is whether Kevin will bring with him some of his other Interwoven/Alfresco team.  Day already has a star-studded technology team and a [very strong, standards based content repository](http://www.day.com/content/site/en/index/solutions/content-centric_infrastructure/content_repository.html).    
  
I am looking forward to seeing Kevin's contributions at Day.
