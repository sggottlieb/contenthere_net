What is in a name? Well, if it is a really good name like [InitMarketing](http://www.initmarketing.com/ "InitMarketing"), I would say a very clever company. A while back I announced that [Sandro Groganz](http://sandro.groganz.com/weblog) was starting a new marketing company specializing in open source businesses. He didn't have a name at the time, which I thought was... well... curious (being a marketing company, after all). But I am glad he waited because InitMarketing is awesome on so many levels. No logo yet. They are holding a contest where the public submits their ideas. These two things should tell you that InitMarketing is not just another marketing organization.

  

The other great thing about InitMarketing is my friend and colleague [Stephe Walli](http://stephesblog.blogs.com) has joined the company. Stephe brings a wealth of knowledge about open source business and a great network. He is also a fun guy to work with.
