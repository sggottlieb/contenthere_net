Notes and action items from the [Plone Strategic Planning Summit](http://www.openplans.org/projects/plone-strategic-planning/project-home) were just [posted on the plone.org site.](http://plone.org/events/2008-summit/) The notes are still a little rough and only hint all the information that was shared and there is still work to do to organize and plan the execution of these ideas. Probably the most informative page is [the next steps email](http://www.nabble.com/Strategic-Planning-Summit%3A-Next-Steps-td15431896s6745.html) sent by [Alex](http://limi.net/). This email contains pointers to a [bunch of Trac tickets](http://dev.plone.org/plone/report/10). Every one of them has an owner (or "champion") to push them forward.
