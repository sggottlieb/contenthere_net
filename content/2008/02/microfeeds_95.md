__\[Correction: as you can see in the comments, John Eckman pointed out that pulseofoss is the work of [Raven Zachary](http://www.rinzai.com/) (451 Group) and [Michael Richardson](http://www.witigonen.com/) - not Optaros.\]__

  
  

I have been getting into [Twitter](http://twitter.com/) lately. At first I thought it was a waste of time but now I really like how less than 140 characters and a brief moment of attention can make you feel "up to date" with someone.

  

To give you an idea of how short 140 characters is, Twitter would have cut me off the previous paragraph after the word "feel." For some, 140 characters is enough to speak volumes. My former Optaros colleague [John Eckman](http://twitter.com/jeckman) has totally mastered the medium.

  

I also like how companies are starting to use Twitter as a low key publishing tool. [CMSWire](http://www.cmswire.com/) also has a [good feed](http://twitter.com/cmswire) pointing out news flashes and links to good articles. [Optaros](http://www.optaros.com/) just launched a feed called [pulseofoss.](http://twitter.com/pulseofoss)

  

Now I have yet another reason to buy a smart phone.
