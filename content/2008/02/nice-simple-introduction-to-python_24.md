I just read [Martin Aspeli's](http://martinaspeli.net/) [CIO Magazine](http://www.cio.com) article ["You Used Python to Write WHAT?"](http://www.cio.com/article/185350/You_Used_Python_to_Write_WHAT_/1) I, myself, wouldn't have dared to write an article about a programming language for a non-technical audience, but Martin actually pulled it off. The article nicely covers some of the history, core concepts, and uses of the Python language without succumbing into the temptation to get into the techy details - perfect to send to a CIO that just needs enough information to feel comfortable with the language. Nice job Martin!
