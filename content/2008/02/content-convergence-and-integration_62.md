I was just looking through the program for the [Content Convergence and Integration conference](http://convergence.confabb.com/conferences/cci2008) that is being held in Vancouver March 12th - 14th and I wish that I could be there. Not only is Vancouver a great city to visit, the sessions look very good. There are a number of talks on content re-use in a Web 2.0 world sound particularly interesting. If you are able to break away, I would seriously consider going.
