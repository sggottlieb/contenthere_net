I have been planning some trips for upcoming conferences.  Here is my schedule for the next couple of months.    

*   I will be an innocent bystander at [Drupalcon](http://boston2008.drupalcon.org/) next week in Boston (March 3-6).  
    
*   I will be in Cologne for [OpenCms Days](http://www.opencms-days.org/en/index.html) May 5th and 6th [to give a presentation on what all the other open source Java web CMS are doing](http://www.contenthere.net/products-page/reports/open-source-content-management-in-java).   
    
*   In June (17th and 18th), I will be in Chicago for [Web Content 2008](http://www.webcontent2008.com/) to present ["Will Your Next Web Platform Be Free?: A Guide to the Open Source Web Content Management Landscape"](http://www.webcontent2008.com/program_detail/web_content_management_deployment_patterns/)  
    
*   In November, I will be Aarhus, Denmark for [jboye08](http://www.jboye08.dk/).  
    

  
There are also some conferences that I would love to attend but will sadly miss.  In particular:  

*   [The Web Content Mavens](http://webcontentmavens.com/) of Washington, DC [are having a meetup](http://webcms.meetup.com/39/calendar/7089391/) tomorrow (February 27th) on open source web content management technologies. I can't be there but [Content Here](http://www.contenthere.net) is sponsoring. If you go, tell me how the pizza is ;)  
    
*   [South By Southwest Interactive](http://2008.sxsw.com/interactive/) in Austin March 7-11.  
    
*   [The Server Side Java Symposium in Las Vegas](http://javasymposium.techtarget.com/lasvegas/) March 26-28.   
    

  
  
I might try to make it to the [Web 2.0 Web Expo in NY](http://en.oreilly.com/webexny2008/public/content/home) September 16-18th.    
  
Anything else I should be thinking about?
