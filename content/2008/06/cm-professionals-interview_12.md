The June 2008 edition of the [CM Pros](http://www.cmpros.org) newsletter has a short interview with yours truly.  I was asked  

*   What were the drivers behind your latest report, "Open Source Web Content Management in Java?"  
    
*   You have published numerous reports addressing the intelligent selection of content management solutions. In your opinion, what is the biggest mistake that enterprises make when trying to identify and select a solution?  
    
*   Based on current trends in content management strategies, where do you see this ever-growing and ever-changing field headed over the next five years?
