Sacha Chua, whose [blog](http://sachachua.com/wp/)&nbsp;keeps me hopeful that smart and creative people can thrive in [huge](http://www.ibm.com) companies not called "[Google](http://www.google.com/)", has [started to play with](http://sachachua.com/wp/2008/06/01/drupal-lather-rinse-repeat-cleaner-development-with-installation-profiles-and-makefiles/) [Drupal](http://drupal.org/). &nbsp;I like how she starts by addressing the configuration management problem. &nbsp; Her method is to have a script that blows away everything and then reloads from an [installation profile](http://drupal.org/project/install_profile_api) (note, like many Drupal modules, the Profile Wizard module is not available yet for 6.x.  However, many of the features should be included in the Drupal 7 core). &nbsp;Most people wait to tackle configuration management after it is too late. &nbsp;

<div>Sacha is just getting started with Drupal. &nbsp;We will have to see if she moves her blog off of <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>.</div>
