[Steve Ballmer predicts the end of printed media in 10 years](http://gizmodo.com/5013835/ballmer-predicts-death-of-printed-media).  "there will be no media consumption left in 10 years that is not delivered over an IP network."  I guess you wind up saying things like that when you force yourself to repeat "I will not underestimate the Internet" 100 times a day.  
  
If this is true, I wonder if that will lead to better (portable and stationary) electronic displays or a huge jump in the home printer business.  
  
On the content production side, I wonder if content will still initially  be produced for a print format (creating print-ready PDF using InDesign/K4) or in more presentation neutral contribution environment (like classic the web content management model).
