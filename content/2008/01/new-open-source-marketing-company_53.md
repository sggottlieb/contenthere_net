[Sandro Groganz](http://sandro.groganz.com/) just announced on [his blog](http://sandro.groganz.com/weblog/) the formation of his new [open source marketing](http://sandro.groganz.com/wiki/Category:Open_Source_Marketing) company. His target market includes commercial open source vendors, third party contributors, and investors in open source technology. All three of these groups could definitely use Sandro's help. He is still working on a name for the company and if you have any ideas, please send them to Sandro (what an open source way to start a company!).

If you don't already know Sandro, he was an VP of Communications at [eZ systems](http://ez.no/) and recently worked as the VP of Marketing at MindQuarry. Sandro knows the nuances of open source based business as well as anyone that I know.

Best of luck Sandro!
