After over 3 years since its last major release, the Apache Lenya team [just announced the official release of version 2.0](http://www.apachenews.org/archives/001098.html). [There is one known live site running 2.0](http://koerperarbeit-zeche-ludwig.de/index_en.html) that was built off of the unreleased 2.0 trunk by one of the committers.

  

2.0 was originally slated to be called 1.4 but the release got so big that they renamed it to 2.0 (I talked about it [here](http://contenthere.blogspot.com/2007/06/tale-of-two-releases.html)). Even though this is a major release that took a lot of work, most of the big changes are under the covers and are not visible to the content contributor. Hopefully these architectural improvements, plus fresh blood on the development team ( a few new committers have recently been voted in), will be a launching point for further progress on the project.
