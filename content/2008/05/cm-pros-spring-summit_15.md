I am looking over the [program for the CM Professionals Spring 2008 Summit](http://summit.cmpros.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=Page.viewPage&amp;pageId=624) (June 17th in San Francisco) and am really impressed with the lineup. This event seems to get better every year.    
  
The topic is "Dynamic Delivery Across Multiple Media Channels" and there is  also a healthy dose of web 2.0 and social media content.  The one day event is broken up into two tracks (business and technical) and attendees will need to make some hard choices.  For example, do you see [Christine Pierpoint](http://www.welchmanconsulting.com/christine.htm) describing [governance in a Web 2.0 world](http://summit.cmpros.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=Page.ViewPage&amp;PageID=625#1a) or [Michael Wechner](http://www.wyona.com/people/michael-wechner/index.html) talking about [integrating Open Social](http://summit.cmpros.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=Page.ViewPage&amp;PageID=625#1b)?    
  
Either way, you can't go wrong.  Plus, it only costs $395 to [register](http://summit.cmpros.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=Page.viewPage&amp;pageId=626).  $1,795 gets you into the [Gilbane Conference](http://gilbanesf.com/registration_information.html) (always a fun event) and an [iPod Touch](http://www.apple.com/ipodtouch/) as well.
