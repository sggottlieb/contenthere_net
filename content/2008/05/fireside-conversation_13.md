<p class="flickr-yourcomment"> <strong>[Update: Steven posted <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/stevenn/fireside-chat-i-open-source-cms">slides from the facilitated discussions</a> on slideshare]</strong><br/><br/>Thank you <a href="http://www.outerthought.com">Outerthought</a> for all the kind hospitality and for hosting the first <a href="http://outerthought.org/en/events/oscmsfschat.html">fireside conversation</a>.  The event was a great success (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/stevenn/sets/72157604964982157/">pictures</a>) with a fantastic audience and thoughtful participation during the facilitated discussions.  I have a feeling that there will be more events like these so be sure to register for the next one!</p>
