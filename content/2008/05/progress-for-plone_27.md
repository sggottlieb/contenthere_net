Donna "Snow Write" Snow has an update on the [Aftermath](http://snowwrites.com/2008/05/25/the-summit-aftermath-psps/) of the [2008 Plone Strategic Planning Summit](http://www.openplans.org/projects/plone-strategic-planning/project-home) ([my notes from the event](http://blog.contenthere.net/2008/02/plone-strategic-planning-session.html)).  Donna is an early user and (one could say) matriarch of the Plone community (her analogy of Plone as a teenager certainly strengthens the case there).  I like her description of [GloWorm](http://weblion.psu.edu/blog/esteele/gloworm-0-1-alpha1-now-available/view) and other tools to soften the adjustment to Plone's new [Zope 3](http://www.zope.org/Products/Zope3) oriented architecture.
