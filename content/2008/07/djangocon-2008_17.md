The [Django](http://www.djangoproject.com) community recently announced the first official Django conference. [DjangoCon 2008](http://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2008/jul/13/djangocon/) will be held at Google's Mountain View headquarters on September 6th and 7th to coincide with release 1.0 of the platform.  Admission is free (as in beer) but they are capping the attendance at 200.    
  
If you are new to Django, Django is am open source web application development framework written in the [Python](http://www.python.org/) programming Language.  Despite its sub-1.0 status, Django is quite mature.  It was first developed by the folks over at Lawrence Journal-World for sites like [ljworld.com](http://www2.ljworld.com/), [lawrence.com](http://lawrence.com/), and [KUSports.com](http://www2.kusports.com/).  Later, [Rob Curley](http://www.robcurley.com/) assembled a team over at the [Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/) to build a bunch of local sites.  Now Django is bundled and actively used in [Google App Engine](http://code.google.com/appengine/).  There area also a number of books on Django.  I am currently reading the [Definitive Guide to Django](http://www.amazon.com/Definitive-Guide-Django-Development-Right/dp/1590597257/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1216348078&amp;sr=8-1) by Adrian Holovaty and Jacob Kaplan-Moss.  So far, so good.  I see a lot in common with [Rails](http://www.rubyonrails.org/) and the two definitely seem to get along at least at a philosophical level.

I will be covering Django in an upcoming report about web content management in media and publishing because of Django's widespread use in that industry.  There is a small commercial CMS called [Ellington](http://www.ellingtoncms.com/) that is specifically designed for the newsroom.  Do you have any experience with Django or Ellington? I would love to talk to you about it.
