The [Google](http://www.google.com)  
 blog [posted that they passed the 1 Trillion pages milestone](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/07/we-knew-web-was-big.html).  They go on to say that the web is actually infinite thanks to websites like online calendars with "next" buttons that go into the future indefinitely.  It makes my little corner of the web feel even smaller than usual.  Even "billions and billions" seems small.    
  
I remember hearing somewhere that Google is better positioned than anyone to handle large volumes of pages because their indices use a unique proprietary database and storage technology that can scale far beyond traditional relational databases.  It looks like they are going to need it.
