This summer I have had a crazy travel schedule so I was not able to attend the [OSCON](http://en.oreilly.com/oscon2008/public/content/home) conference in Portland.  I really need to get out there one of these days.  Fortunately, the [O'Reilly bloggers](http://en.oreilly.com/oscon2008/public/content/news-coverage) and [Matt Raible](http://raibledesigns.com/rd/entry/oscon_2008_wrapup) have great notes from the conference. The speaker [presentations](http://en.oreilly.com/oscon2008/public/schedule/proceedings) are posted on the [OSCON site](http://en.oreilly.com/oscon2008/public/content/home) and the [keynotes are supposed to be available on BlipTV](http://oscon.blip.tv) but I just checked and they don't seem to be there yet.  While "virtually" attending a conference doesn't provide all the social and interactive benefits of physically being there, it is better than nothing.
