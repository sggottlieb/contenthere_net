Four years ago today I started Enter Content Here with [a post defining content management](http://blog.contenthere.net/2004/11/content-management-definition.html).  The post focused on _what was being managed_ and how to differentiate that from other types of data.  Over the past years this blog has reported and explored lots of ideas but content (or, as [Bob Boiko](http://www.metatorial.com/) would say "Information") has always remained in the center of it all.  I am still interested [what distinguishes content from other data](http://blog.contenthere.net/2008/05/content-is-not-data.html) but I think the focus needs to shift to the  "management" end of the phrase "content management."  
  
I like the saying "content management is a verb not a product" because it emphasizes the effort and process required to effectively create and use information.  However, there are better verbs to describe this effort than "management" - a vague word that often connotes what we do with undesirable things like risk, waste, and stress.  Content is an asset, not a liability (unless you are getting sued and you need to pay lawyers to read it), and working with it should be described in more positive and active language: communicating, creating, educating, publishing, collaborating, connecting, etc.    
  
There is still much more to write about the processes and technologies that people use to release value from information.  It has been four years and I feel like I am just getting started.
