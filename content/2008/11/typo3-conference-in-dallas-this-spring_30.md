One of the barriers to select [TYPO3](http://typo3.org/) in North America has been the dearth of developers and systems integrators that know the platform.  This is in stark contrast to Germany where many consultancies and agencies are quite prolific with TYPO3.  In fact, TYPO3 has even has its own German print magazine [T3N](http://t3n.yeebase.com/).    
  
So you could imagine my surprise when I found that there will be a [T3Con in Dallas (as in Texas) this Spring](http://t3con09-dallas.typo3.org/home.html).  Details are still sparse and the lone organizer appears to be the German TYPO3 specialist [punkt](http://www.punkt.de) (whose website is in German only).  If you know anything more about this event, please let me know.  I am intrigued.
