Both the [New York Times](http://nytimes.com) and the [Telegraph](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/)  have been innovating on the newsmedia business model by introducing API's that expose their content and services for outside developers to leverage.  Recently [The Guardian](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/) held [their "Hack Day at The Guardian"](http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/insideguardian/2008/nov/13/guardian-hack-day).    
  
To quote:  
>  The concept is simple: take an idea to prototype in a day and then present your work to your colleagues and a panel of judges.  
Guardian staff and friends participated in this 24 hour code-fest that ended in 90 second presentations in front of a panel.  You can track activity on [Twitter](http://search.twitter.com/search?max_id=1009571987&amp;page=1&amp;q=+%23ghack1) and see pictures on [Flickr](http://flickr.com/search/groups/?q=ghack1&amp;m=pool&amp;s=int&amp;w=918228%40N20&amp;z=t).  I still don't know who won yet.  I am sure that everyone is a winner :)
