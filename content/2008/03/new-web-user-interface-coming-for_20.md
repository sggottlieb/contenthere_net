If you have been disappointed with [Alfresco](http://www.alfresco.com)'s web content management user interface, you should see what is happening in the Community Edition (2.9 - an R&amp;D release).  In particular, there is an extension called [Alfresco Dynamic Website](http://wiki.alfresco.com/wiki/Alfresco_Dynamic_Website) that seems to provide a much better UI for managing web projects.  I have not started playing with it but it looks promising.

With this extension, Alfresco WCM gets a much needed tree control to browse and organize a website and in-context editing.  BTW, how did Alfresco know to win me over by having an enviro-demo?  I wonder if this work was somehow tied into their [recent Synerge win](http://www.alfresco.com/media/releases/2008/03/synerge/).  
  
[According to the forum](http://forums.alfresco.com/viewtopic.php?f=29&amp;t=11238), at least some of these concepts will start to be available for Community Edition 2.9 by mid April (although, since 2.2 Enterprise is late, I am not holding my breath).  The feature will be baked into Community Edition 3.0 scheduled for late July.  The 3.0 is aptly named "Project Slingshot" - I think that Alfresco could afford to shoot ahead in WCM usability.
