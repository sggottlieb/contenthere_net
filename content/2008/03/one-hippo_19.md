When I wrote the [Hippo CMS](http://www.hippocms.org) [evaluation](http://www.contenthere.net/products-page/reports/open-source-web-content-management-in-hippo) for [Open Source Web Content Management in Java](http://www.contenthere.net/products-page/reports/open-source-content-management-in-java), I noted that Hippo really had no presence in North America yet but they were poised to enter the market.  Well, [it's happening](http://blogs.zdnet.com/open-source/?p=2119).  Hippo BV bought David Sean Taylor's (of [Apache Jetspeed](http://portals.apache.org/jetspeed-2/) fame) company [Blue Sunrise](http://www.onehippo.com/en/about_us/bluesunrise).  David is now the VP of Engineering and gives Hippo a presence on the West Coast (Bay Area).    
  
I don't know of any North American customers running on Hippo CMS yet.  But I wouldn't be surprised if Blue Sunrise customers running on Jetspeed start to move toward [Hippo Portal](http://www.onehippo.com/en/products,hippo-portal), which is based on Jetspeed.  
  
Hippo BV also relaunched their website under a .com address: [www.onehippo.com](http://www.onehippo.com).  When browsing the website I noticed some commas in the URLs that made me suspect that they are running on the upcoming [Hippo ECM 1.0](http://www.hippocms.org/display/HIPPOECM/Home) platform (a developer release is due out in April).  When I asked CTO [Arj√© Cahn](http://blogs.hippo.nl/arje/) about it, he told me that they are running the site on [Vignette](http://www.vignette.com).  I hope their North American expansion doesn't make them lose their Dutch sense of humor.
