Via [CMSWire](http://www.cmswire.com/cms/enterprise-cms/swiss-cms-vendor-day-launches-developer-portal-and-blog-002450.php) (because I missed the press release in my in-box - sorry Patrick).  
  
[Day Software](http://www.day.com) recently launched a new [blog and developer portal](http://dev.day.com).  The intent of the portal is to be for content management experts, by content management experts and focus on content technology standards.  Day definitely has the horsepower to produce good content with on-staff visionaries like David Nuescheler (the driving force behind [JSR 170](http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=170)), [Roy "the REST man" Fielding](http://roy.gbiv.com/), and collaboration and open source expert [Lars Trieloff](http://weblogs.goshaky.com/weblogs/lars/).  
  
Color me subscribed!   
  
BTW, I just noticed from the RSS feed that the title is "(content goes here) blog." What's up with that?
