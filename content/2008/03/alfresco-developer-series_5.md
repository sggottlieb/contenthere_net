I was just reading Jeff Pott's [Alfresco](http://www.alfresco.com) article "[Working with Custom Content Types](http://ecmarchitect.com/images/articles/alfresco-content/content-article.pdf)" and it is one of the best developer guides on Alfresco that I have read.  The article goes through the creation of content types in a step by step narrative with some pointers to other interesting facts along the way.  Jeff is hosting a [whole series of these articles on his website](http://ecmarchitect.com/alfresco-developer-series/). [The Web Scripts introduction](http://ecmarchitect.com/images/articles/alfresco-webscripts/web-script-article.pdf) is also very good.    
  
For a vendor neutral analysis of Alfresco's general utility in web content management, I am offering my Alfresco evaluation from [Open Source Web Content Management in Java](http://www.contenthere.net/products-page/reports/open-source-content-management-in-java) as a [stand-alone report](http://www.contenthere.net/products-page/reports/open-source-content-management-in-alfresco). The report covers Enterprise Edition version 2.2, which is due out any day now.
