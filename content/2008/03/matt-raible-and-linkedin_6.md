[Matt Raible](http://raibledesigns.com) has an [interesting post about some framework evaluation work](http://raibledesigns.com/rd/entry/the_linkedin_journey_continues) that he did for [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/).  During the project, Matt helped LinkedIn address the issues of framework proliferation and the maintenance of a proprietary framework.  [Spring MVC](http://www.springframework.org/) and [Struts2](http://struts.apache.org/2.x/) were considered but neither of them solved the problem of a long development/deployment cycle: it takes a lot of time to change and run code.    
  
There is also nice mention of [Rails](http://www.rubyonrails.org/) vs. [Grails](http://grails.codehaus.org/).  But the biggest news was buried in the middle of the post.  Matt is joining LinkedIn as a full time employee.    
  
>  A few days later, I was pulled into the CTO's office and he offered me the job. He offered me the challenge of building this team and told me I could do it remotely (from Denver) and hire my own people to help me with it. I gulped as I realized I'd just been offered the opportunity of a lifetime.  
  
Matt is going to head up the UI Frameworks team and he is [hiring](http://www.linkedin.com/jobs?viewJob=&amp;jobId=483817&amp;fromSearch=39&amp;sik=1204111006804).
