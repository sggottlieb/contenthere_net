The [OpenCms Days 2008 Website](http://www.opencms-days.org) is filling up with information.  The [speakers list](http://www.opencms-days.org/en/speakers/) and  [program](http://www.opencms-days.org/en/program/) have been finalized.  My [presentation](http://www.opencms-days.org/en/program/sessions/b5.html) is scheduled for the first business session of the second day.  I am looking forward to it!     
  
(I guess that could have been a [tweet](http://twitter.com/sggottlieb) but what the heck.)
