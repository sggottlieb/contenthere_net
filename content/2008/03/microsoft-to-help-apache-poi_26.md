[Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com) and open source integrator [Sourcesense](http://www.sourcesense.com/en/home) recently [announced a partnership](http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2008/mar08/03-25SourcesensePR.mspx).  One of the areas that they will be collaborating is on the [Apache POI](http://poi.apache.org/) project.  For those who are not familiar with POI, it is used by several CMS (and other applications) to transform Microsoft Office file formats into indexable text and other neutral formats like PDF.  POI has not kept up with the latest Office 2007 formats so this is good news for CMS like [Jahia](http://www.jahia.org).    
  
[OpenOffice](http://www.openoffice.org/) is also used as a server side library for MS Office file transformation.  Interestingly, POI doesn't support OpenOffice and the OpenDocument format very well.  Hmmm...
