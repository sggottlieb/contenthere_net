    <title>ISO adopts OOXML format as international standard</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://www.cmswire.com"&gt;CMSWire's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.cmswire.com/about/"&gt;Brice Dunwoodie&lt;/a&gt; passed me this &lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/08/04/01/ISO-adopts-OOXML-format-as-international-standard_1.html"&gt;InfoWorld article about ISO's adoption of OOXML&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contrary to what you would expect from me, I actually think this is a good thing.  &lt;a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/default.aspx"&gt;Microsoft Office&lt;/a&gt; is the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_facto"&gt;de facto&lt;/a&gt; standard.  Being a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_jure"&gt;de jure&lt;/a&gt;, official standard doesn't help &lt;a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=office"&gt;OpenDocument&lt;/a&gt; if when you send an open document file to anyone they say that they can't open it.  Ideally, Microsoft would have adopted OpenDocument but that wasn't to happen.  The next best thing is for MS to adhere to their &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Open_XML"&gt;OOXML&lt;/a&gt; standard and alternative office suites support it.   That Microsoft originated the standard doesn't mean that they will be the only one to benefit from it going forward.  Just look at &lt;a href="http://www.sun.com"&gt;Sun&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.java.com/en/"&gt;Java&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I don't think the world loses with this move, &lt;a href="http://www.openoffice.org"&gt;OpenOffice&lt;/a&gt; (Sun in particular) and &lt;a href="http://www.oasis-open.org"&gt;OASIS&lt;/a&gt; certainly took blows.  OpenOffice can quickly recover by building in support for OOXML.  The format should be easier to support than having to reverse engineer prior Microsoft formats.  OASIS gets injured because it shows the limitation of de jure standard against a de facto standard.</content>

    <title>What makes a sexy demo</title>
    <content type='html'>I am finally going over my &lt;a href="http://jboye08.dk"&gt;jboye08&lt;/a&gt; notes and I found my scribbles from the &lt;a href="http://jboye08.dk/web_idol"&gt;Web Idol competition&lt;/a&gt;.  For those of you who are unfamiliar with this event, each vendor gets seven minutes to demonstrate their product.  "Celebrity" judges put in their quips (Ã¡ la American Idol) and the audience votes on what product they like the most.  In addition to being entertaining, the event gives insight into what the vendors think are their coolest features (they can't show everything in 7 minutes) and what the audience responds to.  Here is what the vendors demonstrated this year (in order of their appearance).  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sitecore.com"&gt;Sitecore&lt;/a&gt; showed:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;incontext editing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;their "site builder" functionality&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;multi-device preview&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;their ribbon tool bars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;building a slide show&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.tridion.com"&gt;SDL Tridion&lt;/a&gt; showed:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;incontext editing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;integrating translation into workflow&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;emailing groups&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;a Forester chart&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.hippocms.org"&gt;Hippo&lt;/a&gt; showed:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;dashboard plugins&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;drag and drop WYSIWYG control (e.g. dragging a URL onto a piece of text to create a link)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;associating content&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://ez.no"&gt;eZ Systems&lt;/a&gt; showed:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;contributing content from MS Word&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;browse to edit&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;creating a picture gallery&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;community rating&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.e-spirit.co.uk/"&gt;e-Spirit&lt;/a&gt; showed:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;database integration through the administrative UI&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This year Sitecore won first place and Hippo came in second.  Interestingly, reigning champion eZ Systems did not show all the video functionality which helped them win last year.  The audience seemed to be the most attracted to clean user interfaces that looked simple to use.  Advanced functionality like sophisticated workflow and database integration were less compelling.  While an event like Web Idol does not translate into a software selection, I think this result reenforces the importance of simplicity and ease of use in a demo.  Power, range, and flexibility gets a product onto a short list but simplicity is what business users find sexy (at least as far as software demos go).  If you are running a CMS selection, this means that you need to make sure that all of the products that demo to your selection team meet your core functional and non-functional requirements.</content>

    <title>Powerpoint as the Deliverable</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;object width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/cagxPlVqrtM&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/cagxPlVqrtM&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Increasingly, I am finding that clients prefer a slide deck (i.e. MS Powerpoint) as a deliverable rather than a regular document.  The reality is that many people don't really read documents and would rather their consultants not waste the time writing words that will not be read.  As a consultant, I usually find myself having mixed feelings.  On the one hand, I don't like the idea of typing prose into a vacuum (and contribute to the tangle of content that they may have hired me to solve).  On the other hand, at the end of the project, I normally have a lot to say and it is difficult to squeeze all this information into a slide deck that can be left behind and stand on its own.  The resulting product tends to look like an epic novel is coffee-table book format - or like the slides in this You Tube clip.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Slides were meant to &lt;em&gt;accompany&lt;/em&gt; a presentation and the best presenters only use them for visual cues to complement what they say.  Slides written in this philosophy leave too much to interpretation without the presenters explanation.  When my deliverable is a slide presentation I get around this limitation by packing a lot of explanation in the speakers notes.  Recently, I have gone so far as to make foot notes in the slide that reference points I make in the speakers notes.  The result is this strange hybrid that I am not quite sure how to characterize.  It is essentially a document-like narrative organized around bold themes.  People can just browse through the themes and drill into topics that are of interest.  However, I suspect that few readers actually do this. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sites like &lt;a href="http://www.slideshare.com"&gt;SlideShare&lt;/a&gt; ask slides  to stand on their own and, therefore, seem to favor wordy slides.  The ones with just pictures leave the reader in the dark imagining what the presentation must have been about.  I have felt the compulsion to write presentation slides for a SlideShare reader and wonder if other presenters think this way too. In the extreme, I could see a presentation turn into a group reading of paragraphs of narrative.  I hope that it does not come to that.</content>

    <title>Content Management and Internationalization</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.cmprofessionals.org/events/summit/fall2006/"&gt;Fall CM Professionals Summit&lt;/a&gt; is going to be great this year.  We are doing a much better job of early planning and advanced marketing thanks to the tireless efforts of &lt;a href="http://thecontentwrangler.com/"&gt;Scott Abel&lt;/a&gt; and we have a great topic: Internationalization.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don't know about you but it feels like localization is more important than back in the Web 1.0 days.  Maybe this is related to the &lt;a href="http://www.cluetrain.com/"&gt;Clue Train Manifisto's&lt;/a&gt; assertion that markets are conversations and language mismatches are more obvious in conversations than one way broadcasts.  It could be the trend towards globalization.  It could be that the rest of the world is tired of putting up with a U.S. dominated Internet.  Whatever the driving force is, localization is no longer that road-kill requirement that gets cut out of scope on the first round. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, much of my work has had localization aspects - either the whole site needed to be translated into multiple langauges or the client wants to make certain content available in different languages.  There is also the question of how autonomous the localized subsites are.  Different levels of localization suggest different architectures and management processes.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am considering having a round table at the Summit to discuss a system for classifying levels of localization. Something like &lt;a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/full-checklist.html"&gt;WCAG levels for accessibility&lt;/a&gt;.  Just like with the accessibility standards, companies need to make trade-offs based on audience need and cost in deciding what level to pursue.  Does anyone else think this would be an interesting idea?  If you think this is interesting or stupid, put up a comment or send me an email.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Pragmatic Thinking and Learning vs. Knowledge Management</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;While reading Andy Hunt's excellent book &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1934356050?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=contenthere-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1934356050"&gt;Pragmatic Thinking &amp;amp; Learning: Refactor Your Wetware&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=contenthere-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1934356050" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /&gt; I couldn't help but return to a conclusion that I reached long ago: "knowledge management," as an enterprise practice and class of software, is a false promise.  Furthermore, traditional corporate training programs are doomed to failure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was first struck by this realization around ten years ago when I was working on a project for a department of the federal government.  The premise of the project was to "capture the knowledge" from a generation of experienced staff that were on the cusp of retirement.  This department was structured so that knowledge was concentrated in minority of senior employees.  Underneath them there was a thin layer of mid-level staff; then a large group of juniors.  The strategy was to video pre-retirees reminiscing about their experiences and the department could somehow do something with that "knowledge."  The idea was dead on arrival and the prime contractor (that originally pitched it) knew it. I remember suggesting an alternative strategy of setting up an apprentice program where people could learn by &lt;em&gt;doing&lt;/em&gt; rather than watching TV; but I was laughed out of the room. They had no interest in "capturing knowledge." Their primary business was hiring retirees and staffing them as consultants at the department. Failure was more profitable than success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ever since that experience, I have been keenly interested in the process of learning.  As a technologist and a consultant, I am always learning so I have developed tactics that work for me.  What surprised me in reading Pragmatic Thinking &amp;amp; Learning is that there is actual scientific theory that supports many of the tactics that I employ. What I like most about the book is that it talks about thinking and learning as a personal process that you have to do yourself.  The most a teacher or a computer can do for you is provide information &amp;mdash; data. To turn that information into knowledge, you have to internalize it into something that is meaningful to you. You need to put the information into context with other things you know.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most corporate professional development programs ignore this truth about learning.  They practice what the book calls "sheep-dip" training programs where training classes "dip" employees in information that quickly wears off.  The only way that you learn from these classes is to apply what you heard right away.  &lt;em&gt;The learning happens after the class.&lt;/em&gt;  This is why I like the idea of &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2009/10/the-cms-myth-on-the-value-of-drop-in-labs.html"&gt;"drop-in labs"&lt;/a&gt; so much. I think the industry is starting to accept this "learn by doing" philosophy.  Knowledge management experts are talking less about repositories and more about communities and workspaces.  Emphasis seems to be shifting from the assets to the learning process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a personal level, being more conscious of these ideas is helping me be more deliberate about how I learn.  The book advises setting SMART (specific, measurable, achievable, and relevant) objectives and using techniques like SQ3R (Survey, Question, Read, Recite (summarize), Review).  But most importantly, learning has to be fun because we learn best through play.  Yet another reason to work in a field that you love.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pragmatic Thinking &amp;amp; Learning lives up to the high standards set by the &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/020161622X?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=contenthere-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=020161622X"&gt;The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=contenthere-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=020161622X" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /&gt; and other books on the &lt;a href="http://pragprog.com/"&gt;Pragmatic Bookshelf&lt;/a&gt;. It will be required reading for anyone that I hire.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Federated ECM</title>
    <content type='html'>I just wrote an article for &lt;a href="http://www.cutter.com/itjournal/"&gt;Cutter IT Journal&lt;/a&gt; about the decline of the "&lt;i&gt;one system to manage all&lt;/i&gt;" vision of ECM and now I am seeing evidence of this trend wherever I look.  The May issue of &lt;a href="http://www.econtentmag.com"&gt;EContent Magazine&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.econtentmag.com/Articles/ArticleReader.aspx?ArticleID=7919"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.filenet.com"&gt;FileNet's&lt;/a&gt; new strategy of Federated Content Management.  In the words of Chris McLaughlin, Filenet's director of marketing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;ECM isn't about picking one platform and stuffing everything into that one platform . . . it is about choosing a platform you want to build forward from and giv[ing] your organization a range of options on how to move forward with a CM strategy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;FileNet is now emphasizing standards and interoperability that "creates a union of information across multiple content stores."   This is a refreshing departure from the one-size-fits-all rhetoric that lead to expensive projects that under-delivered and left customers hopelessly locked into their vendors.</content>

    <title>Managing Projects with Trac</title>
    <content type='html'>[This is a continuation of a sporadic series that started with &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2005/03/managing-projects-open-way.html"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In open source projects, bug lists are not just to record of defects, they are often also the main organizing system for the project.  Bug lists are where new ideas for functionality are captured, releases are planned, and the vision of the project assembles.  Not everyone can contribute code, but they can report bugs and their needs.  I don't think corporate I.T. shops leverage issue trackers enough.  They mainly see them as a backward looking reactionary tool rather than a forward looking planning tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have standardized on the open source issue tracking software &lt;a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/"&gt;Trac&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="http://www.edgewall.org/"&gt;Edgewall Software&lt;/a&gt;.  Here is my system for using it....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usually my first engagement with a client is a short scoping/roadmap project.  During this time, I collect high level requirements and put them into a roadmap, recommend technologies, and do some estimation and planning around the initial release of the application.   During this phase, I usually work in a spreadsheet because it is quick for data entry and editing.   I try to organize functionality into phased releases that balance time to delivery and functionality.  I generally follow the practice of making the releases as small as possible.   It is also a good idea to organize releases into themes.  This makes it easy to communicate to stakeholders what is coming up next and when.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I start using Trac at the start of the first release project.  Here is how I configure it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I create a component for each of the major functional areas of the application.  Usually there is a "content" component.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I create version numbers for each of the releases.  1.0 is the initial release.  Then 1.1 for the release after that and so on.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;To the default ticket types (defect, enhancement, task), I add "port" to represent something that exists in legacy system that is being replaced; and "question."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the Roadmap section, I create the following milestones for each release:&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Infrastructure setup&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Design (e.g. 1.1 Online Calendar: 1 Design)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Code Complete (e.g. 1.1 Online Calendar: 2 Code Complete)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;QA Complete (e.g. 1.1 Online Calendar: 3 QA Complete)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maintenance (e.g. 1.1 Online Calendar: 4 Maintenance)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Trac comes with some basic reports but you can add new reports through the user interface if you know SQL.  I create a report for each release (filtering on the version field).   The Roadmap page is a dashboard showing how many tickets have been assigned to each milestone and how many are outstanding.  When I think that I have a good idea of how to implement a feature, I add comments to the ticket.   I can also associate files such as screenshots when I want to show how the feature might look. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So that is how I use Trac as an issue tracker.  But Trac does so much more.  Since we use &lt;a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/"&gt;Subversion&lt;/a&gt;, we set it up to browse the source code repository.   There is also a wiki feature which I use for project documentation.  In general, when documentation is on a wiki, I find that people become more concerned with the content than with the formatting.  That is a good thing because you want to reduce the effort to make documentation current.  Formatting puts up an unnecessary barrier because it sets the expectation that something has to be really polished before it is shown. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Timeline is a view of all that is happening on the project.  You can filter what to include from the following options:  milestones, ticket changes, repository checkins, and wiki changes.  The Timeline view also publishes to RSS so you can see all the information within your RSS reader.  However, I still like to get these notices over email which is another configuration option.   There is nothing like knowing immediately when someone checks in some code so that you can review and advise if there is a preferred way.  Our developers  usually  add the ticket number to their checkin comment so you can see why the code was checked in. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that is all there is to it.  Trac is a simple tool but extremely useful.   All of my clients that have used it so far have liked it although they hate it when I assign them tickets ;)</content>

    <title>One Hippo</title>
    <content type='html'>When I wrote the &lt;a href="http://www.hippocms.org"&gt;Hippo CMS&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/products-page/reports/open-source-web-content-management-in-hippo"&gt;evaluation&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/products-page/reports/open-source-content-management-in-java"&gt;Open Source Web Content Management in Java&lt;/a&gt;, I noted that Hippo really had no presence in North America yet but they were poised to enter the market.  Well, &lt;a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/open-source/?p=2119"&gt;it's happening&lt;/a&gt;.  Hippo BV bought David Sean Taylor's (of &lt;a href="http://portals.apache.org/jetspeed-2/"&gt;Apache Jetspeed&lt;/a&gt; fame) company &lt;a href="http://www.onehippo.com/en/about_us/bluesunrise"&gt;Blue Sunrise&lt;/a&gt;.  David is now the VP of Engineering and gives Hippo a presence on the West Coast (Bay Area).  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't know of any North American customers running on Hippo CMS yet.  But I wouldn't be surprised if Blue Sunrise customers running on Jetspeed start to move toward &lt;a href="http://www.onehippo.com/en/products,hippo-portal"&gt;Hippo Portal&lt;/a&gt;, which is based on Jetspeed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hippo BV also relaunched their website under a .com address: &lt;a href="http://www.onehippo.com"&gt;www.onehippo.com&lt;/a&gt;.  When browsing the website I noticed some commas in the URLs that made me suspect that they are running on the upcoming &lt;a href="http://www.hippocms.org/display/HIPPOECM/Home"&gt;Hippo ECM 1.0&lt;/a&gt; platform (a developer release is due out in April).  When I asked CTO &lt;a href="http://blogs.hippo.nl/arje/"&gt;ArjÃ© Cahn&lt;/a&gt; about it, he told me that they are running the site on &lt;a href="http://www.vignette.com"&gt;Vignette&lt;/a&gt;.  I hope their North American expansion doesn't make them lose their Dutch sense of humor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content>

    <title>Iron CMS</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.palantir.net/blog/george-demet"&gt;George DeMet&lt;/a&gt;, over at &lt;a href="http://www.palantir.net"&gt;Palantir&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.palantir.net/blog/ultimate-showdown-underway"&gt;has thrown down the gauntlet&lt;/a&gt;.   He will be hosting a &lt;a href="http://sxsw.com/interactive/talks/panels?action=show&amp;id=IAP0900113"&gt;SXSW panel where different CMS compete&lt;/a&gt; on implementations of the same website &lt;a href="http://www.palantir.net/sxsw/sxsw_designs.zip"&gt;design&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.palantir.net/sxsw/sxsw_spec_final.pdf"&gt;specification&lt;/a&gt;.  There will be three teams representing &lt;a href="http://drupal.org"&gt;Drupal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://joomla.org"&gt;Joomla!&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://wordpress.org"&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt;.  Each will have 100 hours to develop the site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I love the idea of different products going head to head in this way. This is much better than watching canned demos, which are difficult to compare because so many differences stem from the design of the demo rather than the design of the underlying software.  My &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2007/05/how-to-select-a-cms.html"&gt;CMS selection methodology relies heavily on comparing prototypes&lt;/a&gt;.  Then there is the classic &lt;a href="http://www.onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2001/11/28/catfight.html"&gt;Java Pet Store competition between Java and .NET.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, this competition will not legitimately crown the winner as the "best CMS" - it just shows a very good solution (software &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; implementation team) for building that particular specification.  In fact, the deck seems to be stacked in Drupal's favor.  First of all, Palantir is primarily a Drupal shop so it is unlikely that Goerge would write a specification that Drupal would struggle with.  Second, the Drupal team is lead by a Palantir employee. Third, the judge Mark Boulton is &lt;a href="http://www.markboulton.co.uk/journal/comments/drupal_7_redesign/"&gt;working for Acquia on Drupal 7 usability&lt;/a&gt; (this may play against Drupal because Mark is probably very used to picking apart Drupal 6 by now).  I am not saying that this competition is rigged, just that there are bound to be subconscious tendencies.  Still, the panel sounds like it will be good fun for the contestants and for the audience.  I wish I could be there to see it.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type='html'>Thanks for the comment Jeff.  My key point with the factory metaphor is that (like a factory) the CMS can produce anything that it has configured to produce but you need to have developers to configure it.  The developers can present the contributors with options that they can anticipate but the contributors cannot create new options that were not designed and implemented in the system.  In your example of aggregating and displaying information from different sources, each source (or source type) needs to be configured by someone technical.  The developer could create a generic RSS ingester but if all of the sudden a new source with a proprietary format comes along, a developer needs to configure the ingester to accommodate it.  The flex points that the business users can use to adjust on how content is displayed are also  pre-determined.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As for the webmaster being obsolete, I would say that those web marketing managers are playing that role.  There is just less intermediation and HTML typing involved.</content>

    <title>CMS Exit Strategies</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;A while back I &lt;a href="http://contenthere.blogspot.com/2004/12/keynote-themes-from-gilbane.html"&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; that I was hearing rumblings about Microsoft losing interest in their CMS product (MCMS, formerly NCompass).  &lt;a href="http://www.cmswatch.com/AskTony/Archive/?question_id=41"&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; "Ask Tony" article from CMS Watch is another datapoint that supports this theory and also gives some strategies for migrating off the platform.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just two years ago, there seemed to be so much momentum around MCMS and, with a company as formidable and resolute as Microsoft behind it, MCMS seemed like a really "safe" buy.  If it does turn out that Microsoft is shifting their strategy away from MCMS, it looks like the conservative buyer is running out of options.  It is not enough to look at market share and company financials anymore.  With all the &lt;a="http://www.cmswire.com/cms/ma/index.php"&gt;turmoil&lt;/a&gt; in the marketplace, buyers need to think about substitutability in their content management technology strategy.  And it's not just bankruptcy or sunsetting that you have to worry about.  Other concerns are changes in product direction, the escalating support and maintenance costs, and just general product neglect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below is a list of questions that should be asked during a CMS purchase:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do the licensing terms offer protection against the vendor discontinuing the product?  For example, some smaller vendors put their code in escrow to protect their customers in the event that they go out of business.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Does the technology store the data in proprietary formats?  If so, are there ways to get your content out?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you decide to move off the platform, how much of the custom integration work will be lost?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is the architecture monolithic or divisible?  A component based architecture with open API's increases the likelihood that you will be able to gradually move off the platform with less pain by substituting components with better options.  Products that run on top of standard open platforms (for example: J2EE or LAMP) have an advantage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What kind of programming skills does it take to maintain their software?  Beware of proprietary or rare scripting languages.  Those skills are harder to find and also history suggests that products move toward standardization.  Just look at how Vignette dragged their customers from Tcl to ASP then JSP.  When given a choice of integration technologies, use the more standards based one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Talk to long standing customers.  Ask them about migrations to newer versions.  Were they required by the vendor?  Did they solve problems or add functionality?  Was the functionality useful?  Was the migration expensive and/or disruptive?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These questions often get overlooked during the excitement of a deal and the focus on feature functionality.  It is hard enough to choose the best solution for your organization right now.  Thinking about the future and events that you cannot predict and have no control over makes it even harder.  But, whether your content is your product or it supports your product, it is too important not to have an exit strategy if things get bad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content>

    <title>Open Source Contribution Policy</title>

    <title>Three reasons why website localization projects fail</title>
    <content type='html'>Many organizations go into website localization initiatives unaware of the complexities and best practices involved. When this happens, frustration is the usual outcome. Having seen a number of localization efforts struggle, I believe that the root causes fall into the following three categories. The good news is that all of these problems can be avoided with experience and planning.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
1. The website was not designed for localization&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
Some websites are easier to localize than others. In the worst case, it is better to start over with a new website rather than try to remediate and localize an existing site. The best time to prepare a site for localization is before it is built. You need to select a suitable CMS and &lt;a href="http://content.lionbridge.com/planning-for-localization/"&gt;follow best practices during implementation and content development&lt;/a&gt;. If you didn't build the website with localization in mind, you (or your integrator) probably didn't follow these guidelines, which are usually the first corners to be cut when budgets and timelines get thin. The worst part is that you won't know how prepared you are for localization until you try it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Don't let the integrator leave until you have successfully, published your second language. If your integrator is already gone, a quick assessment can reveal warning signs so you can get a head start on remediation.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
2. No global business strategy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
Multi-lingual publishing is (or should be) part of a larger strategy to extend your market into other languages and cultures. If you succeed in getting noticed by different language speakers but fail to help them get value from your products and services, you are no better off. You need to make sure your products, sales, and customer service are sufficiently prepared to serve these new customers. Otherwise your localized website becomes an expensive burden that is tempting to neglect rather than &amp;nbsp;an investment that drives growth.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
3. Lack of commitment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
A common failing is to treat a website as a technology asset that can be neglected after launch. &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2010/06/jeff-cram-your-website-is-not-project.html"&gt;Your website is not a project&lt;/a&gt;. If you want your site to engage with your audience, you need to stay engaged. Multilingual publishing raises the stakes by adding another dimension and cost multiplier to effective website management. If you can't justify the cost of maintaining localized sites, they will rapidly degrade into an embarrassment. &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2013/04/portfolio-rot.html"&gt;The web is littered with rotting websites&lt;/a&gt;. The worst examples are localized websites that have fallen into disrepair after initial translation.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    <content type='html'>Seth,  I&amp;#39;ve never had to deal with &amp;quot;how&amp;quot; to do this, but please reconsider a few assumptions on the &amp;quot;why&amp;quot; aspect of the issue.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-----&lt;br&gt;First, the assumption that because something was published on a public site it will be available to the plaintiff.   Emphasis here is on the plaintiff-- it&amp;#39;s not just that a copy exists, but that the plaintiff can get a copy of it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The wayback machine doesn&amp;#39;t archive everything, chances are low that public search caches would have a 7+ year old file, and the probability that the plaintiff would have a hard copy of an old doc… well, I guess that depends on the plaintiff.  If I&amp;#39;m a defendant, my goal is to minimize the chance that the plaintiff can get his hands on anything that can possibly be used against me.  If I have a copy of something, there&amp;#39;s a 100% probability that the plaintiff will get it.  If I don&amp;#39;t have a copy, that probability drops significantly --especially for older files.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-----&lt;br&gt;Second, the assumption that anything published to an external audience is not potentially damaging to an organization.  Situations change over time, and if a plaintiff can pull up data that helps him support a case then that&amp;#39;s obviously not in the best interest of the defendant.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-----&lt;br&gt;Third, the assumption that all versions are published externally.  A WCM may contain versions of a file that were never published externally, and it&amp;#39;s possible such versions would be covered under a &amp;quot;do not destroy&amp;quot; order associated with a legal proceeding.  Those non-published versions could contain damaging material.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-----&lt;br&gt;Fourth is the assumption that the risk of not being able to refute a forgery is greater than the risk of holding on to an old document.  Introducing a forged document into a legal proceeding is a risky strategy,  and I&amp;#39;m not sure many legal teams for a plaintiff would want to assume that risk--it&amp;#39;s like a bluff in poker only with a criminal penalty.  On the other hand, defendants get burned all the time by the data they possess.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-----&lt;br&gt;Fifth is the assumption that because the data is in digital format the cost of discovery is negligible because files don&amp;#39;t require manual analysis.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;E-discovery typically generates many many thousands of files, and the fact that files are searchable doesn&amp;#39;t mean a &amp;quot;manual&amp;quot; analysis won&amp;#39;t be done.  The searcher may query a particular phrase but may be even more interested in the context in which that phrase was used, which requires manual analysis.  Obviously the fewer versions to analyze the better.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If the defendant&amp;#39;s legal team is providing data to a plaintiff you can bet they&amp;#39;ll want to know what&amp;#39;s in that data, and that requires manual analysis.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also consider that attorneys may not have direct access to search through a WCM system due to company policy, so in that case the web team must produce the required data.  If source files are in XML or some other more raw format they&amp;#39;re more difficult for people to manually analyze (or the web team may have to transform them --that&amp;#39;s more of an opportunity cost, but still it&amp;#39;s a cost).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Finally, e-discovery has become a legal specialty and may require hiring additional legal staff with that specific expertise.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-----&lt;br&gt;While I&amp;#39;ve never seen this requirement in a WCM project, it doesn&amp;#39;t surprise me to see it. WCM &amp;amp; RM are not strangers in the public sector (I spent 9+ years working with clients in that sector in a previous life).  The only thing that seems odd to me is the 10 year time frame (seems long) but I don&amp;#39;t know the records management requirements of the industry client in this case.</content>

    <title>Google is in my kitchen</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I have taken a certain amount of pride in not being swept up in the Google craze.  Yes, &lt;a href="http://www.google.com"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; is the only search engine that I use and when I want to get directions, &lt;a href="http://maps.google.com"&gt;maps.google.com&lt;/a&gt; is the URL I enter.  However, I have held back from getting a &lt;a href="http://mail.google.com"&gt;GMail&lt;/a&gt; account or setting up a Google Calendar.  That took a lot of will power last year when people were introducing themselves as "Hi, I am so-and-so, do you want an invitation for a GMail account?"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is my beef against the Goog?  Nothing really.  I have just had the same Yahoo! mail account for 8 years and I can't imagine giving it up.  In fact, my loyalty to Yahoo! has become a cornerstone of my thinking about digital businesses.  The idea is that you can't compete on functionality because it is less expensive for a competitor to copy your functionality than it was for you to build in the first place.  To bring an innovative feature to the market, it takes a lot of design and trial and error.  When you copy a feature, you get to learn from your competitors mistakes and take a more direct route to a better solution.  What keeps customers is data which translates into switching costs for users.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Email is particularly interesting because it is not just the inbox.  That can be easily imported.  It is the entry for you in all your friends and associates address books.  So, when you change your email service provider, you have to tell everyone your new address and they have to update your contact information.  I know there are services like &lt;a href="http://www.plaxo.com/"&gt;Plaxo&lt;/a&gt; but they creep me out too much to use.  As an aside, never send out the mail address that comes with your ISP.  That will unnecessarily tie you to that ISP even if there is a better option out there.  Most of the current &lt;a href="http://www.aol.com"&gt;AOL&lt;/a&gt; users that I know don't care for the service but just keep paying AOL to keep their email address.  Most colleges and universities have free email forwarding services for alumni.  If you are not totally ashamed of your alma mater, you might consider taking advantage of their email forward service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, back to Google.  Hell or high water, I am keeping my Yahoo! mail account.    But, recently Google has been working its way into my life.  I just got another Dell laptop and, what do you know, Google Desktop was pre-installed.  In setting up the computer, I anguished for a couple of minutes over whether to uninstall it ("It is going to slow up my machine."  "It may help me someday and, besides, I want to know what all the fuss is about.")  Google Desktop stayed.  Then a colleague from &lt;a href="http://www.cmprofessionals.org"&gt;CM Professionals&lt;/a&gt; sent me a link to a &lt;a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com"&gt;Google Spreadsheet&lt;/a&gt;.  Of course, the first step was to create an account.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first, I thought the temptation of Google was threatening my data theory.  But now I am thinking that it is supporting it.  Google is trying to lure me with data that I don't have:  indexes of my local files, spreadsheets that my colleagues created.  Once they hook me in to registering and using Google tools to collaborate with my colleagues, they will be able to offer me other services.  I would have to say it worked.  I registered with Google....  Using my Yahoo! mail address ;).&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Open Source Content Management Webinar</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I don't normally like the standard webcast format (either as an audience member or presenter) so when it was my turn to do the next Optaros webinar, I proposed a more interactive session with no slides, more audience participation, and more dialog.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I got my wish and I am excited about this &lt;a href="https://optaros.webex.com/optaros/onstage/g.php?d=711448316&amp;t=a"&gt;event&lt;/a&gt;: Tuesday, September 26th, 2006. 1PM Eastern Daylight Time.  Joining me will be &lt;a href="http://asay.blogspot.com/"&gt;Matt Asay&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="http://www.alfresco.com"&gt;Alfresco&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0116506/"&gt;Paul Everitt&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="http://www.zeapartners.org/"&gt;ZEA Partners&lt;/a&gt;, and, my colleague, the esteemed &lt;a href="http://www.openparenthesis.org/"&gt;Dr. John Eckman&lt;/a&gt;.  I don't know exactly how the session is going to play out but here is what I am thinking....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are not going to talk about products, functionality, market share, magic quadrants or any of those boring vendor or analyst presentation topics.  Instead, we are going to talk about the benefits and implications of open source software in the content management industry.  Here are the types of questions we will be discussing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Are there fundamental differences between open source and proprietary content management systems?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How should an open source content management solution be selected?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What types of organizations are best positioned to use open source software to solve their content management challenges?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What are the benefits and limitations of open source content management systems?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the audience will really determine the direction of the discussion because we will be asking the audience to chat in their questions.  From the experience of the panel, we can answer questions about how open source software companies function, open source implementation projects, living with open source solutions, why people participate in open source.  If you have seen one of the panelists speak and could not fight your way through the crowd to ask a follow up question, or you are just intrigued by this idea of free software and want to see what all the fuss is about, you should join us.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Geek Social</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Last night I attended the &lt;a href="http://www.geniusworkshop.com/"&gt;Genius Workshop&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="http://boston.citysearch.com/profile/4749150/cambridge_ma/christopher_s_restaurant_and_bar.html"&gt;Christophers Restaurant in Cambridge&lt;/a&gt;.  In the words of founder and organizer &lt;a href="http://rura.org/shimon/"&gt;Shimon Rura&lt;/a&gt;, the title is meant to be more aspirational than descriptive.  The structure is very informal: just a bunch of smart and creative people talking about what they are working on and new ideas.  This is the third one of these events that I have attended and every one has been a fun and interesting experience.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The theme that was discussed on our side of the table was Web 2.0 initiatives.  Many people in the group were working on projects (jobs, hobbies or both) that explored new and innovative ways to store and use information.  On my end of the table there were:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Alexis Ohanian of &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com"&gt;reddit.com&lt;/a&gt; which is a little like Slashdot but without the editorial oversight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Shimon Rura built &lt;a href="http://www.voo2do.com"&gt;Voo2do&lt;/a&gt; for his own use and it caught on virally to the point where it has over 7,000 users and was named by &lt;a href="http://web2.wsj2.com/"&gt;Dion Hinchcliffe's Web 2.0 blog&lt;/a&gt; as the Best Online To Do list over &lt;a href="http://www.tadalist.com/"&gt;BaseCamp's Ta-Da List&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://rememberthemilk.com/"&gt;Remember The Milk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.blogbridge.com"&gt;Pito Silas from BlogBridge&lt;/a&gt; a desktop RSS aggregator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0141264/"&gt;Ted Gilchrist creator of BotCasts&lt;/a&gt; a service that translates blogs into pod-casts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.wikipedia.org"&gt;Wikipedia's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Sj"&gt;Sam "SJ" Klein&lt;/a&gt; was also there although he was at the other end of the table and I didn't get to talk to him until I was leaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many interesting topics were discussed but two that stand out are: that VC's have a hard time getting involved with these Web 2.0 projects which require so little capital (the VCs don't have the bandwidth to manage tens of sub-one million dollar investments); and how can these new services make money when people expect everything for free and the incumbent has very little advantage over the new market entrant willing to give the service away to get market share. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>BBC&amp;#39;s 15 Web Principles</title>
    <content type='html'>Brendan Quinn just sent &lt;a href="http://www.tomski.com/archive/new_archive/000063.html"&gt;The BBC's Fifteen Web Principles&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="http://www.cmprofessionals.org"&gt;CM Pros&lt;/a&gt; mailing list.  If you want to think about how to leverage your content in a Web 2.0 world, this is a great place to start.  One of the primary themes is simplicity - an idea that I am getting very interested in.</content>

    <title>Nice simple introduction to Python</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I just read &lt;a href="http://martinaspeli.net/"&gt;Martin Aspeli's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.cio.com"&gt;CIO Magazine&lt;/a&gt; article &lt;a href="http://www.cio.com/article/185350/You_Used_Python_to_Write_WHAT_/1"&gt;"You Used Python to Write WHAT?"&lt;/a&gt; I, myself, wouldn't have dared to write an article about a programming language for a non-technical audience, but Martin actually pulled it off. The article nicely covers some of the history, core concepts, and uses of the Python language without succumbing into the temptation to get into the techy details - perfect to send to a CIO that just needs enough information to feel comfortable with the language. Nice job Martin!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content>

    <title>Getting your Google mojo back</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sggottlieb/3146525945/" title="Google, why do you hate me so? by sggottlieb, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3130/3146525945_46d85b57b2.jpg" width="500" height="459" alt="Google, why do you hate me so?" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When I migrated &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net"&gt;Enter Content Here&lt;/a&gt; off of &lt;a href="http://www.blogger.com"&gt;Blogger&lt;/a&gt;, moving the content and comments was really easy - literally just the click of a button.  This was a nice surprise because my expectations were based on a typically painful CMS migration.  Because I use &lt;a href="http://www.feedburner.com"&gt;FeedBurner&lt;/a&gt;, my RSS readership experienced little disruption either.  I already had moved my Blogger blog to a custom domain and WordPress allows you to format your own permalinks so it was easy to map the old URLs to the new with a simple Apache Rewrite Rule.  Within my blog.contenthere.net virtual host of my hosting provider, I created the rule:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RewriteRule .* http://www.contenthere.net%{REQUEST_URI}&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The one piece of the move that proved to be an issue was getting Google to update its index and move entries from blog.contenthere.net to &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net"&gt;www.contenthere.net&lt;/a&gt;.  This was particularly problematic because I wanted to use the &lt;a href="http://aleembawany.com/projects/wordpress/google-custom-search-plugin/"&gt;Google Custom Search Plugin for WordPress&lt;/a&gt; so I could include &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/products-page"&gt;product pages&lt;/a&gt; and other content in my search results.  I submitted a dynamically updated &lt;a href="http://sitemaps.org/"&gt;Sitemap&lt;/a&gt; (using the &lt;a href="http://www.arnebrachhold.de/projects/wordpress-plugins/google-xml-sitemaps-generator/"&gt;Wordpress Sitemap Plugin&lt;/a&gt;), Google ignored all of my entries (see image on top).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I learned from the support forum that Google probably thought that these new pages (under www.contenthere.net) were duplicates of the blog.contenthere.net pages and was skipping them.  I don't really understand why that is because there is no way that the rendered pages could be identical.  I just had to take it on faith.  The only way to get Google to update its index is to configure your rewrite to send down a status code of 301 (permanent redirect).  The updated rewrite rule looks like this:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;RewriteRule .* http://www.contenthere.net%{REQUEST_URI} [R=301]&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While I was at writing rewrite rules, I added a few more to handle the situations where WordPress's permalink algorithm was different than Blogger's.  The biggest difference is that Blogger omits "The" and "A" from a post title when building a permalink.  There were also discrepancies where I changed the title of the post after publishing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To improve my custom Google search in the short term, I added the site blog.contenthere.net to the list of indexed sites.  This way people using the onboard search can still find the pages that have not yet been re-indexed and, when they do, Google should get the 301 code.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As for my old blogger blog (contenthere.blogspot.com), I did everything I could to make it as ugly and unappealing as possible.  I wrote messages explaining the move all over the template.  What I really wanted to do was have a link from each post to the new URL.  However, there is no path variable that would allow me to construct a new link by concatenating the new domain (www.contenthere.net) to the current path.  Blogger just has a tag for the full URL (data:post.url) and I couldn't find syntax for substrings.  I could have done it with Javascript but didn't want to bother.  Instead, I inserted a search form for my custom search in each post and preloaded it with the blog post title.  This approach has the additional benefits of potentially giving the visitor more recent content and also sending them through Google to give it another chance to update its index.  I have a free statcounter collecting traffic statistics on that site.  When it gets down to 0, I will probably delete the whole blog.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since making these changes, my search based traffic is back to its pre-migration levels.  Google still doesn't seem to take an interest in my Sitemap but that doesn't seem to matter.  Through the process, I have learned that originally hosting my blog on Blogger did not lock me into the platform.  Instead, it allowed me to focus on the content and quickly establish a voice in the blogosphere without worrying about infrastructure.  Blogger's support of custom URL's was critical to minimizing lock-in.  When I migrated to a custom domain, Blogger helped route traffic from the blogspot URL to the new one.  This put me in a good position to move to the blog to any platform I chose.</content>

    <title>Plone Correspondence School</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Everything you need to know about building a Plone Site&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Books&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?t=contenthere-20&amp;o=1&amp;p=8&amp;l=as1&amp;asins=1590593294&amp;fc1=000000&amp;IS2=1&amp;lt1=_blank&amp;lc1=0000ff&amp;bc1=000000&amp;bg1=ffffff&amp;f=ifr" style="width:120px;height:240px;" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; This book is a little outdated but it is really good at getting you started using Plone and understanding the architecture.  I have heard that &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?link_code=ur2&amp;tag=contenthere-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;location=%2FPlone-Content-Management-Essentials-Meloni%2Fdp%2F0672326876%2Fsr%3D1-1%2Fqid%3D1158180172%2Fref%3Dpd_bbs_1%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks"&gt;Plone Content Management Essentials&lt;/a&gt; is also a good getting started book but I have not read it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?t=contenthere-20&amp;o=1&amp;p=8&amp;l=as1&amp;asins=0976553406&amp;fc1=000000&amp;IS2=1&amp;lt1=_blank&amp;lc1=0000ff&amp;bc1=000000&amp;bg1=ffffff&amp;f=ifr" style="width:120px;height:240px;" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;  When you are starting to get serious about building websites in Plone, you should read Plone Live.  This book discusses how to do Filesystem based development and packaging components as products.  It is also regularly updated, which maybe all books out open source should be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?t=contenthere-20&amp;o=1&amp;p=8&amp;l=as1&amp;asins=1590593561&amp;fc1=000000&amp;IS2=1&amp;lt1=_blank&amp;lc1=0000ff&amp;bc1=000000&amp;bg1=ffffff&amp;f=ifr" style="width:120px;height:240px;" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;  At the point where you start writing Python code that is more advanced than what you copy of the web, buy Dive Into Python.  This will walk you through some nicely written Python code and explain how it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?t=contenthere-20&amp;o=1&amp;p=8&amp;l=as1&amp;asins=0764548573&amp;fc1=000000&amp;IS2=1&amp;lt1=_blank&amp;lc1=0000ff&amp;bc1=000000&amp;bg1=ffffff&amp;f=ifr" style="width:120px;height:240px;" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;  Although seriously out of date and out of print, The Zope Bible is still the best book on the Zope 2.x series.  Unfortunately, the newer Zope books are all on Zope 3.x which is less relevant to your average Plone developer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Tutorials&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://plone.org/documentation/tutorial/creating-custom-style" style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;File System Plone Skin&lt;/a&gt;.  The plone.org site looks nice but in case you don't want you site to look &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;exactly like it&lt;/span&gt;, follow this tutorial.  Don't dump stuff into the custom folder in the ZMI.  Do it the right  way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://plone.org/documentation/tutorial/plone-apache" style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Running Plone behind Apache&lt;/a&gt;.  If you are going to expose your Plone site on the big Internet, you should run it behind Apache.  &lt;a href="http://plone.org/documentation/tutorial/plone-apache"&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is the most detailed description of how to do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://plone.org/products/cachefu" style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;CacheFu and Squid&lt;/a&gt;.  If you think your site might get some heavy traffic.  Run &lt;a href="http://plone.org/products/cachefu"&gt;CacheFu&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://plone.org/documentation/tutorial/robust-installation/installing-zope" style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Zope/ZEO Configuration&lt;/a&gt;.  If you think that someone would care if your Zope instance crashed, or if you want more performance, set up a ZEO configuration.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Hire a Teacher&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joel Burton runs a great program called &lt;a href="http://plonebootcamps.com/"&gt;Plone Bootcamps&lt;/a&gt;.  It is amazingly affordable if you have a big group.  Nate Aune from &lt;a href="http://www.jazkarta.com/"&gt;Jazkarta&lt;/a&gt; is an excellent source for more customized training.</content>

    <title>Snow Leopard Issues</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;For some reason, I upgraded to Snow Leopard at my first opportunity.  To tell the truth, the end-user improvements are pretty modest and it is difficult to perceive Snow Leopard's slight speed improvements.  That is not to say that the upgrade did not have impact.  Some software that I regularly use stopped working.  I am all up and working now and here is now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;style type="text/css"&gt;table.padded-table td { padding:10px; text-align:left } table.padded-table th { padding:10px; text-align:left; font-weight:bold }&lt;/style&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;table class="padded-table"&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;th width="50%"&gt;Problem&lt;/th&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;th width="50%"&gt;Solution&lt;/th&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oxygen 9.3 stopped working&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;td&gt;I upgraded to Oxygen 10.3 for $147&lt;/td&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My macport MySQL, Apache, PHP setup broke&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;td&gt;I tried to do port upgrade of MySQL and PHP and it failed.  Compiling my own PHP didn't work either.  I wound up installing the MySQL package from the MySQL site and using the Apache and PHP (5.3) that comes with Snow Leopard.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My &lt;a href="http://ez.no"&gt;eZ Publish&lt;/a&gt; development environment broke&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;td&gt;This was because I upgraded to PHP 5.3.  This was easily fixed by re-installing eZ Publish because eZ Publish is compatible with PHP 5.3&lt;/td&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My &lt;a href="http://ez.no"&gt;Drupal&lt;/a&gt; development environment broke&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;td&gt;Drupal is not compatible with PHP 5.3.  Until it is, I am running it on &lt;a href="http://www.mamp.info/en/index.html"&gt;MAMP&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Python MySQL did not easy_install for Python 2.6&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;td&gt;This is the problem that I struggled most with.  I followed the instructions &lt;a href="http://cd34.com/blog/programming/python/mysql-python-and-snow-leopard/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  The compile and build worked but I could not import the library.  I finally solved the problem by re-installing the 32 bit version of MySQL, setting Python to run in 32 bit, and following &lt;a href="http://www.zen-hacking.com/2009/09/01/python-mysql-under-snow-leopard/"&gt;these simple instructions&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://agilewebsolutions.com/products/1Password"&gt;1Password&lt;/a&gt; 2.x is incompatible with Snow Leopard&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;td&gt;I pre-purchased version 3 and enrolled in the 3.0 beta program.  The UI looks really slick and I am happy that I upgraded.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.zennaware.com/"&gt;Cornerstone&lt;/a&gt; is incompatible with Snow Leopard&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;td&gt;I am waiting for the next release of Cornerstone (due this month) that will be Snow Leopard compatible and also support Subversion 1.6.  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking back, it would have made more sense to wait on the upgrade and see what other people on the mailing lists said about their experiences.  But, since I figure I would share what I learned.  &lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>World Plone Day 2010</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Mark your calendars, &lt;a href="http://plone.org/events/wpd"&gt;World Plone Day&lt;/a&gt; is on April 28th.  World Plone Day is a free, annual, international event designed to introduce the &lt;a href="http://plone.org"&gt;Plone&lt;/a&gt; content management system to people outside of the Plone community.  This year it is being held in 36 locations in 29 countries.  The agenda usually contains a balance of business and technical topics. I just had a look at the &lt;a href="http://bostonworldploneday2010-seth.eventbrite.com/"&gt;Boston World Plone Day agenda&lt;/a&gt; and it looks particularly good.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have not looked at Plone recently, you should.  With the official release of version 4.0 right around the corner, a lot of changes have happened.  The architecture leverages more of the new Zope 3 technologies, performance has improved, and development techniques have evolved.  A considerable amount of work is being done to make theming easier using tools like &lt;a href="http://jazkarta.com/services/training/deliverance-training"&gt;Deliverance&lt;/a&gt;.  Also, the &lt;a href="http://nosql-database.org/"&gt;NoSQL movement&lt;/a&gt; hype may make the underlying object database (ZODB) less intimidating to architects.  From a user perspective, the team has focused on some subtle improvements such as switching the default rich text editor to TinyMCE and creating a new default theme. &lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Commercial Open Source</title>
    <content type='html'>There are a number of companies making money "selling" open source software. These products can be very attractive to buyers who are considering using open source but do not want to give up commercial software accountability. When evaluating commercial open source options, in addition to understanding how these applications may satisfy your requirements, you should ask two additional questions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ol type="A"&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;How does this company make money?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;Will you be charged fairly for your intended use of the software?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first question, is very important. You don't want to partner with a company that does not have a sound business model. Distributing software under an open source license is a practical and powerful business strategy that dramatically reduces the cost of sales and marketing. However, even with low expenses, a healthy bottom line depends on a reliable revenue stream. If the vendor goes out of business, you will lose all the benefits of going with commercial open source. You &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt;to contribute to the health of the vendor, but you don't want to pay beyond the value you enjoy. You also want flexibility if you do not experience the value that you have been promised.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To help answer these questions, I thought it would be useful to explain the different business models that commercial open source vendors practice. To do this, I will break them down to groups with examples. These categories are not exclusive. You will see that some companies practice hybrids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tiered Versions&lt;/strong&gt;. Many commercial open source vendors distribute a trimmed down "Community Version" of their software under a restrictive open source license such as the GPL, and then sell a more full featured "Enterprise Version." Usually the features that are considered necessary for enterprise deployments (such as LDAP integration, clustering, etc.) are withheld from the community version. The enterprise version may be presented as a bundle of commercially licensed "plugins" that work on top of the community foundation or it might be a totally different code base. The enterprise version will usually be sold with a maintenance package which provides commercial style support for an annual subscription fee. The community edition may or not be supportable. &lt;a href="http://www.sugarcrm.com/crm/"&gt;SugarCRM&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.jahia.org/jahia/home.html"&gt;Jahia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.magnolia.info/"&gt;Magnolia&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.zimbra.com/"&gt;Zimbra&lt;/a&gt; fall into this category. Jahia is interesting because a customer can earn credit toward licensing fees of the enterprise version by underwriting the development of a feature that is on the product roadmap.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Badgeware&lt;/strong&gt;. A corollary to the "Tiered Version" model is to distribute a single, open source licensed code base but require non-paying users to display a "powered by" logo on the application. For WCM software, this includes all the externally facing pages of your website. There is a &lt;a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/index.php?p=3430"&gt;debate&lt;/a&gt; whether software distributed under these restrictions qualifies as open source. The badge requirement may be tolerable for some informal uses such as intranets or a non-profit that looks at their software vendor as a contributing sponsor. &lt;a href="http://www.alfresco.com/"&gt;Alfresco&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.jahia.org/"&gt;Jahia&lt;/a&gt; have these restrictions on the free versions of their software.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dual License&lt;/strong&gt;. While often confused with the "Tiered Version" model, a Dual License is where the &lt;em&gt;exact same&lt;/em&gt; software is distributed under a commercial&lt;em&gt; and&lt;/em&gt; open source license. Which license you need depends on how you intend to use the software. The open source version of the license is usually the GPL or a similar license that would prevent the user from selling a derived work or bundling it with a commercial application. If you are just using the software to run your business, you can usually go with the open source version. If you are using it in the creation of a proprietary &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;[updated based on Sandro's comment]&lt;/span&gt; product, you need the commercially licensed version. This is how &lt;a href="http://ez.no/"&gt;eZ publish&lt;/a&gt; is distributed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support&lt;/strong&gt;. Probably all commercial open source companies rely on support and/or maintenance revenues. However, some companies make it difficult not to purchase support. One model is to distribute a "Community Version" that, while functionally equal to the "Enterprise Version," is "unsupported." This may mean that it has not been as fully tested as the packaged versions that are distributed to paying customers. It may also mean that if you ask for help, you need to migrate to the enterprise bundle before someone will even respond. Companies that have these kind of policies require their customers to decide whether they ever will need support &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; downloading the software. They generally have the attitude that if you use the software for production purposes, you should be paying. &lt;a href="http://www.alfresco.com/"&gt;Alfresco&lt;/a&gt; operates in this way. Other companies are more liberal and allow you buy your support package the first time you need it. This is how eZ publish works. There are also companies that run community based projects and sell support packages. Examples include &lt;a href="http://www.alkacon.com/alkacon/en/"&gt;Alkacon&lt;/a&gt; software (the company behind &lt;a href="http://www.opencms.org/"&gt;OpenCMS&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href="http://outerthought.org/site/services.html"&gt;Outerthought&lt;/a&gt; (the company behind &lt;a href="http://cocoondev.org/daisy/index.html"&gt;Daisy&lt;/a&gt;). In general, if the software is very widely used, a vendor can afford to be more flexible about support. If there are millions of downloads, they only need a small percentage of users to actually buy a support package. That is why &lt;a href="http://www.mysql.com/"&gt;MySQL&lt;/a&gt; is so successful. I don't know if a CMS application could achieve the user base to make those multiples work but there are a number of companies that are trying to find out.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All of these business models try to do one thing: create value for customers and make them pay proportionately. This is not a bad thing. It is what businesses do. Some companies consider the value as the software itself and the users are obligated to pay to use it. Other vendors feel like the value is in the service (support and maintenance). Like all partnerships, your relationship with your software vendor will be better if you understand each others' needs and perspectives and work together under terms that are mutually beneficial. The relationship will likely fail if either side tries to take advantage of the other by trying to get services for free or locking the customer into unreasonable terms. This does not mean that using commercial open source software for free is immoral. The software vendor also needs to think of getting value from its non-paying user base. But that was a topic for another &lt;a href="http://contenthere.blogspot.com/2006/08/commercial-open-source-business.html"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;.</content>

    <title>Jeff Potts strikes out on his own with Metaversant</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;My friend and former &lt;a href="http://www.optaros.com"&gt;Optaros&lt;/a&gt; colleague Jeff Potts &lt;a href="http://ecmarchitect.com/archives/2010/04/22/1153"&gt;recently announced that he has left Optaros to form a new company called Metaversant&lt;/a&gt;.  Jeff was Optaros' superstar &lt;a href="http://www.alfresco.com"&gt;Alfresco&lt;/a&gt; guy.  He put Optaros on the Alfresco map and &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2008/02/jeff-potts-alfresco-contributor-of-the-year.html"&gt;contributed to the Alfresco community&lt;/a&gt; by writing a great book (&lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2008/12/review-alfresco-developer-guide.html"&gt;The Alfresco Developer Guide&lt;/a&gt;), maintaining useful information on his &lt;a href="http://ecmarchitect.com"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;, and also publicly pushing Alfresco in the right direction.  Jeff is a charter member of my informal "Content Here Information Partner (CHIPs)" network and I have regular briefings with him to keep up to date on all things Alfresco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since Optaros has shifted its strategy to focus on the intersection of community, commerce, and content, Alfresco's position as a core offering has diminished.  Alfresco is more oriented toward file-based collaboration, intranets, and digital asset management than social publishing and commerce.  Metaversant will focus on training and advising Alfresco customers.  I admire Jeff's expertise in and passion and I know that he will be successful in this new venture.  He will certainly get referrals from me.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>What is in a name?</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;What is in a name? Well, if it is a really good name like &lt;a href="http://www.initmarketing.com/" title="InitMarketing"&gt;InitMarketing&lt;/a&gt;, I would say a very clever company. A while back I announced that &lt;a href="http://sandro.groganz.com/weblog"&gt;Sandro Groganz&lt;/a&gt; was starting a new marketing company specializing in open source businesses. He didn't have a name at the time, which I thought was... well... curious (being a marketing company, after all). But I am glad he waited because InitMarketing is awesome on so many levels. No logo yet. They are holding a contest where the public submits their ideas. These two things should tell you that InitMarketing is not just another marketing organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other great thing about InitMarketing is my friend and colleague &lt;a href="http://stephesblog.blogs.com"&gt;Stephe Walli&lt;/a&gt; has joined the company. Stephe brings a wealth of knowledge about open source business and a great network. He is also a fun guy to work with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content>

    <title>Four years and still going strong</title>
    <content type='html'>Four years ago today I started Enter Content Here with &lt;a href="http://blog.contenthere.net/2004/11/content-management-definition.html"&gt;a post defining content management&lt;/a&gt;.  The post focused on &lt;em&gt;what was being managed&lt;/em&gt; and how to differentiate that from other types of data.  Over the past years this blog has reported and explored lots of ideas but content (or, as &lt;a href="http://www.metatorial.com/"&gt;Bob Boiko&lt;/a&gt; would say "Information") has always remained in the center of it all.  I am still interested &lt;a href="http://blog.contenthere.net/2008/05/content-is-not-data.html"&gt;what distinguishes content from other data&lt;/a&gt; but I think the focus needs to shift to the  "management" end of the phrase "content management."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the saying "content management is a verb not a product" because it emphasizes the effort and process required to effectively create and use information.  However, there are better verbs to describe this effort than "management" - a vague word that often connotes what we do with undesirable things like risk, waste, and stress.  Content is an asset, not a liability (unless you are getting sued and you need to pay lawyers to read it), and working with it should be described in more positive and active language: communicating, creating, educating, publishing, collaborating, connecting, etc.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is still much more to write about the processes and technologies that people use to release value from information.  It has been four years and I feel like I am just getting started.</content>

    <title>Another flower war</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Not quite the War of the Roses, there is a little skirmish happening between &lt;a href="http://www.magnolia-cms.com/home.html"&gt;Magnolia International (as in the CMS company)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://ma.gnolia.com/"&gt;Ma.gnolia (the off-again, on-again social bookmarking site)&lt;/a&gt;.  The squabble began shortly after Ma.noglia's recent resurrection (&lt;a href="http://blog.backblaze.com/2009/03/02/magnolia-wilts-with-no-backup/"&gt;it had shut down in February 2009&lt;/a&gt;) when &lt;a href="http://ma.gnolia.com/blog/2009/09/29/by-any-other-name"&gt;Magnolia International issued what appears to be a Cease and Desist order&lt;/a&gt;. It is a little unclear because it was written by Magnolia's CEO, Pascal Mangold (not an attorney) and it seems to be more of a request than a demand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am no trademark attorney but, since that hasn't stopped anyone else, I figured I would weigh in from a common sense perspective.  I understand how Magnolia International would want ma.gnolia.com to be out of the picture.  They probably also want ExxonMobile to stop using &lt;a href="http://www.magnolia.com/corporate/"&gt;magnolia.com&lt;/a&gt;.  ExxonMobile probably wasn't paying attention when, then Obinary International, Magnolia registered magnolia.info to market their new open source CMS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does Ma.gnolia have the right to use their domain?  I don't know.  There are very specific legal distinctions to determine legal and illegal trademark infringement but I don't think it really matters.  In the real world, it happens all the time.  This is why you try to grab all the variations of your domain (.net, .org, and .biz as well as -sucks.com, -sucks.net, and -sucks.biz) when you are branding your company.  You do your best to claim your little spot on the web and you work with what you've got.  Getting lawyers involved is an expensive distraction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am sure that Pascal knows all this and that is why he wrote his own letter.  Hey, it was worth a try.  Maybe this will lead to a negotiation for Magnolia to purchase gnolia.com.   Who knows how serious Ma.gnolia is about their business.  Personally, I don't think I would use a bookmarking service that had a track record of closing down and opening up again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a particularly interesting story.  What would be more interesting is if Magnolia International went after ExxonMobile.  What the heck is ExxonMobile doing with that domain anyway?&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Retail Therapy for OpenCms</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I just saw an announcement for a new integration between &lt;a href="http://www.opencms.org"&gt;OpenCms&lt;/a&gt; and the Java based commerce system &lt;a href="http://www.konakart.com"&gt;KonaKart&lt;/a&gt;. The integration is implemented as an installable OpenCms module that connects to KonaKart over a SOAP API. For those of you who are new to KonaKart, it is free to use but is not open source licensed. However, many of the underlying components (such as Struts and Torque) are open source and customers are free to tinker with those. Another interesting aspect of KonaKart is that there is a straight migration plan from the popular PHP commerce system &lt;a href="http://www.oscommerce.com/"&gt;osCommerce&lt;/a&gt;. The database structures are identical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commerce is not entirely new to OpenCms. I remember seeing shopping functionality on &lt;a href="http://www.thenorthface.com/"&gt;The North Face website&lt;/a&gt; (an OpenCms reference site) but it appears to be removed (probably because of a channel conflict with their retail partners). What caught my eye, however, is the amount of momentum OpenCms seems to be having. With two, high impact, big releases (v6 and v7), OpenCms has brought itself back into the limelight after losing mind-share to the new generation of Java based WCM platforms (Magnolia, Jahia, Alfresco). I think adding in-context editing has narrowed the usability gap between OpenCms and the newer products. Other new features like WebDAV have also played a big role. Plus, OpenCms is considerably less expensive (there is no "Enterprise" version to buy. All the revenue comes from support). Support packages from &lt;a href="http://www.alkacon.com/en/"&gt;Alkacon&lt;/a&gt; are relatively inexpensive and provide enough of a safety net to molify the risk averse CIO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you looked at OpenCms a couple of years ago and found it less exciting than its newer peers, you may want to take another look.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content>

    <title>First Magnolia On Air Customer Live</title>
    <content type='html'>It looks like the first customer of &lt;a href="http://www.magnolia-cms.com/onair"&gt;Magnolia's On Air platform&lt;/a&gt; is now live.  &lt;a href="http://www.rsi.ch/home.html"&gt;RTSI&lt;/a&gt; is a Swiss radio and television company.  They are moving to On Air from a home grown system.  Eventually eight stations will be supported on the new platform.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a title="magnolia-onair-arch by sggottlieb, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sggottlieb/3129093136/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3125/3129093136_51d807b260.jpg" alt="magnolia-onair-arch" width="500" height="271" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Architecture diagram showing integration between Media Workflow Engine and Magnolia (please excuse the colors).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For those of you who are not familiar with On Air, it is an integration between &lt;a href="http://www.magnolia-cms.com/home/products/enterprise.html"&gt;Magnolia CMS Enterprise Edition&lt;/a&gt;Â (&lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/products-page/reports/open-source-web-content-management-in-magnolia"&gt;reviewed here&lt;/a&gt;) and a third party product called Media Workflow Engine by FutureLabs.  MWE provides capture, workflow, and advanced (non-destructive) editing functionality for video, audio and images.  Images are represented in the Magnolia repository (the &lt;a href="http://jackrabbit.apache.org"&gt;Apache Jackrabbit&lt;/a&gt; JCR implementation) as proxy objects.  This saves the Magnolia repository from becoming bloated with binary files.  Another nice feature of the integration is that workflows can be initiated in either system and can be continued in the other system.  For example, a visitor uploading a video to a site can kick off a workflow in MWE.</content>

    <title>New White Paper on Open Source Document Management Systems</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;[Unfortunately, this white paper is no longer available without registering with Optaros.  The links in this post no longer work.  If you don't mind being called by one of our nice sales people, follow this &lt;a href="http://www.optaros.com/en/publications/white_papers_reports/unleashing_the_power_of_open_source_in_document_management"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; and register. ]&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My colleague, Sebastian Wohlrapp, and I just published a &lt;a href="http://www.optaros.com/wp/wp_6_os_docManagement.shtml"&gt;new white paper&lt;/a&gt; on Open Source Document Management Systems.  Last year, it seemed that most of what open source content management had to offer was in the WCM and personal publishing space.  A lot has changed and there are now several viable DMS options.  This paper focuses on basic document management functionality needed by the typical knowledge worker as an alternative to what most companies resort to today: shared file systems and email.  There is great potential for open source to answer the need for open/affordable/simple solutions that deliver this functionality.  Several projects are well on their way. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The following projects were evaluated:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.alfresco.org"&gt;Alfresco&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://contineo.sourceforge.net/index.html"&gt;Contineo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cps-project.org/"&gt;CPS (Collaborative Portal Server)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ktdms.com/"&gt;KnowledgeTree&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://owl.sourceforge.net/"&gt;Owl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://plone.org"&gt;Plone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.open-steam.org/"&gt;Open sTeam&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We evaluated the projects along the following dimensions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Creating and storing content&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Organizing content and collaboration&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Search and accessing content&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Usability&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As usual, feedback is welcome.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Alfresco goes all open source</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;If you have read my comments on &lt;a href="http://www.alfresco.org"&gt;Alfresco&lt;/a&gt;, you probably noticed me mention that Alfresco is not all open source.  In fact, I have said the "E" of their ECM was closed source because the features that an enterprise would need (LDAP integration, group based permissioning, etc.) were only available in the for-pay version.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=" http://home.businesswire.com/portal/site/google/index.jsp?ndmViewId=news_view&amp;newsId=20060501005617&amp;newsLang=en"&gt;Alfresco's recent announcement&lt;/a&gt; shows a change in their licensing model which makes the entire code base open source (licensed under the &lt;a href="http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/"&gt;MPL&lt;/a&gt;).  The Enterprise and Community versions will have the same functionality but only the Enterprise version will be certified.  The Community version will be more oriented toward research and development and undergo less QA.  This is similar to the relationship between &lt;a href="http://fedora.redhat.com/"&gt;Fedora&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.redhat.com"&gt;Red Hat Linux Enterprise Linux&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is unclear what the difference in quality and reliability between these two versions will be. Alfresco strongly urges anyone using the software for non-experimental purposes to use the Enterprise version but says the Community version is a great low risk way to try the software and see if it works within your enterprise.  This sounds a little like the ShareWare model but it does give companies the choice to release themselves from paying the Enterprise subscription if they feel like they are not getting the value out of it.  The absence of lock-in is certainly a big benefit.  Who knows, maybe some other company will step up and specialize in supporting the Community version.  Open source is all about choices.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another potential benefit of this move is that it may give a developer community a chance to grow around Alfresco.  Before the licensing change, there was little incentive for an independent developer to contribute code if it could wind up in the for pay version.  If a developer community does take root, the community version could become a viable option for enterprises in much the same way that there are many production servers running Fedora and &lt;a href="http://en.opensuse.org/Welcome_to_openSUSE.org"&gt;openSUSE&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think that this was a necessary step for Alfresco and I am glad that they did it.  The only challenge is how their marketing department will create messaging around the difference.  How will they encourage people to buy the Enterprise version without derogating the Community version?&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Hippo&amp;#39;s New Version Compare Functionality</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Arjé Cahn recently &lt;a href="http://blogs.onehippo.org/arje/2010/03/hippo_cms_74_preview_version_c.html"&gt;screencasted a demonstration of the new version compare functionality that will be released in Hippo CMS version 7.4&lt;/a&gt; (due June 2010).  While (as Arjé concedes) versioning and version compare are nothing new, the Hippo team has added a subtle twist that I think makes a vast improvement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When an approver is reviewing a change to &lt;em&gt;a previously approved&lt;/em&gt; asset, &lt;a href="http://www.onehippo.com/en/products/cms"&gt;Hippo CMS&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;defaults&lt;/em&gt; to a version compare view.  Adds, changes, and deletes are highlighted by color and strikethrough (see screenshot).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.onehippo.org/arje/2010/03/hippo_cms_74_preview_version_c.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.onehippo.org/arje/2010/03/19/Screen%20shot%202010-03-19%20at%205.13.49%20PM.png"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The concept reminds me of source code control system commit emails that highlight changes to code whenever anyone checks anything in (&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sggottlieb/4473432942/sizes/o/"&gt;click on screenshot&lt;/a&gt; for a larger view).  I do a lot of web development team mentorship and I have come to rely commit emails.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sggottlieb/4473432942/sizes/o/" title="SVN Commit Example by sggottlieb, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2796/4473432942_db9e7d5963.jpg" width="500" height="82" alt="SVN Commit Example" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They allow me to quickly determine if there are any material changes that I need to dig into and saves me loads of time (in the case of the screenshot example, no important changes have been made).  I am wondering if the Hippo implementation adds excerpts of changes in their workflow notification emails.  That would be convenient.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I really like the Hippo team's pragmatic approach to enhancing Hippo CMS.  Rather than adding lots of a new &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2005/01/selecting-a-cms-with-narratives.html"&gt;"checklist" features&lt;/a&gt; (that make the product more complicated), they tend to focus on refining and streamlining functionality that customers probably already use.  It is that "&lt;a href="http://www.codesimplicity.com/post/suck-less/"&gt;make it suck less&lt;/a&gt;" philosophy that makes software continuously better for the users but tends not to get recognized by most analysts and buyers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep up the good work Hippo!&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Eric Barroca Debunking Commercial Open Source Myths</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://www.nuxeo.com/en/"&gt;Nuxeo&lt;/a&gt; CEO Éric Barroca has an excellent post that &lt;a href="http://blogs.nuxeo.com/ebarroca/2009/08/commercial-open-source-or-just-a-free-demo.html"&gt;breaks down the hype and decodes the marketing speak around commercial open source software&lt;/a&gt;. He doesn't name names but he does call out some of the claims and language of some commercial open source vendors.  The general message is this: software vendors should focus on making great products and be clear and direct about what they are selling. There is nothing wrong with selling proprietary software or charging license fees &amp;mdash; just be clear about it.  Don't call a license fee something else to give the appearance that the software is free.  Éric also gives a lot of credit to commercial software vendors that contribute to open source (like Atlassian, Day, and IBM) without making a big deal about it.</content>

    <content type='html'>Just some small corrections about (Mambo)Joomla:&lt;br&gt;1. &amp;quot;...most of the core developers forking the code base to create Joomla...&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;Not most, ALL!&lt;br&gt;2. &amp;quot;In-site editing is sufficient to make textual changes and is foolproof but does not give access to metadata and advanced publicashing features.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;Wrong, you must&amp;#39;ve missed the tabs under the text entry fields..&lt;br&gt;3. &amp;quot;Other visitor-facing functionality, ... can be added by downloading and installing modules (called mambots) through the management user interface&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;A bit of a mix up here, modules, mambots and components are 3 very different extension possibilities for the Core code. Modules are side blocks, mambots modify main content output before display, and components provide additional functionality such as you describe. For a more in-depth description of each, please refer to the Glossary: http://help.joomla.org/component/option,com_glossary/Itemid,213/&lt;br&gt;Hope this helps ;)&lt;br&gt;Joe</content>

    <title>Drupal v. Plone</title>
    <content type='html'>There is a good &lt;a href="http://drupal.org/node/13733"&gt;discussion&lt;/a&gt; on the Drupal site comparing Plone and Drupal.  Many of the contributors have experience with both systems and the general consensus is that Drupal is good to quickly stand up small sites and Plone is better for larger more complicated content management initiatives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a summary of the comments:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Plone is an enterprise-grade CMS that can support complicated workflow and permissioning and high traffic volumes.  Drupal is targeted for smaller sites.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Drupal's LAMP based architecture is more open than Plone's Zope (all in one application server and database).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Python is higher performing and more object oriented, but more difficult to learn than PHP.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Plone has fewer but more polished releases than Drupal&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Drupal's UI is very intuitive and requires little training&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content>

    <title>Rediscovering Private Chat</title>
    <content type='html'>A few weeks ago, I moved my development team from Skype to HipChat for chat-based collaboration. &amp;nbsp;All the buzz around this new breed of collaboration services (such as HipChat, Slack, and Flowdock) was making me curious. &amp;nbsp;I had used private chat room technology like IRC and Jabber in the past with mixed results. &amp;nbsp;I also used to work for a company that made a product called &lt;a href="https://mindalignhub.aditi.com/"&gt;MindAlign (which looks like it has been frozen in time since 2004)&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;In every case, these services were initially popular and then people drifted away to other tools such as AOL Instant Messenger (AIM), Yahoo! Instant Messenger (YIM), Microsoft Messenger, and Skype. &amp;nbsp;People preferred consumer chat services because you can also use them to communicate with your non-work friends. Nobody wants to run more software on their computer than they need to. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Times have changed. YIM and AIM are basically irrelevant only to be replaced by tools like Apple Messages, WhatsApp, and Viber. &amp;nbsp;But I think that there are bigger differences in play.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
Smartphones have conditioned us to multiple channels&lt;/h3&gt;
Now pretty much everyone runs at least two computers: a workstation on our desk and a personal computer in our pocket (our smartphone). &amp;nbsp;These two computers have different roles. &amp;nbsp;Your workstation is very clearly for work and your smartphone is focused on digital communications. &amp;nbsp;The smartphone has the best chat network of all (SMS because it is ubiquitous) and it is easier to use now that we have a keyboard. &amp;nbsp; The new chat services (WhatsApp, Viber, Apple Messages, Facebook Messenger) are all focused on the smartphone market. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Chat-based collaboration tools like HipChat don't have to compete with personal messaging services. It is easier for them to coexist because they live on separate devices.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
Twitter and Facebook have built new habits&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
Twitter and Facebook have had a major impact on how we consume information. &amp;nbsp;We are now much better at handling rapidly flowing feeds of information. &amp;nbsp;We are less intimidated by the volume and we have built habits around scanning back since we last checked. &amp;nbsp;As senders we have built habits around posting things multiple times for people who access different stretches of the timeline.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
These skills make it easier to handle group chat services like IRC and now HipChat/Slack/Flowdock.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
Integrations make chat collaboration tools more powerful&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
I know that IRC bots have been around for ages but the new breed of chat-collaboration tools have an amazing collection of integrations. &amp;nbsp;After setting up HipChat, it was really easy to hook in the other tools that we use: Bitbucket, Codeship, and ZenDesk. &amp;nbsp;Now that I am better at handling feeds, it is nice to have all of these notifications in one place other than my email inbox. &amp;nbsp;My hope is that email can be used less for notifications and just for messages that I need to respond to. &amp;nbsp; That may drive email volume down.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
Why change?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
As a distributed team that does better with written communication than voice, we rely heavily on chat. &amp;nbsp;Skype was good for 1 on 1 chats but not so great for group chats because it is difficult to get back into a group chat and scan the latest if you closed the window. &amp;nbsp;With HipChat, many of the conversations that used to be 1 on 1 are in an open forum and there is an open invitation to eavesdrop and chime in. &amp;nbsp;It feels a lot more like an office where people are co-located. &amp;nbsp; We even greet each other when we log on.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
But the biggest win is in the integrations. &amp;nbsp;Part of that is having notifications in one shared space. &amp;nbsp;It's like an &lt;a href="https://www.atlassian.com/wallboards/information-radiators.jsp"&gt;information radiator&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;in a physical office. &amp;nbsp;Everyone can see it and, when something changes, everyone can talk about it. &amp;nbsp;For example, when we get a ZenDesk ticket notification, everyone sees it at the same time and we can chat about who is going to take it and how to resolve it. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But there is more to it than centralization. &amp;nbsp;I feel the incentive to write better Git commit messages when I know they will go into the stream. &amp;nbsp;People are naturally more thorough and provide more context when writing for a larger audience. &amp;nbsp;Then, if our continuous integration system (Codeship) raises an error, everyone in the room can get complete context of what the code change was, who did it, and the thinking behind it. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A chat collaboration service like HipChat (or others) has huge advantages over tools like Skype. &amp;nbsp;It is especially helpful for us because we are a distributed team; but even in a co-located work environment, chat collaboration could bring the benefits of an open floor plan without the &lt;a href="http://www.inc.com/jessica-stillman/open-plan-offices-are-crazy.html"&gt;downside&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;If you really want to focus on something, you can mute the conversation by shutting down the app and catch up when you come back up for air. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Predictive Analytics for Marketing</title>
    <content type='html'>As a consumer, the article "&lt;a href="http://cmo.com/content/cmo-com/home/articles/2013/3/20/predictive_analytics.html"&gt;Predictive Analytics: The Power Behind Next-Gen Marketing&lt;/a&gt;"  sounds very encouraging.  To date, most marketing technology has focused on increasing the capacity of marketing departments: more marketing emails, automated interactions ..., which leads to a marketing strategy of throwing more at the consumer and looking for response.   Unfortunately, the most likely response a marketing organization is going to see is disengagement. After all, it is much easier to see an unsubscription than a conversion - particularly in a traditional business where details about purchase information are difficult to get.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At first this is going to feel invasive.  We hate the industry examples that the author presents (particularly credit scoring and health insurance); but I am hoping that predictive analytics will help marketers target their message to receptive customers who can genuinely benefit from the product or service.  Maybe this science will even help companies discontinue programs that nobody would want.</content>

    <title>Plone Strategic Planning Session</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;[Added links to Jon and Alex's blogs]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am heading back home from Mountain View after spending a day at the Plone Strategic Planning Session where 50 Plonistas are meeting for three days at the Google campus to discuss the future of Plone. Kudos to the Plone Community for proactively thinking about growth and improvement when things are going well for Plone. Too often these discussions happen during crisis when options and opportunities are limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday (day one) focused on "marketing" and today is about technology. Tomorrow attendees will organize the action items that came out of the first two days. &lt;a href="http://blogs.onenw.org/jon/"&gt;Jon Stahl&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="http://onenw.com/"&gt;One/Northwest&lt;/a&gt; did a wonderful job of organizing the event and directing the sessions (he even got a Kentuckian to "twinkle" - you had to be there). The Plone community is lucky to have leaders like Jon. That Jon comes from a non-technical background shows how the Plone community has been able to attract, engage, and leverage non-technical people. Plone co-founder &lt;a href="http://limi.net/"&gt;Alexander Limi&lt;/a&gt;'s assertion that he is not a technologist (although he is a closet geek) has helped the Plone culture be more inviting to non-technologists and give them pathways to leadership. This aspect of the Plone community is somewhat rare in open source software (and most commercial software too). I would say that the closest thing is in the &lt;a href="htt://joomla.org" title="Joomla!"&gt;Joomla!&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://drupal.org/"&gt;Drupal&lt;/a&gt; communities that have active marketplaces for designers to sell and share themes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biggest issue that the group struggled with is the one that confounds the whole content management industry: is a CMS a framework or a product? This came up a number of times in pre-conference blog posts and email threads as well as during exercises like composing elevator pitches. The elevator pitch exercise turned up another industry-wide puzzle: what is content management? I, personally, dislike the term content management. "Content" is too vague and "Management" (in my mind) is a negative word (guess who works for himself). "Content Management" implies that content is a liability and needs to be controlled. It sounds too much like "Waste Management" or "Risk Management." However, it is convenient that the term is widely known and immediately brings about a sense of understanding. Alas, I digress. Back to Plone...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was a good discussion about competitors and differentiators. Drupal, &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/sharepoint/default.mspx" title="Microsoft Sharepoint"&gt;Microsoft Sharepoint&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.alfresco.com/" title="Alfresco"&gt;Alfresco&lt;/a&gt; were identified as the biggest threats. From an emotional perspective, Drupal got the greatest amount of attention because the long-standing rivalry and that Drupal has been so successful in the non-profit sector where may of the Plonistas work. Alfresco and Sharepoint are newer and the Plone community is still learning about where they fit in. Plone has a broad set of uses and both of these products certainly encroach on some of the territory that Plone has marked out. Sharepoint, is very compelling for intranets and collaboration. Aggressive pricing by Microsoft, especially for non-profits, trims Plone's edge on total cost of ownership. However, Sharepoint is not a good answer for building traditional websites where Plone is effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joomla!, Drupal and low-end commercial tools like Expression Engine, City Desk and Adobe Contribute are the obvious competitors for building basic websites. In order to reach the broad, low-end market, a theming community and a shallower learning curve would help Plone. Open source products that were noticeably absent from the discussion were &lt;a href="http://typo3.org/" title="TYPO3"&gt;TYPO3&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://ez.no/"&gt;eZ Publish.&lt;/a&gt; Although less so in North America, TYPO3 has a nice network of agency style consultancies that can efficiently build highly branded websites on the platform. TYPO3's default install with all of the back-end modules enabled makes the product easy to dismiss as complex and ugly. But most TYPO3 customers see TYPO3 only after it has been tailored to their needs. eZ Publish has the advantage of commercial style support options and productized bundles that are targeted to different market segments and industry verticals. Both of these qualities would help Plone be more accessible to a broader market of buyers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alfresco was also on the radar and there are good reasons why the Plone community should be paying attention to it. While Plone's out of the box user interface is much more refined than Alfresco's, Alfresco has a number of architectural features that make it a better general content management framework. Alfresco's repository services are more open and advanced than Plone's and most large companies developing custom web applications will be better equipped to build and support them in Java than in Python and Zope. I think that Plone's Zope architecture will frequently qualify Plone out of large corporations that think of the world in terms of "Microsoft" and "Java." There was an acknowledgement that large, established IT departments tend to be hostile to Plone and chances are better when business owners run the selection process. That is not to say that very large companies have not successfully deployed Plone in important content management scenarios. Just look at &lt;a href="http://www.novell.com/"&gt;Novell&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://www.cia.gov/"&gt;CIA&lt;/a&gt;. There are also some other big companies that are in the process of major Plone deployments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many within the Plone community feel that there are better Python frameworks for building general web applications so maybe this is an area that Plone should not try to compete in. The general consensus is that Plone developers should try to integrate with other applications as much as possible rather than build everything on Plone. I am sure that they are talking about technical tactics for enabling integration strategies today during the technical session. I would expect that there will be a discussion about better mechanisms for creating and consuming RESTful APIs and strategies for replicating content out of the ZODB.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am really happy that I attended the Plone Strategic Planning Session. It was good to see the Plone community in action working together to solve difficult questions. It will be interesting to see how these ideas get distilled into a strategy that is easy to organize behind. More important, however, will be how the Plone community is able to execute this strategy.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>A study that I would really like to see</title>
    <content type='html'>Recently I have been helping a client establish standards for software development and configuration management. The developers are all very excited about instituting practices like unit testing, code reviews, and continuous integration but there is concern whether the pressure and pace of development would allow for taking the time to things right. Despite the fact that management brought me in to establish these practices, there is doubt as to whether the business could abstain from setting unrealistic expectations that force hurried work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So the big question is - does doing things the "right" way take longer and jeopardize short term deadlines? I think the conventional wisdom is that process investment starts to pay off toward the end of the project or in subsequence releases of the system. But when is the break even point? I have heard lots of claims but very little hard data - mainly because it is impossible to compare different projects because no two projects are alike. I think the only way to get evidence that is even close to conclusive is to do a study like the following.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take a large group of under graduate computer science majors and randomly assign them to three independent classes taught by the same professor. The course work for the semester is a series of software development projects to build an application where each project builds on the previous project. Each class gets the same projects. None of the classes has visibility as to what the next project will be or what the other classes are doing. All students track time spent on the projects. The different classes are instructed as follows:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Class A&lt;/strong&gt; is given very aggressive deadlines and is graded solely on how well the application meets the requirements.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Class B&lt;/strong&gt; is given less aggressive deadlines and is graded on development standards (unit tests, configuration management, and code structure and style) as well as the application's satisfaction of the requirements.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Class C&lt;/strong&gt; is given the same deadlines as Class B but is only graded on the same criteria as Class A.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the test, you compare the time spent by the three classes and the overall quality of the three applications (defect rate, adherence to the requirements, etc.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If widely considered best practices in software development are as effective as believed, Class B will end the semester with the best software and the least stress. Class A will be totally stressed and their application will be barely hanging together. I would guess that Class C starts the semester off breezing through and enjoying their free time but has to do a bit of cramming in the end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Has anyone seen or done a study like this?</content>

    <title>Blogging: Alive or Dead?</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Paul Boutin's Wired article &lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/entertainment/theweb/magazine/16-11/st_essay"&gt;"Twitter, Flickr, Facebook Make Blogs Look So 2004"&lt;/a&gt; last year created a lively dialog about the future of blogging.  The general gist of the article (in case you haven't read it) is that mainstream media companies have adopted and started to dominate the blog format while independent bloggers have drifted into the even more casual and spontaneous domain of "status updates."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Independent bloggers do tend to let their productivity ebb and flow and I am sure that many of the "citizen journalists" who were really flowing during the blogging peak are seriously ebbing right now.  I agree with Boutin that blogging is no longer the primary way that people casually share ideas. Now, when I run across some interesting information I have three choices.  I can &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net"&gt;blog it&lt;/a&gt;, I can &lt;a href="http://delicious.com/sggottlieb"&gt;bookmark it&lt;/a&gt;, or I can &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/sggottlieb"&gt;tweet it&lt;/a&gt;.  My general rule of thumb is: when I have something to add, I blog it; when I just want to save it for later (perhaps with a little note), I bookmark it in Delicious (or star it in &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/reader"&gt;Google Reader&lt;/a&gt;); when I just want to tell my friends, I tweet it.  All of my stuff goes into &lt;a href="http://friendfeed.com/sggottlieb"&gt;FriendFeed&lt;/a&gt; where occasionally people comment and add their own ideas.  I imagine other bloggers' productivity is similarly diluted across these other channels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But Boutin's trend is going even further.  There was a great article in the New York Times that described how &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/28/arts/television/28twit.html?ref=media"&gt;television journalists are getting addicted to Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;a href="http://scobleizer.com/"&gt;Robert Scoble&lt;/a&gt; has created his own format on &lt;a href="http://friendfeed.com"&gt;FriendFeed&lt;/a&gt; where he starts an item with something like "&lt;a href="http://friendfeed.com/e/e1de389e-387d-43b1-b484-0ed93c5cf4ed/Why-Twitter-is-not-for-conversations-I-will-give/"&gt;Why Twitter is not for conversations. I will give you five reasons here:&lt;/a&gt;" and then goes on to list them in the comments.  As he adds items, everyone else chimes in with their opinions.  The result is a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossfire_(TV_series)"&gt;Crossfire&lt;/a&gt;-like discussion but without the interruptions (and, thankfully, without Tucker Carlson).  In this case, he gave 5 reasons out of a total of 158 comments and another 143 people "liked" the post.  In these cases the journalist moves from commentator to facilitator or catalyst.  But, while this format is very dynamic and has lots of energy, it lacks the authority of a single person summarizing and interpreting the information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To really develop an idea into a cohesive viewpoint, you may not need to write a 1,400 word exposÃ© but you do need more than 140 characters (FriendFeed allows you more but most people don't use more than 140).  And for that type of communication the blog format is very well suited because you have the room to elaborate on your point and you still offer a place for others to make their own comments.  Blogging is not going away.  If anything, it is displacing the formal article as the preferred format for journalists who appreciate the more intimate relationship with their reading audience that comes with immediate publishing and user submitted comments.  My feed reader relentlessly fills up with new content every day so I can't complain about not having enough to read.  If anything, I feel like the overall quality of the blogosphere is going up.  Blogging isn't dying, it is just maturing.  And with maturity, comes sophistication (at least that is what I tell myself).&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>New Article on ECM</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;My article on ECM for &lt;a href="http://www.cutter.com/itjournal/"&gt;Cutter IT Journal&lt;/a&gt; just came out and is available &lt;a href="http://www.cutter.com/offers/contentmanagement.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  I am sorry to say that you have to register on the website to read it but there is a no email option if you are worried about the spam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The thesis of the article is that the ECM vision of having one centralized CMS to manage all kinds of content is dead - or at least misguided.  Instead, companies are looking at ways to integrate best of breed CMS solutions into a more federated architecture that shares content.  If you read it, I would love to hear your feedback: sgottlieb (at) optaros.com&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Open Source WCM in Java</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;IT'S HERE!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am very happy to announce the availability of Content Here's first report: &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/products-page/reports/open-source-content-management-in-java"&gt;Open Source Web Content Management in Java&lt;/a&gt;. The report is written for technical decision makers and covers &lt;a href="http://www.alfresco.com/" title="Alfresco"&gt;Alfresco&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://lenya.apache.org/" title="Apache Lenya"&gt;Apache Lenya&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://cocoondev.org/daisy/index.html" title="Daisy CMS"&gt;Daisy CMS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.hippocms.org/display/CMS/Hippo+CMS+Home" title="Hippo CMS"&gt;Hippo CMS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.jahia.org/jahia/home.html" title="Jahia"&gt;Jahia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.magnolia.info/en/magnolia.html" title="Magnolia"&gt;Magnolia&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.opencms.org/en/" title="OpenCms"&gt;OpenCms&lt;/a&gt; with a level of detail that I have not yet seen in a professional analyst report on open source software. Each 15+ page evaluation describes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;the history of the project&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the architecture and how it can be extended&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;how the contribution interfaces behave and how they can be customized&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;how the system can be administered, configured, and integrated&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;how the presentation tier works and what can be done with it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;what the community and other support structures are like&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is enough technical meat for an architect to understand the product and consider it for prototyping. By focusing on the "content contribution" and "presentation" sections of each evaluation, semi-technical readers will see how they would use the system to meet their needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Systems integration firms, software companies, and investors will also find &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Open Source Web Content Management in Java&lt;/span&gt; useful for understanding the open source WCM marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The products are organized into two groups: products that are typically used to power basic informational sites, and products that are used more as frameworks for more complex web applications. For each category, I describe important features that the product should support and rate each of the products in those functional areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/about/pr-announce-jwcm1-0.php"&gt;Press release&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/products-page/reports/open-source-content-management-in-java"&gt;Product detail page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://media.contenthere.net/articles/jwcm-workgroup-1.0-sample.pdf" title="Open Source WCM in Java Sample"&gt;Sample&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>30 CMS Signatures on CM Field Guide</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Last Friday &lt;a href="http://about.me/jeroenreijn"&gt;Jeroen Reijn&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="http://www.onehippo.com/"&gt;Hippo&lt;/a&gt; submitted the 30th CMS signature for the &lt;a href="https://github.com/sggottlieb/cmfieldguide"&gt;CM Field Guide project.&lt;/a&gt;  If this is your first time hearing of CM Field Guide, it is a community project to share clues for telling what CMS a website is running.  For more background, here is my &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2012/05/cm-field-guide-social-coding-for-cms-geeks.html"&gt;CM Field Guide announcement blog post&lt;/a&gt;. Here is the list so far:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Adobe CQ&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Concrete5&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;li&gt;DemandWare&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;li&gt;dotCMS&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;li&gt;DotNetNuke&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Drupal&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Ektron&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Elcom CMS&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;li&gt;EPiServer&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;li&gt;ExpressionEngine&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;li&gt;eZ Publish&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Hannon Hill Cascade Server&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Hippo CMS&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;li&gt;iApps&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Ingeniux&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Joomla!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Kentico&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Liferay&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Magnolia&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;li&gt;ModX&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Octopress&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;li&gt;OpenText (RedDot)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Plone&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;li&gt;SharePoint&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;li&gt;SilverStripe&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Sitecore&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Tridion&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Umbraco&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Websphere Commerce&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Wordpress&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other contributors include Adriaan Bloem (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/#!/adriaanbloem"&gt;@adriaanbloem&lt;/a&gt;), Steven Brent (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/#!/stevenbrent"&gt;@stevenbrent&lt;/a&gt;), Timothy Davis (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/#!/timothydavis"&gt;@timothydavis&lt;/a&gt;), Lee Roberson (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/#!/lroberson"&gt;@lroberson&lt;/a&gt;), Robb Winkle (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/#!/robbwinkle"&gt;@robbwinkle&lt;/a&gt;), Wes Winham (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/#!/weswinham"&gt;@weswinham&lt;/a&gt;) and of course, the guy who started it all, Deane Barker (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/#!/gadgetopia"&gt;@gadgetopia&lt;/a&gt;).  If you know of any secrets for sniffing a CMS, let me know and I will add it and create you an account so you can use the www.cmfieldguide.com website.  If you like to code Python and Django, you can code it yourself and submit a pull request on github.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>OpenCMS Version 6.0 Released</title>
    <content type='html'>The &lt;a href="http://www.opencms.org"&gt;OpenCMS Project&lt;/a&gt; recently officially released version 6.0.0 of OpenCMS.  Version 6 has been in beta for some time and I have been waiting for the official "gold" release.  Some of the new features that 6.0 introduces:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;In-site editing.  This is where users with edit permissions are able to edit content directly on the presentation side of the site, rather than just through the management interface.  If you have read some of my other mail and blog posts, you may know that I have mixed feelings about this design.  On the plus side, it makes the system more intuitive because users are able to edit the site directly.  On the negative side, this kind of feature reduces the potential for reuse and more dynamic presentation logic.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;New content types.  This is a huge improvement over the last version.  Version 5.x only had one content type: pages.  This leads to unstructured content and poor separation of content and layout reducing the potential to reuse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Full text search of attachments (MS Word)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Improved permissioning&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OpenCMS the most mature and polished of the Java based open source CMS.  With this release, OpenCMS improves its versatility and increases its potential as an enterprise ready CMS.</content>

    <title>Microsoft may be regaining interest in MCMS</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I just read on CMS Watch that Microsoft may be re-energizing their efforts behind MCMS.  The news comes from a presentation made by Mark Harrison (see &lt;a href="http://markharrison.co.uk/blog/2004/12/mcms-reloaded.htm"&gt;blog entry&lt;/a&gt; for slides) which indicates MCMS 2002 will coexist and integrate with SharePoint.   The slides also reference the vibrant community of add-on providers including Artemis's Open Source MCMS.Rapid solution which creates a starter site that can be used to kickstart MCMS development.  However, I would expect Microsoft to cannibalize any worthy innovation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a mention of special solutions for industry verticals (a theme that I have been hearing a lot in the CMS space).  Currently there are solutions being developed for municipalities and health care&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Keynote Themes from Gilbane</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;The first day of the &lt;a href="http://www.gilbane.com/CM_conference_Boston_04.html"&gt;Gilbane Conference&lt;/a&gt; had a very interesting Keynote panel of industry analysts who focus on Content Management technologies. The panelists were:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Steven Ashley, Senior VP, Research from Baird &amp; Co.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Joshua Duhl, Research Director of Content Management from IDC&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hadley Reynolds, Vice President &amp;amp; Research Director from Delphi&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kyle McNabb, Senior analyst from Forrester Research&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Alan Pelz-Sharpe, Vice President, North America from Ovum&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The panelists were asked to speak for 5 minutes on something that they think the audience should know about trends and direction of ECM. Here were the highlights....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joshua Duhl kicked it off with the bold statement that ECM is a myth. There has been a big consolidation of companies (and their capabilities) and there is more the come. Vendors will say that they have it all working together but they don't. This idea was echoed by Alan Pelz-Sharpe who said that companies have so many forms of content and processes that it is unrealistic and impractical to manage it all within one system. On the other side, Kyle McNabb said that it is very real and focused on the idea of "one throat to choke." In the Q&amp;A there was a similar topic about best of breed vs. ECM. Kyle McNabb's recommended big ECM vendors who have complete solutions with best of breed components. It think the general consensus was that ECM is a vision (not a product) worth pursuing for some companies if the cost/benefit is right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steven Ashley, who focuses on financial analysis of CM companies, made the point that all the money has been, and continues to be, in Document Management. He pointed to three huge deals that FileNet made ($10MM, $9MM, and $8MM). He said that Documentum is doing equally well. Oracle and Micorsoft are preparing to compete heavily in this area. The interesting thing is that an informal audience poll said that most of the audience was focused on Web Content Management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most companies under budget their CM initiatives. They should expect to spend 2 to 3 times the license cost on services. The established ECM players will have an advantage in integration costs over the platform players (Oracle and Microsoft)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Other interesting points&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pretty much everyone agreed on Alan Pelz-Sharpe's point that no one wants to do compliance. Customers just see it as a cost with no upside.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;The analysts on the panel had no interest in Open Source CMS. The topic did not come up until one of the audience (not me) asked the question. Alan Pelz-Sharpe said that he did a little research into the market and found that some of the Web Content Management products were pretty good and may present a good deal for small to mid size companies. Generally the analysts didn't follow them and avoided recommending them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am not sure if I heard him right but I think that Joshua Duhl made the point that Microsoft did not offer a content management system. I was surprised because it was such a huge topic last year (remember, Microsoft bought NCompass and started selling it as Microsoft Content Management Server). I talked to a couple friends in the vendor community and learned that MS has basically done nothing with the product since purchasing it and all the buzz is around SharePoint and their document management solutions. Is Microsoft stepping away from their Content Management Server product?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content>

    <title>Text Killed the Multi-Media Star</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Recently it occurred to me that video and (to some extent audio) has become a less important requirement for most of my web content management clients these days.  If I were to extrapolate the interest trend I was seeing back in 2004, I would expect to see the web resemble billions of tiny television stations.  But that hasn't happened.  While video and audio remain important for companies in the business of developing and/or distributing multi-media content (primarily for entertainment), multi-media has not achieved ubiquity as a medium for communication. Instead, the focus is still heavily weighted towards text and images.  There are some obvious explanations for this trend. Services like YouTube, Vimeo, and BrightCove are taking care of video hosting so my clients don't have to worry about it.  Also, companies have realized that, other than the large file sizes, video is just not so special that deserves so much special concern and attention.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I think that there are larger forces at work.  I experience issues with video both as a content consumer and a content management professional.  As a content consumer, I don't like how video takes control over my experience of the information.  Unlike text, you can't scan video for the little bit information that you want.  You have to sit back and wait for the video to get to the point.  This is great for entertainment (suspense!) but less so for information exchange.  Take, for example, this video (below) where the spokesman just spurts out technical information about a computer.  It would be so much better just to have a spec sheet so you could scan right to the part of the specification you want.  For a while it seemed like all companies were looking to make their websites more "dynamic" by leveraging multi-media.  Customers may have reacted positively at first to the novelty of seeing moving pictures but I think this has played out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;object width="640" height="385"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/Bw_K0zx-Yug&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/Bw_K0zx-Yug&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="640" height="385"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a content management professional, my issue with video is that it breaks a key principle of content management: the separation between content and format.  In video and audio, the information is inseparable from the format.  Yes, you can transcode into different encodings and file formats, but reorganizing and editing audio and video is difficult to automate.  As a result, video and audio content gets stale and out of date because it is too expensive to change.  If you want to change the information, you need to re-produce the whole thing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are some things that belong in audio and video, like a recording of some performance or something that you need motion to understand.  But in most cases, the production and maintenance effort that multi-media requires introduces an unnecessary barrier between the information source and consumer.  This obstacle stands out even more in the social web that tries to blur the line between author and audience.  In the social web, video is most successful when it is short, entertaining, and performance-oriented.  It is less effective for basic information exchange.  The best uses of video I have seen for information exchange is on some news sites where visitors are invited to upload short videos of their eye-witness account.  In these cases, the video needs to be authentic (no need to edit!) and shows something that cannot be captured in text and still images.   But information about that event is more accessible in plain text.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am sure that there are people in the video field that have different experiences with the medium.  If you have any insights, please leave a comment or send me an email.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Nuxeo CPS Switching to Java</title>
    <content type='html'>Stefane Fermigier from &lt;a href="http://www.nuxeo.com"&gt;Nuxeo&lt;/a&gt; just announced on the CPS user list that Nuxeo is switching over from Python/Zope to Java technologies.  Here is the content of the email:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hi all,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;here is an announcement that will come as a surprise: Nuxeo is switching to Java technologies for its upcoming product line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you know (http://blogs.nuxeo.com/sections/blogs/eric_barroca/2006_04_26_open-source-ecm-cps-platform-4-yellowcake-teaser), we have started 6 months ago to include Java technologies into CPS. This solution is satisfactory for our current needs, but we need to think about the future. We had started to study several technological options for CPS' future, including comparing the progressive migration to Zope 3 (the path we had chosen initially) with a 100% pure Java option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our final analysis is that switching to Java, if you take into account the respective maturities of the Java EE open source and Zope 3 platforms, will be easier and provide more value than a switch to Zope 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We also think that with Java 5, modern IDEs like Eclipse, and with all the open source ecosystem that has appeared on Java since the last 5 years, it is much more enjoyable to develop in Java than it used to be 5 years ago when we started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have discussed this choice with some of our partners and customers, and they all support us in this decision. Jean-Marc Orliaguet has also agreed with this strategy, has started porting CPSSkins to Java, and will join us next week in Paris for a sprint on the Web part of the project.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next version of CPS will be called "Nuxeo 5". You will find there all the key features of CPS, a modern architecture based on extensible components and services, and scalability and integration options that were not possible with a "pure Python" architecture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please check the following FAQ:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nuxeo.org/about/java-switch"&gt;http://www.nuxeo.org/about/java-switch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the roadmap for the project:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nuxeo.org/about/roadmap"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.nuxeo.org/about/roadmap&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More information:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The new webste: http://www.nuxeo.org/&lt;br /&gt;- The code base: http://svn.nuxeo.org/trac/nuxeo&lt;br /&gt;- The developers mailing list: http://lists.nuxeo.com/mailman/listinfo/ecm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you would like to join us in this new endeavor, please join the list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to stay in the Zope world, it's your legitimate right and a sensible choice if CPS (or other Zope-based platforms) fit 100% of your needs. The CPS mailing lists will stay open and our team is still available for the time we will keep on supporting CPS, that is 3 years (at least).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have questions, please start by reading the FAQ.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, hopefully, for your support.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  S.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is really interesting news.  Nuxeo CPS is very popular in France and Nuxeo has made large contributions to the Zope community and had grand plans for Zope 3 with their &lt;a href="http://www.z3lab.org/sections/front-page/announcements/zope3-ecm-project"&gt;Z3ECM project&lt;/a&gt;.  This move appears to come from left field.  CPS is a very mature project with a solid install base.  The port to Java is going to be very disruptive.  It is possible that Nuxeo was feeling pressure from &lt;a href="http://www.alfresco.com"&gt;Alfresco&lt;/a&gt;.  Nuxeo was justifiably irritated when &lt;a href="http://www.alfresco.com"&gt;Alfresco&lt;/a&gt; jumped into the marketplace claiming to be the first open source ECM out there when CPS had been out there for years and actually was delivering on the different aspects of ECM: web content management, document management, digital asset management.  CPS is still well ahead of Alfresco when it comes to non-file based functionality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So does this mean that "Enterprise" is just a synonym for "Java?"  My experience is that many large organizations have standardized on Java and are uncomfortable about shaking things up.  Alternative technologies (PHP, Python, Ruby) appear to be acceptable for new, experimental, or experimental initiatives but less so for core services like how a company manages its internal assets.  I am wondering if Nuxeo was getting that kind of feedback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;[Note: All companies do not think this way.  Thankfully, companies like &lt;a href="http://www.google.com"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://37signals.com"&gt;37signals&lt;/a&gt; don't.  Otherwise, they would not be able to innovate at the pace that they do.  But this does seem to be the opinion of the majority of companies that try to stay away from the bleeding edge.]&lt;/b&gt;</content>

    <title>Book Review: Professional Plone Development</title>
    <content type='html'>I just finished Martin Aspeli's &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1847191983?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=contenthere-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1847191983"&gt;Professional Plone Development&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=contenthere-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1847191983" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /&gt;.  This is the third &lt;a href="http://plone.org"&gt;Plone&lt;/a&gt; book that I have read over the years and it is definitely the most advanced. Do not take the words "professional" and "development" in the title lightly.  Martin is a brilliant developer with a long history in the Plone project so I would expect nothing less from him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I found most helpful about the book is its coverage of the many new concepts that were introduced in versions 2.5 and 3 of Plone.  If you have been away from Plone for a while, it may be time to check back in. I think the coolest stuff is the incorporation of &lt;a href="http://www.zope.org/Products/Zope3"&gt;Zope 3&lt;/a&gt; constructs.  The overall trend with Zope 3 is to make the platform less monolithic and more modular.  This allows you to use Zope components in everyday Python applications and to use more standard Python programming techniques in Zope applications.  The core Plone community has been energized by these new ideas for a while but they are just now starting to work their way into the mainstream.  If you don't know about these concepts yet, you are starting to fall behind.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering the breadth, complexity, and innovativeness of Plone 3, Martin had a lot of ground to cover.  Still, he was able to provide useful summaries and examples while keeping some semblance of narrative flow (don't get too attached to his case example though. the book frequently wanders away from the example project of a movie theater website).  &lt;em&gt;Professional Plone Development&lt;/em&gt; helps orient readers and prepare them to embrace and leverage the concepts that advanced Plone developers use in successful projects.   Of course, to complete his education, the developer will have to read the source code and other online resources and, of course, learn by doing.  One thing I would like to see more of is references to online documentation (both in-line references and a "further reading" section at the end of each chapter).  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ideal reader of this book is someone who knows his way around Plone and is proficient in Python - perhaps someone who has read &lt;a href="http://blog.contenthere.net/2005/08/plone-live-review.html"&gt;Plone Live&lt;/a&gt; (which is now, unfortunately, pretty outdated - so much for a constantly updating book) and has built a few sites.  This kind of reader will really benefit from Martin's best practices of test-first development and setting up an efficient development environment.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like how Martin de-mystifies the Zope platform which I have always regarded with fear and respect (except when I worked on a project to re-wire Zope to talk to an Oracle database rather than the ZODB: &lt;a href="http://blog.contenthere.net/2005/12/zoracle-part-i-problem.html"&gt;pt1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://blog.contenthere.net/2005/12/zoracle-part-ii-solution.html"&gt;pt2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://blog.contenthere.net/2005/12/zoracle-part-iii-connecting-zope-to.html"&gt;pt3&lt;/a&gt;).  Martin reminds us that Zope is just a bunch of Python modules and it is OK to poke around and modify code to see how things work.  Just remember to set the code back to how you found it or risk angering the mystical Zope spirit :)</content>

    <title>Where is Content Management going?</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Over the past few months, my attention has been on Open Source CMS products. My experience so far is that a lot of the energy in the space is focused on collaborative content management: where the line between readers and contributors is blurred. This makes sense because collaborative content is an "itch" that OSS developers like to scratch. In the OS community, everyone wants to communicate and participate. There is less emphasis on centralized editorial control because the OSS community also has a culture capable of self policing and members genuinely want to add to constructively to the dialog (Don't get me wrong, there are some excellent traditional Open Source CMS products out there). You look at the success of projects like &lt;a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; and you see evidence of this trend. Also, much of the online documentation for Open Source products allows viewers to correct and annotate content (see &lt;a href="http://zope.org/Documentation/Books/ZopeBook/2_6Edition/"&gt;Zope&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/index.php"&gt;PHP&lt;/a&gt; for examples).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inside companies, I am seeing a transition from tightly controlled internal informational resources like knowledge bases to Wiki based systems where anyone to can contribute. By the way, I think this is a huge challenge to the Enterprise Content Management (ECM) trend promoted by commercial CMS where all content is centralized under a single system and taxonomy. &lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/04/11/18/HNgooglecorpblog_1.html"&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is an InfoWorld article describing how Google uses internal blogs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But will it stop at the firewall?  If you read the &lt;a href="http://www.cluetrain.com/"&gt;Cluetrain Manifesto&lt;/a&gt; you might think that this open dialog way may be used for external communications too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what are the implications? It sounds like chaos. Thousands of mini sites with dissonant ideas and information. Sounds like the Internet!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;No control to enforce company policy, messaging, and branding and protect intellectual property. Companies are going to have to come up with new policies for dealing with their empowered populations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Decentralization would make all these enterprise taxonomy efforts a lot harder. With more authors publishing in less formal ways, it is more difficult to enforce tagging and other attempts at organization. If so, search is going to get a lot more important (hmmm... Google.... blogs.... Interesting!). Editors, responsible for maintaining the quality of communications, may feel overwhelmed with all the channels they need to monitor. By the way, I wonder if anyone at ThoughtWorks edits Martin Fowler's &lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; when he talks about ThoughtWorks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vignette's purchase of IntraSpect and their Collaboration Services offering shows commercial ECM reacting. Licensing schemes for some products might need to change for their customers to be able to open up these systems to a wider user base. I wonder if any vendors are or will soon start to offer a Wiki.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type='html'>Hi Seth,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reasons for our choice are more technical than you seem to believe. The main point is that we spent too much time on improving the application server infrastructure and we were not able to integrate seemlessly with the information system of our customers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We think Python is a great language and Zope a great platform for many things. But now, we are beyond the limits of Zope and need to focus on the ECM stack. Moreover the migration from Zope2 to Zope3 is almost has difficult that Zope2 to Java EE. We have chosen Java EE for the infrastructure layer quality and for the offer of high-quality open source components.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Regarding the &amp;quot;Enterprise compliance&amp;quot;, we already have very large customers that are using CPS for critical applications. &amp;quot;Java == Enterprise&amp;quot; perception is not the main reason of this transition (but of course, we have taken this in account).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You can read the &lt;a href="http://www.nuxeo.com/en/java-switch" rel="nofollow"&gt;FAQ&lt;/a&gt; and the documentation available on &lt;a href="http://nuxeo.org/" rel="nofollow"&gt;nuxeo.org&lt;/a&gt;, it&amp;#39;s all explained.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Feel free to ask for more informations,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;EB.</content>

    <title>Anti-Social Business Blowback</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;A couple of days ago I posted how &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2011/09/social-business-revolution-or-differentiator.html"&gt;"going social" will be difficult for most companies&lt;/a&gt;.  Then, what do you know, I get a real-life example.  Just now, I saw this tweet from Bonnie Smalley, A.K.A. Bonniezilla, formerly the voice of "&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/#!/comcastcares"&gt;Comcast Cares&lt;/a&gt;".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sggottlieb/6192888298/" title="Anti-Social Business by sggottlieb, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6171/6192888298_4cca5769e2.jpg" width="401" height="500" alt="Anti-Social Business"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week she was saying:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"Dear Comcast: Thanks for dropping my prescription coverage. That was real nice of you."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sggottlieb/6192915032/" title="Dear Comcast.  Thanks by sggottlieb, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6152/6192915032_52b7fa2ea4.jpg" width="500" height="66" alt="Dear Comcast.  Thanks"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you don't remember Bonnie, she was the one who responded to you on Twitter when you were complaining about &lt;a href="http://www.comcast.com"&gt;Comcast&lt;/a&gt; service.  Now a guy named Bill Gerth has the job.  Before Bonnie, there was Frank Eliason.  Comcast Cares (whether it is  Frank or Bonnie or Bill) cannot do much about any issues but it puts a human face on the company and probably defuses some frustration.  The Comcast Cares crew seems genuinely concerned about the trouble you are experiencing.  I think that Comcast was a pioneer in this area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don't pretend to know the details of what is happening between Bonnie and her former employer.  But I do know this: something happened to turn the former spokesperson into just another customer who sees Comcast as a lifeless corporate entity.  The very opposite of what the Comcast Cares program is trying to achieve.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ironic isn't it&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>OpenEngagement</title>
    <content type='html'>Happy New Year! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just heard about &lt;a href="http://www.openengagement.org/"&gt;OpenEngagement&lt;/a&gt;: a &lt;a href="http://plone.org/"&gt;Plone&lt;/a&gt; bundle designed for the accounting industry.  OpenEngagement provides document and web content management services and has a portal to be used to share documents with clients.  OpenEngagement's revenue model is based on support contracts and a hosted option. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The initiative appears to be backed by &lt;a href="http://www.caseware.com/"&gt;CaseWare&lt;/a&gt;, a provider of specialized assurance and reporting software to support the delivery of accounting services.  There is an &lt;a href="http://www.openengagement.org/GoBetween.html"&gt;integration&lt;/a&gt; with CaseWare's flagship product (&lt;a href="http://www.caseware.com/fsr.asp?surl=%2Fproducts%2Fworkingpapers%2Fdefault%2Easp"&gt;WorkingPapers&lt;/a&gt;) that allows you to browse the document repository from within WorkingPapers. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This seems like a good use of a community based content management project like Plone.  For minimal cost, CaseWare is able to provide their customers (and prospects) with decent content management functionality.  The small to medium accounting firms, which make up a large portion of the accounting industry, are traditionally under served in this area.  The support option is probably very desirable because many of these companies have minimal in house I.T. resources.</content>

    <title>Summize</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;div class="thumbnail"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skitch.com/sggottlieb/ch6q/content-is-not-data-summize"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.skitch.com/20080604-g7arajgnqget2mcg872gg91qy6.preview.jpg" alt="content is not data - Summize" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Lucida Grande, Trebuchet, sans-serif, Helvetica, Arial; font-size: 10px; color: #808080"&gt;Uploaded with &lt;a href="http://plasq.com/"&gt;plasq&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="http://skitch.com"&gt;Skitch&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a follow up to an &lt;a href="http://blog.contenthere.net/2008/06/social-media-traffic-patterns.html"&gt;earlier post about tracking all that chatter happening around content&lt;/a&gt;, I thought I would mention a new(ish) site called &lt;a href="http://summize.com/"&gt;Summize&lt;/a&gt;.  I had heard the name before but never bothered to look.  Then I read this &lt;a href="http://marklogic.blogspot.com/2008/06/find-out-whats-hot-right-now-with.html"&gt;post on Dave Kellog's blog&lt;/a&gt; that described what it is all about.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summize is a search engine for Twitter.  Twitter itself has really weak search engine so this is a welcome service. Summize is pretty cool but I think it falls short of piecing together a conversation about a topic.  Since each tweet is 140 characters or less, tweets can be less meaningful out of context.  For example, if personA tweets "I am trying product X" and someone else says in reply "@personaA I tried it too and it totally sucked,"  Summize probably won't be able to associate the second tweet with the first.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that Summize &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; good for is seeing trendy topics.  For instance, in the screenshot you can see that &lt;a href="http://www.plurk.com"&gt;Plurk&lt;/a&gt; was on the top of the list.  If you religiously follow Twitter, you know that over the last 7 days everyone has been talking about it as a possible successor to Twitter.  If you don't Twitter you wouldn't know a Plurk from a &lt;a href="http://pluck.com/"&gt;Pluck&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendfeed.com"&gt;FriendFeed&lt;/a&gt; does have a search engine and you can subscribe to the results over RSS.  The nice thing about FriendFeed is that you can see comments too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="thumbnail"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skitch.com/sggottlieb/ch66/friendfeed-search-content-is-not-data"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.skitch.com/20080604-mae4b78x9qjficqw98dmeneuiq.preview.jpg" alt="FriendFeed - Search - "content is not data"" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Lucida Grande, Trebuchet, sans-serif, Helvetica, Arial; font-size: 10px; color: #808080"&gt;Uploaded with &lt;a href="http://plasq.com/"&gt;plasq&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="http://skitch.com"&gt;Skitch&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Guardian Hack Days</title>
    <content type='html'>Both the &lt;a href="http://nytimes.com"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/"&gt;Telegraph&lt;/a&gt;  have been innovating on the newsmedia business model by introducing API's that expose their content and services for outside developers to leverage.  Recently &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt; held &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/insideguardian/2008/nov/13/guardian-hack-day"&gt;their "Hack Day at The Guardian"&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To quote:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The concept is simple: take an idea to prototype in a day and then present your work to your colleagues and a panel of judges.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guardian staff and friends participated in this 24 hour code-fest that ended in 90 second presentations in front of a panel.  You can track activity on &lt;a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?max_id=1009571987&amp;page=1&amp;q=+%23ghack1"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and see pictures on &lt;a href="http://flickr.com/search/groups/?q=ghack1&amp;m=pool&amp;s=int&amp;w=918228%40N20&amp;z=t"&gt;Flickr&lt;/a&gt;.  I still don't know who won yet.  I am sure that everyone is a winner :)</content>

    <title>Why CMS Implementations Are Getting More Expensive</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Adriaan Bloem is starting to hear &lt;a href="http://www.realstorygroup.com/Blog/2176-Implementation-Cost-Multipliers"&gt;both customers and vendors estimate implementation costs to be 7-8 times software licensing costs&lt;/a&gt;.  That is a big increase over the old budgeting rule of thumb which was 4-5 times licensing fees.  I am not saying that there was a sudden increase, but I had been holding onto that old number for a long time so the new number came as a bit of a shock.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My immediate reaction was to try to explain the increase and I thought I would share some of my ideas here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sites and technologies are getting more sophisticated&lt;/strong&gt;.  We have come a long way from the old world of static publishing.  Now we are building interactive content applications that can be constantly tuned to optimize visitor experience and maximize business value.  The tools have come a long way to support this but that doesn't mean that everything comes out of the box.  Every new feature and option requires design,  configuration/customization, testing, and management.  The market is buying potential and the vendors are selling it &amp;mdash; but realizing that potential isn't free.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Document management is no longer bringing down the average.&lt;/strong&gt;  Back when I heard the 4-5x estimate, it seemed that was across web content management, document management, and digital asset management.  Back then many document management projects had minimal implementation effort.  There was basic functionality that came out of the box that didn't need to be (or couldn't be) configured.  You just had to configure what metadata was captured, roles and permissions, and, for that nice touch of customization, add the client logo.  That was OK because it didn't really matter if Company A's document management system looked nearly identical to Company B's. Not only am I seeing more web content management these days, but document management is getting more web-like.  Leading the charge is SharePoint, which you use to create an interactive web site out of your documents (plus a whole lot more).  Understandably, SharePoint implementations are very expensive.  I am seeing the same thing with digital asset management systems that allow you to create an eCommerce-like site to browse through and collect assets.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The technologies are getting cheaper.&lt;/strong&gt;  Content technologies are coming down in price &amp;mdash; not just because of the pricing pressure from open source.  The market is maturing and that leads to commoditization and competition.  The super high-end products which commanded ridiculously high license fees are quickly becoming irrelevant and being acquired by infrastructure companies for maintenance annuities rather than sales potential. When buyers are using cheaper technologies to build more sophisticated websites, the implementation/license multiplier is going to go up.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The net of all of this is that buyers are seeing the potential of content and are investing in building solutions that can realize that potential.  The underlying software products are only part of those solutions, which also require strategy, execution, and continual attention to be successful.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Do you need a blogging platform? Do you only need a blogging platform?</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I was reading this post on the &lt;a href="http://broadcasting-brain.com/2008/08/14/define-blog/"&gt;definition of a blog&lt;/a&gt; and it got me thinking of a conversation that I have with many of my clients.  Often companies that are interested in replacing their content management systems have resorted to an intermediate solution of side-stepping their difficult to use, rigid web content management system by using a blogging platform to power a section of their site.  They are attracted to the immediacy and ease of use of the blogging platform and conclude that they love blogging.  But what do they really love?  And could they achieve the same results on their WCM platform?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you really break it down, a blog could be seen as a website design that can be implemented by most WCM platforms: short-form articles with immediate publishing (no workflow) organized chronologically on the site with an alternative XML (RSS) view and some interactive features like commenting.  There is also trackback and pings but most companies don't even know what those things are.  What WCM platform can't do that?  Probably yours.  And the reason is not the technology.  It is just that you have designed your implementation around processes that you hate: complicated workflows, overly elaborate content models, lots of metadata, periodic publishing, etc.  You may have gone too far down the path with your current WCM platform to introduce the simplicity that you love about the blogs.  If you are replacing your core WCM platform, you may consider including a blog-post-like article in your implementation design.  You may call it a blog.  You may not.  It doesn't really matter.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What if you like this blog-like behavior so much that you realize that you can get by without all the features of your classic WCM platform (navigation management, page composition, template selection, multi-step workflows, versioning, etc.)?  In that case, a blogging platform may be all you need.  Many of the blogging platforms on the market are building in foundational WCM capabilities and are becoming lightweight web content management systems themselves.  While not as feature rich as the incumbent WCM platforms, they are typically easy to use and are certainly cheap enough.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, if you find yourself in the position of happily blogging but want to replace your onerous WCM platform, you should consider the following options:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Use a blogging tool to power your whole website&lt;/em&gt;.  This sounds crazy and may well be but just the act of considering the idea will force you through the exercise of discussing your requirements.  It is easier to understand the importance of a requirement if you think through removing it.  The discussion can also lead to creative new ideas. I liken this to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_de_Bono"&gt;Edward de Bono's&lt;/a&gt; creativity exercise where you put forth a crazy idea and you discuss why it would be good and why it wouldn't work and then try to harvest the good aspects of the crazy idea. If you are familiar with this exercise you know that the proposition of "the plane lands upside down" led to the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concorde#Droop_nose"&gt;tilting nose of the Concorde&lt;/a&gt; that allowed pilots to see the runway better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Design your new WCM platform and website to be more blog-like&lt;/em&gt;.  Base your simplicity and usability bars on a blog and only introduce complexity where you absolutely need it.  Do not destroy the freedom, spontaneity  and casualness that made blogging so fun.  You may find that you could get away with a less expensive CMS than you thought you needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fix your old WCM platform&lt;/em&gt;.  Use what blogging taught you about content production and use it to refactor your existing CMS implementation.  Simplify your content structure.  Streamline your workflows.  Hide features that clutter the UI.  You might find that the WCM platform you have doesn't have to be as bad as you made it.  You could even continue to use the blogging platform contribution interface and feed content into your main CMS.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Web Content 2007</title>
    <content type='html'>On Monday I presented at the &lt;a href="http://www.webcontent2007.com/"&gt;Web Content 2007&lt;/a&gt; conference in Chicago.  Congratulations to the guys (and gals)  from &lt;a href="http://www.duoconsulting.com/"&gt;DUO Consulting&lt;/a&gt; for putting on a great conference. From talking to folks it looks like this is going to turn into an annual event so mark your calendars for Web Content 2008!  I was only there for the day but the sessions that I attended were really good.  &lt;a href="http://www.cmswire.com/"&gt;CMS Wire&lt;/a&gt; had two bloggers (Marisa Peacock and Aaron Bailey) covering the event so you can read their posts there. In the one day I saw &lt;a href="http://www.rockley.com/"&gt;Ann Rockley's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.cmswire.com/cms/web-content/web-content-2007-driving-customer-relationships-through-web-content-001386.php#more"&gt;keynote&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.webcontent2007.com/speakers.html#bshea"&gt;Bryant Shea's&lt;/a&gt; talk on &lt;a href="http://www.cmswire.com/cms/web-content/web-content-2007-when-users-generate-content-001387.php"&gt;user generated content&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://thenextwave.biz/main.html"&gt;David Esrati's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.webcontent2007.com/programsDetails.html#blogs"&gt;BlogZilla&lt;/a&gt; presentation, &lt;a href="http://www.ikiw.org/"&gt;Stewart Mader's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.cmswire.com/cms/events/web-content-2007-wikis-make-collaboration-easy-001390.php"&gt;talk on wikis&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.webcontent2007.com/speakers.html#seikeri"&gt;StÃ¥le Eikeri's&lt;/a&gt; discussion of Web 2.0.  As an aside, I saw Stewart 2 days later at the &lt;a href="http://enterprise2conf.com/"&gt;Enterprise 2.0&lt;/a&gt; conference in Boston.  I guess I am not the only one with a crazy travel schedule. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During lunch, &lt;a href="http://www.webcontent2007.com/speakers.html#htullman"&gt;Howard Tullman&lt;/a&gt; was able to overcome the crunching of potato chips to keep the audience engaged in a presentation on driving organizational change.  Based on questions from the audience in all of the sessions, it seemed that many of the attendees were trying to figure out a way to get their organizations to adopt these ideas about using content more effectively.  I hope they got the ammunition that they needed to start initiating better content management practices when they returned to their offices on Wednesday.</content>

    <title>Top events and trends in open source for 2006</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I have been meaning to blog about &lt;a href="http://www.gynn.org/"&gt;Dave Gynn's&lt;/a&gt; webinar reviewing events that shaped open source in 2006.  Seeing Dave's &lt;a href="http://www.gynn.org/roller/dgynn/entry/20070104"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; on his blog gave me the nudge I needed.  There are a couple of content management points that Dave makes in this presentation.  Here they are (with my commentary):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mergers and acquisition in the commercial CMS software industry may spill into the open source market segment.&lt;/i&gt;  There are a number of very innovative open source content management software companies whose development trajectory and features may be attractive to commercial software companies which tend to move at a slower pace.  This is especially significant in the context of Web 2.0 trends such as a faster development cycle and collaboration.  A similar strategy is for commercial software companies to apply open source community practices to their customer bases.  Good examples include &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/"&gt;Microsoft's&lt;/a&gt; creation of a developer community around its &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/sharepoint/default.mspx"&gt;SharePoint&lt;/a&gt; product and &lt;a href="http://dev.ektron.com/community.aspx"&gt;Ektron's Developer Community&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;The OpenDocument Format became an ISO standard and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts drove efforts to make migration easier.&lt;/i&gt;  As Stephen Walli likes to &lt;a href="http://stephesblog.blogs.com/my_weblog/2005/09/microsoft_massa.html"&gt;say&lt;/a&gt;, there are de facto standards and de jure standards.  Microsoft Office is certainly the de facto standard and that might be more important.  Still, it is interesting to see what happens with &lt;a href="http://www.openoffice.org/"&gt;Open Office&lt;/a&gt; because Microsoft may not want to help competitors of its content management products create seamless desktop integration.  For example, &lt;a href="http://ez.no/"&gt;eZ publish&lt;/a&gt; allows you to download any structured content type into OO Writer, edit it off line, then upload it back in with the structured preserved. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dave also makes some good general FOSS observations such as the fact that there was no significant legal activity in 2006.  It seems like legal fears are dying down.  My clients seldom mention legal liability.   Also, Java is now open source.  I still don't really know what this will mean for the language.  Dave thinks this will spur innovation.  I guess that would depend on how well &lt;a href="http://www.sun.com/"&gt;Sun&lt;/a&gt; builds and leverages a community.  If they don't, &lt;a href="http://developer.classpath.org/support/escape-26-nov-2005.html"&gt;open source alternatives&lt;/a&gt; to Sun's components may gain anÂ edge.Â Â OrÂ developersÂ willÂ continueÂ toÂ increaseÂ theirÂ interestÂ inÂ Ruby,Â PHP,Â andÂ Python.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dave, it is good to see you back in the blogosphere.  I was wondering what you were doing with all your spare time ;).&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Evaluating a Community</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;If you are considering open source software, the community could be the "x-factor" that determines your success with it.  The community will influence your experience of the software and shape the application's future.  If you are used to commercial software selection, the concept of "community" is probably alien to you.  You may be used to reading analyst reports about market share and corporate financials.  "Community" feels squishy and qualitative by comparison.  Even though the information that can be used to evaluate a community is visible, it takes some work to gather and interpret it.  Here are some strategies that I use.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;General Activity&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;Activity can be measured in email and IRC volume, bug activity, release frequency, and source code commits.  &lt;a href="http://sourceforge.net"&gt;SourceForge&lt;/a&gt; rates project popularity on several statistics.  However,  this rating system is not particularly reliable because many projects just use SourceForge as an inexpensive place to distribute the software.  When a project does not use SourceForge's mailing lists, forums, or bug tracking tools, SourceForge's quantitative metrics are less than useful.  Also, the activity of certain consumer projects, such as the Gaim instant messenger client, eclipses enterprise software projects.  &lt;a href="http://www.ohloh.com/"&gt;Ohloh&lt;/a&gt; gives a nice snapshot of code metrics such as top contributors, the amounts of comments in their code, the overall amount of code.  Ohloh even has a neat little feature of how much it would cost to build the project from scratch.  Unfortunately, not all projects are tracked by Ohloh.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The larger open source projects have regular events such as conferences, user groups, sprints, and even recreational outings.  Social activity on a project shows personal investment within the community.  Stronger relationships between developers usually translates into better communication and more potential for collaboration and negotiation.  This is a good sign but not all good projects have a happening social scene.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For me, the most valuable resource is the bug list.  While in the commercial software world you hope to be blissfully ignorant of bugs, in the open source world the bug tracking system is where people discuss possible improvements on the system as well as defects.  Active bug lists mean that people are using the software and care about it.  An issue that just sits could mean either the project does not have the developer bandwidth to enhance the software or that the leadership disagrees with the feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Vision and Priorities&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;Looking at volumes of bugs and identification/closing rates is informative but it is even more helpful to read some of the issues and ensuing discussion about them.  That will give you an indication of the project direction.  Depending on how you plan to use the software, the direction may be even more important than the current state.  Many projects also publish a project roadmap that shows what features will be added and when.  Enhancement requests that are considered important to the community wind up on the road map.  Enhancements that conflict with the community's vision get rejected.  These decisions indicate the communities priorities better than any other information about the project.  While, as in all software development, priorities get shifted and there may be delays, it is useful to look at the project's track record of checking off items on the roadmap and meeting milestones.  You want to know how reliable these road maps are and understand why features are not on the roadmap.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Leadership&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;The most successful projects have charismatic and energizing leaders.  However, hinging the future of a project on the participation of one person is dangerous.  If the project leader burns out, loses interest, or is hired away from the project, will the project survive?  The true health of a community is best demonstrated by its ability to withstand a change in leadership.  However, many projects have not been tested in this way.  I look for projects with a solid secondary tier of contributors and a track record for promoting and recognizing people that show leadership qualities.  It is from this pool that the next leader will emerge.  Many projects designate managers for every release so contributors can test their mettle in leadership situations.  Some projects create sub-teams with their own organizational structures.   Others have a rotating leadership team.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Execution&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;Reliability and quality are not achieved through dedication and good intentions alone.  In order for a project to produce good code, it has to have good processes that people actually follow.  Usage of the bug list and roadmap show that the project is able to prioritize the work.  Having development standards and adhering to them will ensure that the software will meet the vision.  The better projects will have clearly defined coding standards and rules for submitting code.  For example, many projects require developers to run unit tests and include the results for every code submission.  Project leadership needs to be strict in enforcing these rules without discouraging potential contributors.  Many healthy projects also have a strong social order where violators are "called out" on the mailing lists for their transgressions.  The level of hostility depends on the culture of the project.  Some projects are combative on the surface but there is an underlying layer of respect (a little like some families).  Other projects are just downright caustic and push people away. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Participation&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;The better projects encourage and get participation from a functionally diverse community.  Participation is not limited to submitting code.  Non-technical members can write documentation, test the software, organize events, and answer questions on the mailing lists.  Blogging about the software is also a useful form of participation.  Projects should be inclusive and encouraging of people that want to participate.  From talking with experts that study this stuff, I have learned that turnover within the community is actually a positive thing.  New members bring new ideas and perspectives to the project.  They test the software in ways that existing users did not anticipate.  They also test assumptions.  Newbie (n00b) questions may seem tedious to project veterans but they are vital to the health of the project.  Projects that do not recognize this value and respond with an "RTFM" (Read The F*** Manual) response do so at their own peril.  "RTFM" might be the right answer but there are more polite and helpful ways to say it.  Look for the way the community responds kindly to n00b questions.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Economic Ecosystem&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;Are people making money off this project?   If there is no money to be made, people will gravitate to other interests that pay the mortgage.  Some projects are commercially sponsored, so developers can expect a paycheck.  Some contributors are paid by their employer (that uses the software) to improve the software.  Other ways to make money in open source are consulting, support, training, hosting, and writing books.  Look for people offering these services for the project.  If you can't find any, the community may not be sustainable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Unfortunately there is no single indicator of community health and strength.  I am sure that one day there will be some statistical algorithm that looks at all of these data points (and more) along with project success rates to come up with a single score.  However, this will not tell you how well the community will serve you.  The best way to evaluate a community is to engage in it with these factors in mind.  Build relationships with community participants.  Also listen for the gossip.  Virtually every big event that has happened within an open source project has been preceded with rumblings either on the mailing list or in casual conversations.  Once you join a community, stay as engaged as you can.  This wil&lt;br/&gt;l keep your finger on the pulse and give you more leverage and access when you need something.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type='html'>eZ Systems &lt;a href="http://ez.no/company/news/new_ez_publish_releases_include_php_5_support_and_the_ez_find_search_engine_extension"&gt;recently announced the alpha release of eZ publish version 4&lt;/a&gt;.  If you are pleased with with eZ Publish's functionality, but your in-house PHP programmers are turning up their noses for its lack of PHP5 support, this will be some welcome news. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;eZ's earlier stance was to move ahead with functional improvements before making the platform PHP5 compatible.  However, having addressed some usability concerns with their in context "Web-In" interface, eZ turned their sights towards PHP5 support which several other PHP based WCM platforms (such as &lt;a href="http://drupal.org"&gt;Drupal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.modxcms.com/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://typo3.org"&gt;TYPO3&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.modxcms.com/"&gt;Modx&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.silverstripe.com/"&gt;SilverStripe&lt;/a&gt;) already have.  &lt;a href="http://joomla.org"&gt;Joomla!&lt;/a&gt; does not anticipate PHP5 compatibility until release 2.0 (Joomla! just announced a release candidate of version 1.5 so 2.0 may be a ways off). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Part of the process of adopting PHP5 is the migration of eZ Publish onto their PHP framework &lt;a href="http://ez.no/ezcomponents"&gt;eZ Components&lt;/a&gt;.  This will bring the products closer together technically to allow the same development effort to improve them both. All the eZ Publish installs will help test eZ Components.  Code in eZ Publish that is redundant with code in the eZ Components framework will not be maintained in future releases. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the PHP5 move is big, it won't have much impact on most developers.  Most basic eZ Publish implementation work is done in their templating language that effectively abstracts PHP code out of the presentation layer.  On the plus side, however, early reports indicate that adoption of PHP 5 has improved performance considerabely.  Readers may recall &lt;a href="http://contenthere.blogspot.com/2006/09/ez-publish-38-review.html"&gt;my reporting&lt;/a&gt; that performance was quite slow without optimization.</content>

    <title>Web content retention requirements</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;During a recent web content management system selection project for a client in a highly regulated industry, I ran across a rather advanced content retention requirement that I have not seen before &amp;mdash; at least not in web content management.  This requirement was also new to the vendors that we were working with.  I am curious if anyone has encountered a similar requirement and, if so, how it was satisfied. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The general gist is that the client does not want to retain outdated versions of assets outside of its mandated retention window of ten years. I am familiar with requirements for purging &lt;em&gt;assets&lt;/em&gt; based on particular rules but &lt;em&gt;versions of assets&lt;/em&gt;.  Here is the scenario:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Purge old versions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;A monthly process searches through the content repository and deletes the following:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unpublished or replaced versions of assets that have been not been on the site for ten (10) years.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Entire assets that have been removed from the site greater than ten (10) years ago.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on these rules, the following items are deleted on June 1st 2020:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A version of the terms of service that was superseded by another version on June 1st 2010.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A promotional block (and all versions) that expired on June 1st 2010.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;An article (and all versions) that was archived on June 1st 2010.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Purged assets and versions of assets are not recoverable by any means.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;I first wondered why I had not run into this requirement before.  I rarely see content retention requirements in web content management.  Retention is more of an issue when it comes to email archiving and records management.  Is purging old content necessary for WCM?  Is it reasonable for WCM?  One thing that makes web content different from these other forms of content management is that web content is deliberately &lt;em&gt;published&lt;/em&gt; to an audience whereas other content may contain private communications between individuals. Consequently, a company should have greater confidence in their web content as being official corporate information.  Furthermore, once something is published, it is out there.  Infinite copies are made.  Destroying the original won't make a difference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My second thought was about the feasibility of satisfying this requirement.  It strikes me that in order to meet this requirement, the CMS's API must support the ability to query and manipulate versions of assets.  The CMS should also record the archival date (the date that the version was superseded by a following version) of each version.  Otherwise queries may have to look at the publish date of the following version to determine the archival date of a version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have experience or ideas on this issue, I would love to hear from you in the comments or via email (seth at contenthere.net)&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>J. Boye on CMS license negotiation</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://www.jboye.com/blogpost/what-should-you-look-for-cms-license-contract/"&gt;Janus Boye has a great post on negotiating contracts with vendors.&lt;/a&gt;  I usually try to keep myself out of contract negotiation but occasionally I am asked advice.  I agree with everything Janus says and would only add that if you try (and are able) to take advantage of a vendor, it does not bode well for your future relationship.  Like I have heard &lt;a href="http://www.grahamoakes.co.uk/"&gt;Graham Oakes&lt;/a&gt; say, if you don't try to make the deal a win-win, you will probably wind up being on the losing end of the deal.  Hopefully, if you have gotten to the negotiation stage, you have found that you can work with vendor and can mutually benefit from doing business together.  Work collaboratively to construct a deal that benefits both parties.</content>

    <title>Open source and the other kind of software</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;When talking about open source software, it is often necessary to mention software that is not open source.   Most people use the terms "commercial" or "proprietary" to classify the other kind of software.  But neither of these words are right because open source software can be both commercial and proprietary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commercial means &lt;em&gt;relating to commerce&lt;/em&gt;.  Many open source software applications are built by software companies for the distinct purpose of engaging in commerce.  We even talk of "commercial" as a classification of open source software: "commercial open source software."  Open source applications can also be proprietary.  Proprietary just means &lt;em&gt;it is owned by someone&lt;/em&gt;.  It is up to the owner to decide how much he wants to share his property.  Putting an open source license on a software application doesn't make it a public good. An open source license is like any other license in that it states terms of use.  You need to own the software in order to put a license on it and enforce it.  The owner of an open source licensed application can also change the license to another license that either does or doesn't &lt;a href="http://www.opensource.org/osd.html"&gt;qualify as open source&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the inadequacy of "commercial" and "proprietary," I find myself using the terms "closed source" or non-FOSS (FOSS is an abbreviation for Free/Open Source Software).  Non-FOSS is probably more accurate because many software companies practice a "shared source" model where they make the source code available to their customers.  This doesn't meet the open source definition but it does invalidate the description of being "closed."  If we want to be be totally technical about it, we could call software that isn't open source "OSDNS" (Open Source Definition Noncompliant Software) but that doesn't exactly roll off the tongue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As academic as this little naming exercise appears, I think that it does reveal the nuances of software licenses more than "good open source, bad proprietary."  Open source is just a classification of software licenses &amp;mdash; a classification that is not always useful when it comes to assessing the suitability of the software.  Open source licenses don't make software better, altruistic, communal, collaborative, or anything else.  The ecosystem that supports the software defines what it is.  The license is just one aspect of how the ecosystem operates.  Interestingly, there is a meme within the &lt;a href="http://plone.org"&gt;Plone&lt;/a&gt; community to move away from the "open source" branding to something like "&lt;a href="http://bubblenet.be/blog/community-shared-development"&gt;community shared development,"&lt;/a&gt; which intends to focus on how the software is developed and managed (rather than its licensing) and differentiate from commercial open source.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Content Management Events Calendar</title>
    <content type='html'>There seems to a be a real need for a good calendar of content management events.  To help fill the void, I started adding events to &lt;a href="http://upcoming.org"&gt;Upcoming.org&lt;/a&gt; and tagging them with "cm+conference."  I chose Upcoming because they are owned by &lt;a href="http://www.yahoo.com"&gt;Yahoo!&lt;/a&gt; (so I am pretty sure they will hang around) and they use &lt;a href="http://microformats.org/"&gt;microformats&lt;/a&gt;.  You can see them &lt;a href="http://upcoming.org/tag/cmconference/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also &lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/UpcomingorgUpcomingPublicEventsTaggedWithcmconference"&gt;burned the feed&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="http://www.feedburner.com"&gt;FeedBurner&lt;/a&gt;.  This allows you to do cool things like the little Ajax block on my &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/resources"&gt;resources page&lt;/a&gt; (see "Upcoming Content Management Events").  If you want to add the same section to your site, all you need to do is copy the following code onto a page.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;script src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/UpcomingorgUpcomingPublicEventsTaggedWithcmconference?format=sigpro" type="text/javascript" &amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;noscript&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt; Subscribe to RSS headline updates from: &amp;lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/UpcomingorgUpcomingPublicEventsTaggedWithcmconference"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Powered by FeedBurner&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/noscript&gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you have a conference that you want to promote, add it to Upcoming.org and tag it with cm+conference.  It will show up on my site and any other site that wants to display these CM Events.</content>

    <title>Diving into the talent pools</title>
    <content type='html'>Even in this down economy, finding technical talent can be extremely difficult. &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2007/03/the-end-of-the-technical-resume.html"&gt;Résumés are worthless&lt;/a&gt;. It comes down to this: &lt;a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001288.html"&gt;programming is a craft&lt;/a&gt; but we don't get to see the craftsmanship and creative process when we hire programmers. At least not before we narrow down the application pool of thousands to a short list of real candidates. After that, during the interview process we can do things like logic questions and programming exercises to see how the programmers solve problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The issue of finding talent is a very real concern not just for start-ups but also for established organizations that are selecting technology (like a CMS) that they must staff up to support. The natural tendency is to go by the numbers. Choose a technology with a "household name" like Java, .Net, or PHP where programmers are a dime a dozen. You are bound to find a needle in a haystack that big. Where this logic breaks down is that when a technology is so widely known and used, everyone seems to have it on their résumé. You can't tell if the candidate just spewed out a few hundred lines of crappy code or if they have immersed themselves in the technology to the point where they understand the core principles and philosophy. You can't tell if they are a talented craftsman and are able to learn new things. By selecting a household name (commodity) technology you have just made the haystack bigger without necessarily adding more needles. It is hard to find a &lt;a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000024.html"&gt;Jamie Oliver by putting out a search for people who can make a hamburger&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When it comes right down to it, a language is just syntax that lets you do things like assign variables, create conditionals (if statements), and loop through lists. Learning what is available in libraries is the true learning curve when it comes to a technology and those libraries are constantly changing. So a good programmer is always learning. One of my favorite books about programming (&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/020161622X?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=contenthere-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=020161622X"&gt;The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" alt="" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=contenthere-20&amp;amp;l=as2&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=020161622X" width="1" height="1" border="0" /&gt;) recommends learning a new language every year to expose yourself to different approaches. The best programmers love the challenge of learning a new language or framework. They read books on different technologies and practices. If I was hiring a PHP developer, I may get an even better result if I found a great Java developer who is open to working in PHP. Of course, then I would have to find a great Java developer. If I was looking for a great Java developer, I could see myself looking for people who have worked in Python, Ruby, Groovy, or even &lt;a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/"&gt;Scala&lt;/a&gt;. That would show that they are committed to learning new things rather than churning out code the same old way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you look at it this way, the relative size of the "talent pool" should not drive you to a technology choice. You want to choose a technology that has proven itself to be more than a fad so that it will continue to evolve and mature. You want to work with a language that has good resources for learning (like articles, books, IRC, and mailing lists). But you don't want a technology just because a majority of technologists &lt;em&gt;claim&lt;/em&gt; to know it. Most importantly, you want a good programmer. If a technology is sound and effective, a good programmer will be able to learn it and be productive with it.</content>

    <title>Drupal Documentation Experiment</title>
    <content type='html'>The &lt;a href="http://drupal.org"&gt;Drupal Project&lt;/a&gt; has reorganized its documentation into a new set of documentation handbooks.  Drupal's documentation is already pretty good thanks to a robust community using and contributing to the software.  The documentation team is now using a &lt;a href="www.zoomerang.com"&gt;Zoomerang&lt;/a&gt; survey (&lt;a href="http://www.zoomerang.com/reports/public_report.zgi?ID=L22BAXDMCNN6"&gt;results&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href="http://websort.net"&gt;Web Sort&lt;/a&gt;, a web based card sorting tool, to leverage this community to make the documentation more usable.</content>

    <title>Thanks for not clicking on the ads</title>
    <content type='html'>I have been considering taking the Ad Sense off of my blog because no one seems to click on them.  I used to find this frustrating but after reading &lt;a href="http://www.openparenthesis.org/2007/12/10/who-clicks-on-ad"&gt;John Eckman's post "Who clicks on ads?"&lt;/a&gt; I feel proud to be serving a sophisticated audience.  To quote John:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is the reality that the relatively disenfranchised online (to sum up the four bullets danah points to above) are less discriminating with their attention, and give their attention away more cheaply? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Does this mean that the clicks of the great unwashed online (pardon the image) pay for the web using experience of the urban elite adblock using digerati?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Interesting...

    <title>SiteChecker Plugin for ServerDensity</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago I wrote a post describing &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2013/01/monitoring-your-hot-standby.html"&gt;how to make sure that your fail-over sites are running properly&lt;/a&gt;.  At the time, I was sending the results via email.  Since then, I improved the process by turning the logic into a ServerDensity plugin (I mentioned that we use ServerDensity here: &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2012/12/marketing-i-t-in-the-cloud.html"&gt;Marketing I.T. in the Cloud&lt;/a&gt;).  It was pretty easy to do.  The only thing even remotely clever that I did was cache the results in a file so that I didn't have to check the sites every 5 minutes (which is the ServerDensity agent run frequency).  &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/4709892"&gt;Here is the code&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;script src="https://gist.github.com/sggottlieb/4709892.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</content>

    <content type='html'>Thanks for the comment, Gunar.  My experience is that content migration tends to be more complicated in document management systems because DMSs do not always have a way to export metadata.  WCM migrations tend to be easier because the content is structured and the presentation tier can be used to produce XML representations of the content for import into another system.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the WCMS world, the big migration cost is in developing presentation templates.  Most WCMS have a built in presentation tier with its own tag library or syntax.  When migrating, developers need to re-build the presentation on the new platform from the ground up.  This, in itself is a lot of work.  Even worse is when the business takes the opportunity to lob in a bunch of &amp;quot;while your in there&amp;quot; template changes.  Before you know it, you have stumbled into an un-managed web redesign project that you didn&amp;#39;t sign up for.  Without some serious product management discipline, things begin to unravel very quickly after that.</content>

    <title>What problem are we solving?</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before building any functionality, a product team should first start by fully understanding the problem they are being asked to solve. This may sound obvious but I can&amp;#8217;t tell you how many times I see one-liner Jira tickets that ask for something without explaining why. But the &amp;#8220;why&amp;#8221; is the most important part for a number of reasons.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The team has to agree that the problem exists and is worth solving. The impact and urgency is a primary factor in prioritization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being grounded in the &amp;#8220;why&amp;#8221; informs creativity to answer the &amp;#8220;what&amp;#8221; and the &amp;#8220;how.&amp;#8221; &lt;a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/design-thinking-getting-started-with-empathy"&gt;Design begins with empathy&lt;/a&gt; and you can&amp;#8217;t have empathy if you don&amp;#8217;t know what your users are struggling with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Solutions should be evaluated on how well they address the problem. This evaluation should drive design, QA, and post-release review.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help people focus on the problem, I use a simple tool that I call a &amp;#8220;problem definition.&amp;#8221; This is a document (preferably a wiki page) that describes the problem and why it is important: inefficiency, risk, etc. There is also a section for proposed solutions where the author can suggest their ideas. The problem definition then becomes a focal point for clarification and learning. Stakeholders can ask questions to explore the use case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this type of document was the original intent behind the &amp;#8220;User Story&amp;#8221; used in various agile methodologies. But over time, the User Story has been corrupted into a formulaic and useless &amp;#8220;As a _____, I want to ________ so I can ________&amp;#8221;; I have yet to read a User Story that really got to the heart of the problem and why it was worth solving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Problem definitions are precursors to project artifacts like specifications and work items. They should be easy for anyone to write in their own language. No commitment is made to implement a solution. Sometimes problems can be solved with training or better documentation. Even if no action is taken, expressing and hearing these issues is important in bridging the gap between the product team and its users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone on the team should be able to answer the question &amp;#8220;why are we doing this?&amp;#8221; If they can&amp;#8217;t, they can&amp;#8217;t be expected to be contribute to an effective solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Paul Graham on Post Medium Publishing</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Paul Graham, has an &lt;a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/publishing.html"&gt;interesting essay on Post Medium Publishing&lt;/a&gt;.  The general gist of is that publishers have never really been in the "content business."  They have been in the business of selling paper (the embodiment of the content).  Digital publishing, with its ease of replication, devalues paper as the embodiment of content and exposes the weakness of a pure content business.  Publishers can either give content away and look for ad revenues or they can come up with some new embodiment that is both desirable and defensible.  Personally, I think that publishers are in the audience business.  They command an audience that advertisers are willing to reach.  But the audience business has become more difficult with the increased competition from all sorts of information sources.  Many people, like Graham, are looking for that new embodiment or channel that will bring back the exclusive audience attention that was so profitable back in the golden years of publishing.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Graham also invalidates some of the successful content market examples publishers are looking to emulate.  For example, Graham says that iTunes (held as the gold standard for a successful content business) is not really a content store.  Rather, it is a "toll-booth" that charges people to access the most direct path to their listening devices.  Apple controls the path, it gets to charge a fee.  If you don't control the device or the channel, you are back in the unprofitable content business.  It appears that &lt;a href="http://valleywag.gawker.com/5356796/time-inc-joins-e+reader-suicide-stampede-report"&gt;Time, Inc. has a strategy here&lt;/a&gt; but who knows if they will be able to create that market.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Introducing Content Here - The Company</title>
    <content type='html'>I have started a new company.   &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/"&gt;Content Here&lt;/a&gt; is a vendor neutral consulting and analyst firm specializing in content technology selection and architecture.  While I will continue to focus on open source technologies, I have expanded my scope to be able to recommend proprietary software and SaaS where appropriate.  Read &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for a list of services.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The decision to leave &lt;a href="http://www.optaros.com/"&gt;Optaros&lt;/a&gt; was a hard one.   As the seventh employee, I am proud to have helped build a great company and to have been part of such a talented team.   Optaros is doing a tremendous job &lt;a href="http://www.optaros.com/en/approach"&gt;implementing Next Generation Internet applications&lt;/a&gt; for clients, and will continue to grow as a premier systems integration firm and thought leader (check out some great employee blogs:  &lt;a href="http://www.openparenthesis.org/"&gt;John Eckman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.eriksmartt.com/blog/"&gt;Erik Smartt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://blog.wohlrapp.com/"&gt;Sebastian Wohlrapp&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://pooteeweet.org/"&gt;Lukas Kahwe Smith&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://log.hugoschotman.com/"&gt;Hugo Schotman&lt;/a&gt;).  My interests are more focused on strategic technology consulting and analysis. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My goal is to keep doing what I've been doing: writing, publishing, consulting, and helping to make good companies even better with strategic technology decisions.  I will continue to collaborate with companies like &lt;a href="http://www.cmswatch.com/"&gt;CMS Watch&lt;/a&gt; to complement their broad market perspective with my specific areas of expertise.  Plus, I intend to publish a couple of reports on my own.  If you want to learn more, please drop a note to &lt;a href="mailto://seth@contenthere.net"&gt;seth@contenthere.net.&lt;/a&gt;</content>

    <title>Evaluating open source and closed source software</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/collaboration/?p=172"&gt;Gartner has been saying how the current recession favors open source software&lt;/a&gt;.  Many people in the open source software business are experiencing the same thing.  They are finding themselves included in software selections against commercial players that were once considered out of their class (certainly out of their market).  I think this is a great new development.  There are some very good open source platforms that have been ignored for the simple reason of being open source and not having the same recognition as their closed source competitors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That said, using licensing cost as a primary decision factor is a bad idea.  Licensing is still a relatively small portion of the overall cost of a software solution.  When a company looking to save money on licensing also tries to cut costs in other aspects of the solution (implementation, migration, deployment, and training) project risk balloons.  In fact, most of the open source horror stories I have heard can be attributed to this same flawed logic.  An open source software implementation project will probably cost the same to execute (not less, not more) than an equally suitable commercial product.  I predict that 2009 will see many failures from unrealistic technology investments as companies try to unscrupulously cut costs and suspend their disbelief of a free lunch.  But there will be an equal number of successes as companies consider leaner (easier to use) technologies and more agile (and pragmatic approaches) to implement them.  This is where a trusted and experienced implementation partner can be invaluable by setting realistic budgetary expectations and efficiently expending resources.  If you go with an open source solution, be sure not to skimp on the resources that will make the execution of the project a success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary challenge in evaluating open and closed source software at the same time is that they tend to be represented unevenly.  Even commercial open source products (which behave very similarly to traditional commercial software companies) usually cannot afford to field a sales team like a commercially licensed product company can.  Without the upside of an all-profit license sale, the risk simply isn't worth it.  Even traditional commercial software companies balk at spending money on sales when the potential license deal is too small.  Somebody else needs to represent the solution to level the playing field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The open source product advocate could be your own internal I.T. or it could be a systems integrator that presents a complete solution.  Both options come with complications.  If it is your internal I.T. organization, things can get emotional and political.  They will get attached to their solution.  In fact if they don't feel a personal connection to what they are selling (like a commission-dependent external salesperson is), they won't be a good advocate.  If their solution is not selected, there are bound to be hurt feelings and the last thing you want is someone on the team hoping for an "I told you so" moment when their victorious competitor runs into problems.  Another potential issue is that I.T. may not have the resources to support their solution if it is selected.  Presumably they have other responsibilities that won't go away if they "get this deal."  Of course, this is less of a risk with commercial open source software that comes with a support contract that is similar to the other commercial solutions you are considering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary problem with using an external systems integrator is knowing which one to use.  Because every open source project is offered by many consultancies, the systems integrator market is even more chaotic and confusing than the software market; and there are fewer resources available to help you figure it out.  Furthermore these companies are in constant flux as their staffs turn-over.  The secondary issue is that there are big stylistic differences between a consulting sale and a product sale.  A consultant sells by consulting.  He wants to learn about the problem and work with you to solve it.  He is less comfortable just quoting specifications and prices of a pre-defined like a software salesman may.  His quote will be appear high because he is unable to ignore or trivialize the implementation effort like commercial software salespeople tend to do.  And, because consulting carries a lower margin than software licensing, he is probably less willing to invest as much in a customized demo.  The last thing he wants to do is build a big part of the system for you and then have you turn around and have someone else finish it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Still, I do think that using external systems integrators is the way to go.  In fact, I spend a lot of time talking to consultancies to keep track of who is good at what so I can refer my clients to the right integration partner.  The best way to normalize the software vs. consulting stylistic differences when you are considering an open solution is to have all the solutions presented by integration partners.  This will give you a more realistic comparison of the true cost and scope of the solution.  A consultant is less likely to exaggerate "out of the box" capabilities than the software vendor because he will be around when the box is opened.  This will also level the playing field on the investment that each candidate is able to make.  If you take this approach, you will come out of your selection with a trusted partner that knows your business and is personally invested in your success.  With that, how can you go wrong?</content>

    <title>Great Dijkstra quote about Basic</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I just ran across this great quote by Edsger W.Dijkstra:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;It is practically impossible to teach good programming to students that have had a prior exposure to BASIC: as potential programmers they are mentally mutilated beyond hope of regeneration. (&lt;a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/cs655/readings/ewd498.html"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The quote made me think of moving from Subverson to Git but there are lots of other great analogies.  Going from document management to web content management can also be this way.  For example, document management people tend to focus on files and metadata and it is hard for them to grasp that web content can be structured so there is no need to separate the two concepts.  Breaking out of old models and thought habits is difficult, I find the only way to do it is to trust the new way and be willing to let go of your instincts.  It is also helpful to have a zen-master style coach bringing attention to your implicit assumptions and supporting you when you stumble.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Advice for vendors dealing with independent analysts</title>
    <content type='html'>Alan Pelz-Sharpe, from &lt;a href="http://www.cmswatch.com"&gt;CMS Watch&lt;/a&gt;, has written some great advice for Analyst Relations professionals in an article called "&lt;a href="http://www.cmswatch.com/Feature/178-Analyst-Relations"&gt;Advice for vendors dealing with independent analysts&lt;/a&gt;."  The only thing I would add to his list of dos and don'ts is to use the information from the evaluation to make the product better.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the nice things about writing about open source software is that many of the products that I cover do not have analyst relations people.  Instead, I talk to developers, committers, and CTOs.  The big difference is this...  AR people's job is to make the product &lt;strong&gt;look&lt;/strong&gt; good, a developers job is to make the product &lt;strong&gt;be&lt;/strong&gt; good.  Nearly all of the products that I reviewed in &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/products-page/reports/open-source-content-management-in-java"&gt;Open Source Web Content Management in Java&lt;/a&gt; were extremely gracious with the criticism.  Part of it is that they are grateful for the coverage.  But a bigger part of it is that they are used to interacting directly with the community and getting direct feedback. Most open source developers know that software doesn't get better by convincing yourself that it is great.  It gets better through continuous improvement that uses criticism as a catalyst for creative solutions.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn't make sense for software vendors to reject (essentially) free feedback that can be used to make their product better and pay "tier one" analyst firms to try to delude themselves and the market with their own hype.  In the end, the truth (as experienced by the user) always comes out.  In a Web 2.0 world where everyone has a voice, it comes out even faster.&lt;br /&gt;</content>

    <title>Intranet 2.0 Survey</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://intranetblog.blogware.com"&gt;Toby Ward&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://www.prescientdigital.com"&gt;Prescient Digital&lt;/a&gt; team is conducting an &lt;a href="http://www.zoomerang.com/Survey/survey.zgi?p=WEB227RVUZZBRC"&gt;Intranet 2.0 survey&lt;/a&gt; to study the effectiveness of Intranet 2.0 tools and strategies.  Here is the blurb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In response to customer and market demand for a detailed analysis of Intranet 2.0 tools (Web 2.0 tools used on the corporate intranet) used, considered and deployed by global organizations, Prescient Digiatl Media is preparing a comprehensive report on the topic, based in part on the findings of the following study. Targeted primarily to organizations that currently have a corporate intranet and/or portal, and are considering and/or have deployed Intranet 2.0 tools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The following survey takes approximately 10 minutes to complete. Respondents who complete the survey will be eligible to win $400 (a random email address will be drawn from all responses to the survey). All respondents will also receive a full copy of the results at no cost. Please provide your contact information in order to receive the survey results. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only totals and summary statistics will be published. Your personal information and answers will be held confidential, and will not be shared with any outside partner or company.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Please take 10 minutes to take the &lt;a href="http://www.zoomerang.com/Survey/?p=WEB227RVUZZBRC"&gt;Intranet 2.0 Global Survey&lt;/a&gt; and youâ€™ll get a copy of the full results including the good, bad and learned lessons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am looking forward to seeing the results of this study.  From what I have seen personally, employee-oriented communities have failed to sustain the levels of social and collaborative energy that their consumer-oriented inspirations have achieved.  I would love to see what the market as a whole is doing.</content>

    <title>Keeping Django Settings Generic</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warning: Geeky Coding Post&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have worked on a number of Django projects and settings.py is always a problem.  This is the configuration file with information like how to connect to the database and what Django apps to install.  Some of this information is sensitive (like your database password or an API key) and you don't necessarily want it in your source code control system.  Other information is instance-specific like the host that your database is sitting on.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past, I have managed the production settings in the core settings.py file and then imported an override file at the bottom that overwrites certain settings with my local settings.  The code looks something like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;pre&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    try:&lt;br/&gt;        from settings_local import *&lt;br/&gt;    except ImportError:&lt;br/&gt;        pass&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then all you have to do is ignore your settings_local.py from your source code management system and exclude the file when bundling up a deployment package. This works pretty well except when you don't want to store a password in your SCMS or if you have lots of different settings for different environments that you are deploying to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;What you want to do is have those settings living permanently as part of your target environment(s) and just deploy a neutrally configured application.  Last week I stumbled on a good technique for this that I thought I would share.  The strategy comes from an article on &lt;a href="http://drumcoder.co.uk/"&gt;Tim Sawyer's Drumcoder blog&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href="http://drumcoder.co.uk/blog/2010/nov/12/apache-environment-variables-and-mod_wsgi/"&gt;Apache Environment Variables and mod_wsgi&lt;/a&gt;.  The article shows how you can access environment variables from settings.py.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;After following these directions, I was able to do things like:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;pre&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    DATABASES = {&lt;br/&gt;        'default': {&lt;br/&gt;            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2',&lt;br/&gt;            'NAME': 'APP_DBNAME' in os.environ and os.environ['APP_DBNAME'] or 'dbname',&lt;br/&gt;            'USER': 'APP_DBUSER' in os.environ and os.environ['APP_DBUSER'] or 'dbuser',&lt;br/&gt;            'PASSWORD': 'APP_DBPASS' in os.environ and os.environ['APP_DBPASS'] or 'password',&lt;br/&gt;            'HOST': 'APP_DBHOST' in os.environ and os.environ['APP_DBHOST'] or 'localhost'&lt;br/&gt;        }&lt;br/&gt;    }&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am surprised that I limped along so long before using this technique.  An alternative method would be to install a python package on the server (in the python libraries) that just contains these constants.  But this just seemed easier to me.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Commercial open source business</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I was recently catching up on my blog reading and saw Matt Asay's article &lt;a href="http://www.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=9312392&amp;postID=115703318360348183"&gt;Making Sales While Making Friends&lt;/a&gt;.  Through his work at &lt;a href="http://www.novell.com"&gt;Novell&lt;/a&gt; and now at &lt;a href="http://www.alfresco.com"&gt;Alfresco&lt;/a&gt;, Matt has developed deep experience in this business so his thoughts on the topic of how open source software companies work are definitely worth hearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matt's core model is that a community of open source software consumer is composed of "friends" and "customers."  Friends are the people that use your software, customers are the ones that pay you for it.  I think it goes without saying that you hope that your customers are also your friends.  I like this perspective.  Although I didn't see the &lt;a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2006/view/e_sess/9449"&gt;OSCOM presentation that the article is based on&lt;/a&gt; (I am sorry I missed it), Matt's blog post implies that the primary value of friends is that they are potential customers.  While I don't disagree with that point (companies need revenue to pay their employees and grow), I think that friends offer much more than just potential customer conversions. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A strong community of users (regardless of whether they pay) brings new ideas, testers, buzz, market share (so that other software component builders recognize your software as something worth integrating with), and sometimes contributions to the software.  I agree with Matt's point that you need to have modest expectations for external contributions especially when you start out.   You need to get the software to a point where it is close enough for people to take it the last mile before you can get anyone interested in it.  Also, communities are fickle things and building an active, contributing community can be like catching lightening in a bottle (unless you are Microsoft and you can build something like &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com"&gt;MSDN&lt;/a&gt; and constantly pump money into it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So you need to convert some percentage of friends into paying customers.   I guess it is really a question of percentages.  If you can live with a low conversion rate, friends that don't and won't convert start to look a lot less like freeloaders and more of an opportunity to tap other forms of value from.  The conversion rate depends on what kind of software you are providing.  Something like &lt;a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/central/"&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt; is a simple application that everyone needs.  Gazillions of people download Firefox so Mozilla only needs a small percentage people to donate money or improvements to the project.  Many of the people that do not donate code or money, build &lt;a href="http://www.mozilla.com/add-ons/"&gt;Firefox extensions&lt;/a&gt; which bring other forms of value to the Firefox community.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Probably most open source companies are not attempting to be like Mozilla.  Mozilla is a non-profit (yet with a &lt;a href="http://www.mozilla.org/reorganization/"&gt;for profit subsidiary&lt;/a&gt; - figure that). Mozilla's purpose in life is not to make money but to make an alternative browser that is not controlled by Microsoft.  Many companies and individuals benefit from the existence of Firefox and support the project in different ways.  So assuming that you are funded by someone that wants a return on their money (VC or your in-laws) how do you manage your open source company to profitability?  You need to keep your costs low.  Open source creates an economy where potential customers can self select.  You don't need and can't afford an expensive sales force or marketing department.  You don't want to waste your resources selling to friends that are not likely to buy.  But you do want to invest your resources in encouraging behaviors that your non-buying friends are more likely to engage in.  &lt;a href="http://ez.no"&gt;eZ systems&lt;/a&gt; has a points program where partners can get points for various contributions (answering questions on the forum, attending training sessions, submitting sites to the &lt;a href="http://ez.no/customers/references"&gt;references section&lt;/a&gt;, fixing bugs, writing documentation, etc.). Points reduce the cost of services that eZ systems sells: training, support, monitoring, etc.  It seems like a pretty good system but I don't know how it is working in practice.  Perhaps someone from eZ can chime in here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These companies need to make the dollars and cents work.  We learned from the bubble that you can't lose money on every transaction and make it up on volume.  But you can challenge conventional wisdom on what kind of conversion rates you need and the cost of reaching customers.  Anyway, I find this stuff immensely interesting.  If you do too, you should read Matt (&lt;a href="http://asay.blogspot.com/"&gt;http://asay.blogspot.com/&lt;/a&gt;) and Stephe Walli (&lt;a href="http://stephesblog.blogs.com/"&gt;http://stephesblog.blogs.com/&lt;/a&gt;) who has really helped me understand this market - or contributed to my delusion ;)</content>

    <title>How to have success with technical freelancers</title>
    <content type='html'>Over the past year, I have had the opportunity to work with some excellent technical freelancers. These relationships have been both professionally and personally rewarding. However, I also understand that for every one freelancer success story, there are many disasters. In fact, as a consultant, I have made a living out of cleaning up freelancer messes. Here are five tips to help you be more successful with your freelancers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Don't use a freelancer to bring in a skill that you don't' already have in your organization&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you hire a freelancer to do work that your team doesn't understand, you are setting yourself up for trouble. First, you will have no way to evaluate his/her level of skill and the quality of work he/she produces. Second, you will not be able to maintain the code or systems that the freelancer builds when the project is done and she moves onto other projects.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Use a publicly hosted distributed source control system (DVCS)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Host your project on an externally hosted Git or Mercurial repository. This will allow you to try out freelancers with minimal risk. They can fork your repository and take on some development tasks and you can review their work before merging it into your own repository. If a new freelancer doesn't work out, just disable access.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Cast the net wide and filter&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The only way to really get a sense of skill and compatibility is to start working with someone. People who look great on paper and can talk a good game are not always as competent as they appear. It is also easy to dismiss diamonds in the rough. Some of my favorite freelancers were very shy when I started working with them and would have been easy to overlook. With a DVCS and the ability to review work, you can assign development tasks to several developers and see who rises to the top. Just be sure to assign meaningful work and pay freelancers for their time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Connect&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Respect, trust, and communication are all critical to any relationship (personal and professional). Even though your working relationship with them may be shorter, treat freelancers with the same respect that you would give to a full time colleague. If the freelancer comes from another country, you have a great opportunity to learn a little about his/her culture and make a friend in a far away place. From my work with freelancers, I have seen a side of international current events that I would never see on CNN or the BBC. When you have these strong bonds, you get better commitment, better product, and a more enjoyable working environment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Learn comfort zones&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everyone has their strengths and weaknesses. In a new working relationship, it is natural for anyone to underplay their weaknesses. Who starts a job interview by listing all the things that they stink at? The only way to understand someone's strengths and weaknesses is to assign a variety of tasks and see what comes back. Usually, people will start with the work that they feel most comfortable doing. Once you have recognized a few strengths and built a level of mutual trust, you can have more candid conversations about comfort zones. Some people like to focus on work they have the greatest confidence in doing. Others like the challenge of learning new things. The greater understanding you have about personality and comfort zones, the better you will be able to assign work and also evaluate work product. For example, if one particular developer likes to stay inside his comfort zone, you should just assign tasks within that skill area and you can be confident that the work will be done well. If a developer likes to learn new things, you can assign him challenging problems but you better have more rigorous quality controls.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I honestly feel like this is the future way of working. Through strategic and effective use of freelancers, you can make your organization more nimble and responsive. Companies that are not able to use freelancers will be slow to start new initiatives or avoid doing them altogether. On a personal level, you can learn so much by working with a diverse set of freelancers with different experience and styles. It is also nice to build new friendships — it's even more fun than having a pen pal.</content>

    <title>Packt Publishing&amp;#39;s 2009 Road Map</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://www.packtpub.com/"&gt;Packt Publishing&lt;/a&gt; is looking to expand their already extensive library of open source books.  &lt;a href="http://www.packtpub.com/article/packt-invites-authors"&gt;Their recently published road map for 2009&lt;/a&gt; includes eZ Publish Templates, Customizing Zope Sites, Apache Jackrabbit, Apache CXF, Openbravo, OpenEMM, Django e-commerce, Bazaar VCS, and Groovy dsl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you know these technologies and are interested in writing a book, you should email Packt at &lt;a href="mailto:author@packtpub.com/"&gt;authors@packtpub.com&lt;/a&gt;.  From what I hear from the authors that I know, Packt is a good company to work with  and their royalties (roughly 11.25% of the cover price) are generous.  &lt;a href="http://www.packtpub.com/article/packt-donates-over-$100000-to-open-source-projects"&gt;Packt also contributes a significant amount of money to the projects themselves&lt;/a&gt; through their &lt;a href="http://www.packtpub.com/article/packt_open_source_project_royalty_scheme"&gt;royalty scheme&lt;/a&gt; and their annual &lt;a href="http://www.packtpub.com/award"&gt;Open Source CMS Award&lt;/a&gt;.</content>

    <title>How much technology ownership can you outsource?</title>
    <content type='html'>Over the past few years we have witnessed the transfer of website ownership out of the technology organization and into the department that owns the information.  This has been a positive trend.  While technology is certainly necessary to run a website, what makes a website successful is the content and its ability to communicate to an audience.  Even though most I.T. departments recognize this, they have other systems that compete for enhancement resources and they often find themselves blamed for latency on web initiatives.  Furthermore, technology is an easy scapegoat for more embarrassing organizational deficiencies like not having skilled and motivated contributors.  Removing I.T. from the equation puts power and accountability squarely in the hands of the people who own the content (and the conversation) and removes any and all ambiguity about who to blame when the website fails to produced desired results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As attractive as these outcomes are, transferring ownership is not comfortable.  It puts a business manager into a position that he or she has not been in before: an owner of technology.  Growing up through the ranks of leadership, most managers didn't sign up for planning technology projects,  &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2009/03/communicating-across-the-techno-gap.html"&gt;directing technical staff&lt;/a&gt;, or taking shifts on "pager duty."  They purposely avoided a technical career track and neglected to build those skills.  On a good day, they can ignore technology but on a bad day... well, we try not to think about those.  Instinctively, the business manager wants someone who he can shout at (or hover over) until the issue is fixed.  But who is that person and who pays him?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first step is to hire a web development shop (systems integrator) to do the initial implementation.  Even if you are an I.T. organization, I recommend bringing in a systems integrator who has significant experience on the platform you plan to deploy.  These systems are extremely flexible, which means that there are plenty of bad design choices that you can make; you want to work with someone who has ruled out at least a few of them.  But what happens after launch?  An optimistic (naive, really) approach is to believe that, once the system is implemented, business users can just run it themselves.  That doesn't work.  Even if you are lucky enough to have no bugs and contributors that don't make mistakes, a successful web initiative attracts ideas for making it better.  &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2009/08/dimensions-of-success-or-ways-to-fail.html"&gt;Ignoring those ideas is demoralizing to the users and causes them to dislike the solution&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In many cases, the business unit will create a retainer relationship with the systems integrator where the system's integrator plays the role of outsourced I.T.  This typically only works when there is an internal staff member who plays the role of "&lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2009/04/website-product-manager.html"&gt;product manager&lt;/a&gt;" and directs the external development team.  Otherwise, the relationship can get very costly as hundreds of uncoordinated change requests start to degrade the usability and maintainability of the solution.  It is also costly to have this external partner provide the first line of support.  You don't want to pay consultant rates to triage "the Internet is down" and "I can't find the '&lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt;' key."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If it is critical to the business that the website continually adapt to changing requirements and opportunities, it will expensive to maintain a team of consultants working on an endless enhancement queue.  At some point, it will be cost effective to hire internal development resources to implement routine enhancements (like template changes).  I think that more and more companies are falling into this category.  The web is changing so fast.  You need to try new things and continually improve.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here are some staffing levels to consider:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Infrequently changing website: &lt;/strong&gt; one &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2009/04/website-product-manager.html"&gt;website product manager&lt;/a&gt; managing an external developer.  The product manager also does training, contributor mentorship, and first line technical support (including pager duty to differentiate between an unplanned outage and "the AOL is broken.").  The product manager should also maintain and interpret website analytics reports and &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools"&gt;Google Webmaster Tools&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Continually optimized website: &lt;/strong&gt; a website product manager with web developer skills.  In this case, the product manager has the skills to reliably execute routine template edits and basic system administration tasks (configuring accounts and roles on the system, unlocking files, etc.).  It is a good idea for the third party systems integration company to regularly review new code to suggest refactoring for quality, maintainability, and security.  Like with the previous staffing level, the systems integrator is also brought in for larger, more complex enhancement projects.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Steadily changing website: &lt;/strong&gt; a website project manager managing an internal web developer.  The web developer has solid DHTML development skills and is proficient in the template developing syntax of the WCMS.  Like with the previous level, a third party systems integrator does periodic code review and executes larger enhancement projects.  The development queue consists of a medium size (3 days to execute) enhancement, plus a steady stream of tweaks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rapidly changing website: &lt;/strong&gt; when I interviewed publishing companies for my &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/products-page/web-technologies-for-publishers"&gt;Web Technologies for Publishers report series,&lt;/a&gt; I learned that most successful web publishing companies had a development team of between 2-5 developers and deployed new code as frequently as once per week.  If your business is your website, this is the staffing level that you probably need.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Full outsourcing of all technology knowledge and ownership is not realistic.  At the least, you need to have staff that understand the technology enough to know what to do and how to direct people to do it.  How much you go beyond that depends on how aggressively you need to advance your platform.</content>

    <title>Priorities</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Prioritizing is hard when other people's requests fight for your attention.  It is stressful.  You feel attacked; and when you constantly shift your priorities in response to whoever cries the loudest, you get nothing done and you feel defeated.  As hard as it is to prioritize your own time, prioritizing what to improve in a product is even harder.  The decisions you make on a product have such a large impact.  Living under this stress of competing priorities is the life of a product manager. Here are some tricks that I learned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create and publish a model for prioritization.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.evernote.com/l/AAKeIn_FejpGIL6zx5T8Hmfdri1GirRnN7g"&gt;My prioritization framework looks like this&lt;/a&gt;.  Being transparent about how you prioritize serves three functions: it sets expectations; it encourages stakeholders to express their requests in terms that you can easily evaluate; and it forces you to adhere to your own rules.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't elevate the priority of one request.  Push everything else down.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  It is easy to fall into a cycle of urgency inflation where each request tries to one-up the others in priority.  Hysteria builds and you go into reaction mode as you try to keep up.  When I feel like this, I try to visualize calmly but firmly pushing other requests down.  You only have so much capacity.  The highest priority thing should be whatever you are working on right now.  It can't get any higher than that.  Everything else will have to wait.  It feels empowering to actively push requests down to make room for the one request that cannot be deferred. The alternative is passively accepting every request's own self stated importance.  That feels horrible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Group niggling little things into a single item.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  One risk of prioritization is that some of the little things never get done.  Individually, these details never get to the top of the stack.  But in aggregate, they do matter.  User experience is all about the details &amp;mdash; sanding down the snags that get in the way of delight.  To solve this, I like to group some of these requests together to give them a fighting chance against some of the larger initiatives.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strive for continuous improvement rather than immediate perfection.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  Your application is not perfect today and, no matter what you do, it will not be perfect next month.  Rather that succumbing to the pressure of immediate perfection, focus on continuous improvement.  One of my favorite articles about product management is "&lt;a href="http://www.codesimplicity.com/post/suck-less/"&gt;Make it Suck Less&lt;/a&gt;." While this sounds like an overly humble goal, software would be a whole lot better if every application was managed on this principle.  Besides, if you achieved perfection, your job as a product manager would be over.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take a moment to celebrate your achievements.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  After you launch a new feature, resist the temptation to immediately jump to the next thing.  Get closure by reflecting on what you accomplished.  This will help in two ways: it will get you off the treadmill for a moment to enjoy your success; and it will allow you to evaluate what efforts have yielded the greatest impact so that you can be even more effective with your prioritization.  Personally, I find the best time for this reflection is when reviewing release notes before publication and when preparing for a team &lt;a href="http://retrospectivewiki.org/index.php?title=Main_Page"&gt;retrospective&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;These practices work for me in product managing my own time.  Hopefully you will find them useful too.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>First Official Release of Sling</title>
    <content type='html'>The &lt;a href="http://incubator.apache.org/sling/site/index.html"&gt;Apache Sling&lt;/a&gt; team recently &lt;a href="http://www.theserverside.com/news/thread.tss?thread_id=49864"&gt;announced the first official release of Sling&lt;/a&gt;.  Now you can &lt;a href="http://incubator.apache.org/sling/site/downloads.cgi"&gt;download&lt;/a&gt; some nicely packaged Sling bundles to play around with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been experimenting with the Sling/&lt;a href="http://www.day.com/content/site/en/index/solutions/content-centric_infrastructure/content_repository.html"&gt;CRX&lt;/a&gt; bundle that came with Day Software's &lt;a href="http://dev.day.com/microsling/content/blogs/cup.c.html"&gt;JCR Cup 2008&lt;/a&gt; competition (entries due midnight September, 30) and was really impressed by what I saw.     &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sling allows you to write applications on top of the JCR using either server side or client side Javascript.  On the server side, you can create &lt;a href="http://weblogs.goshaky.com/weblogs/lars/entry/esp_javascript_template_language_syntax"&gt;Java Script Templates (ESP files)&lt;/a&gt; that give you access to the full JCR API. Templates are stored in the repository and called using an elegant &lt;a href="http://dev.day.com/microsling/content/blogs/main/slingrequestprocessrevisited.html"&gt;MVC request processing framework&lt;/a&gt;. Templates can be called directly, or can be associated with content types and executed when an asset of that time is requested.  As you might expect from &lt;a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/"&gt;Roy Fielding&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="http://www.day.com"&gt;employer&lt;/a&gt;, it is all very &lt;a href="http://www.infoq.com/rest/"&gt;REST&lt;/a&gt;.  For client-side scripting, you just import a Javascript file called sling.js and you get methods like "Sling.getContent" (which gives you an array of Javascript objects).  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the fact that Sling is still an incubation project, it is fairly mature and robust.  Day's upcoming release of &lt;a href="http://www.day.com/site/en/index/solutions/content_management.html.html"&gt;CommuniquÃ©&lt;/a&gt; (version 5) uses Sling extensively.  I envision Sling being used in a presentation tier where pages are statically rendered (baked) from content in the JCR and Sling is used to power dynamic AJAX overlays using content from replicated JCR workspaces.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the fact that logic is written in an interpreted language like Javascript.  Development and deployment is faster when you take out the compilation step.  Furthermore, Sling is built as &lt;a href="http://www.osgi.org/About/Technology"&gt;OSGi&lt;/a&gt; (using &lt;a href="http://felix.apache.org/site/index.html"&gt;Apache Felix&lt;/a&gt;)  bundles so it is more modular and flexible than a typical monolithic Java web application.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The CRX (or the free &lt;a href="http://jackrabbit.apache.org/"&gt;Apache JackRabbit&lt;/a&gt; implementation of the JCR) and Sling should be considered along side &lt;a href="http://www.alfresco.com/"&gt;Alfresco&lt;/a&gt; with its elegant &lt;a href="http://wiki.alfresco.com/wiki/Web_Scripts"&gt;Web Scripts&lt;/a&gt; (which also uses Javascript as a scripting language).  Alfresco has some nice virtualization features but there may be a higher level of lock-in to the Alfresco API's.    Alfresco has a user-oriented user interface while the CRX only has a JCR browser which is really only intended for administrators.  However, in both cases, you will probably want to develop your own user interfaces because Alfresco's current WCM UI is &lt;a href="http://blog.contenthere.net/2008/04/alfresco-releases-enterprise-edition-22.html"&gt;not optimized for managing web content&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://blog.contenthere.net/2008/03/new-web-user-interface-coming-for.html"&gt;improvements are scheduled for mid 2009&lt;/a&gt; - interestingly, the Alfresco team is calling these enhancements "project &lt;em&gt;Sling&lt;/em&gt;shot).  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content>

    <title>OOXML and Microsoft Office 2007</title>
    <content type='html'>A few weeks ago, &lt;a href="http://blog.contenthere.net/2008/04/iso-adopts-ooxml-format-as.html"&gt;I wrote that I thought ISO adoption of Microsoft's OOXML was a good thing&lt;/a&gt; because a practical standard that everyone followed was more valuable than a noble standard that everyone ignored.  Well, it turns out that OOXML is actually the standard that no one follows.  As &lt;a href="http://stephesblog.blogs.com/my_weblog/2008/04/microsoft-offic.html"&gt;Stephe Walli points out, Microsoft Office 2007 does not support OOXML&lt;/a&gt;.  So what good is a standard that &lt;em&gt;no one&lt;/em&gt; supports?  No good at all.  At least &lt;a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=office"&gt;OpenDocument&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_applications_supporting_OpenDocument#Word_processors"&gt;supported by multiple applications&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But complex layout standards are a tricky business because it is difficult to write a complete and clear specification that covers so much detail.  Just look at the HTML standard and browser compatibility.  Joel Spolsky writes eloquently on that topic &lt;a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2008/03/17.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  And HTML is designed to be much simpler than an office format.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the ultimate goal is to allow people with different software applications to collaborate on layout intensive documents, I don't know if we are ever going to get there.  As an experiment, I took a report written in &lt;a href="http://www.neooffice.org/neojava/en/index.php"&gt;NeoOffice&lt;/a&gt; and opened it and saved it in Apple TextEdit (which claims ODF support).  When I re-opened the document in NeoOffice, much of the formatting was stripped out. I am still waiting for Lotus Symphony's promised Mac release.  That will be a better test of round-trip collaboration.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My true hope is that less collaborative content development is done in documents and more through server based tools such as wikis.  I think the average knowledge worker is moving in that direction.   Tools like &lt;a href="http://www.zoho.com/"&gt;Zoho Office&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://docs.google.com"&gt;Google Docs&lt;/a&gt; are helping here a great deal.  These tools allow the collaborative process to happen in a storage neutral way and then give options as to what format the content is published in (PDF, ODF, OOXML - or whatever MS Office really is).</content>

    <title>James Robertson on Workflow</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;James Robertson has written a thought provoking &lt;a href="http://www.steptwo.com.au/columntwo/archives/002058.html#002058"&gt;article on workflow&lt;/a&gt; and takes a gutsy stance that says that workflow doesn't work.  I would have to agree with his points about the origin of the percieved need for workflow to improve quality control and workflow's failure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My view is that workflow has two (usually conflicting) purposes: to speed things up or to slow things down.  James is talking about the latter case where you put in controls to prevent undesirable content from getting published.  By adding steps to this process you are deliberatly adding more bottlenecks to publishing.  Pretty soon, the sysem is unusable.  The other case (speeding things up) is about division of labor.  Your process becomes an assembly line where people work efficiently because they are specializing.  This only works if people want to specialize and are able to become more efficient by doing one thing (for example, graphics designers and writers).  But most knowledge workers don't think of themselves or like to work in this way.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another accelerating tactic is creating resource pools and workflow can also help with that.  The concept here is that you have variable demand for throughput.  When you need to produce more, you can draw resources from a shared pool and distribute the load more.  Workflows designed to work in this way are role (rather than individual) based so that people share a queue of work.  When you bring in extra people, the queue can be worked down faster.  This is sort of how call centers work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, when designing workflows, think about whether you are trying to speed things up or slow things down.  If you are slowing things down, keep things as simple as possible.  As yourself if a simple approval would do.  If you are trying to speed things up, as yourself an assembly line mentality works in your organization.  &lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Different Storage Models for Content</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Joel Amoussou has a great article explaining the &lt;a href="http://efasoft.blogspot.com/2008/11/content-imperative-unlearning.html"&gt;benefits and implications storing your content in a relational database vs. an XML store&lt;/a&gt;.  After making the case for when to consider XML over the more common &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDBMS"&gt;RDBMS&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping"&gt;ORM&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_Old_Java_Object"&gt;POJO&lt;/a&gt;/Template approach, Joel provides some tips for content modeling and makes some great points about how you need to think a little differently when you work with XML.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would like to reinforce Joel's comment that the XML stack is quite different than technologies that you or your developers may be used to.  The learning curve can be quite steep and many developers just give up before they really get it.  Transitioning to an XML based architecture may not pay off for content management applications where your content types consist of a number of structured fields (like title and author) and one or more unstructured elements (like description and body) that the CMS just reads out what the author typed in - in other words, like this blog.  &lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Complex Systems</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I have been loving the book &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1449377440/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1449377440&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=contenthere-20"&gt;Web Operations: Keeping the Data On Time&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=contenthere-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1449377440" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /&gt;.  It is indispensable reading for anyone responsible for hosting a web application or any important website.  As the editors say, web operations is an emerging field with little in the way of training programs or officially sanctioned best practices.  Nobody is classically trained.  The best web ops people grew up in the field and learned from other greats and being faced with tough challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the book's chapters is a reprint of an academic article called &lt;a href="http://www.ctlab.org/documents/How%20Complex%20Systems%20Fail.pdf"&gt;How Complex Systems Fail&lt;/a&gt; by Richard I. Cook.  Interestingly, this article wasn't written about Web Ops at all.  Richard Cook is an MD and he was writing about hospitals and healthcare. But the similarities with web ops are striking.  It's a quick read and it's free.  The points that were especially salient to me were:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h3&gt;"Complex systems contain changing mixtures of failures latent within them."&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;p&gt;The more fault tolerance you add, the more unnoticeable little failures become.  And even when you notice them, issues can be fleeting and too difficult and/or not important enough to fix.  You just live with them.  Even if you have a very simple set up, the cloud hosting service that you are running it on is incredibly complex &amp;mdash; so complex that it can suffer from living organism diseases like &lt;a href="http://blogs.gartner.com/lydia_leong/2011/04/21/amazon-outage-and-the-auto-immune-vulnerabilities-of-resiliency/"&gt;auto-immune vulnerabilities&lt;/a&gt;.  When adding yet another layer of complexity to make your system more resilient, sometimes you introduce more potential for failure that may reduce the health of the overall system. Our hosting infrastructure has lots of redundancy built into it.  But sometimes I yearn for simpler times when I had one physical server that I just rebooted when things got ugly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h3&gt;"All practitioner actions are gambles."&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;p&gt;There are a few points in the article that deal with post accident analysis.  As frantic as it feels to have a site outage, the author is talking about much higher stake failures (he's a doctor, remember).  But his analysis is right on.  Whenever we do anything, we are making a gamble &amp;mdash; no matter how much we test.  Sometimes the risk of the gamble is much less than the risk or opportunity cost of doing nothing.  But you can't always tell.  It is easy to get down on yourself or your team when a mistake is made or a failure occurs.  But as the article says:  "That practitioner actions are gambles appears clear after accidents; in general, post hoc analysis regards these gambles as poor ones. But the converse: that successful outcomes are also the result of gambles; is not widely appreciated."  In other words, system improvement depends on gambles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h3&gt;"People continuously create safety."&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;p&gt;The point here is that you can't make anything totally idiot-proof.  In the world of web ops, you can script things but you always need experienced people thinking about what they are doing and keeping an eye on things.  &lt;br/&gt;	&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h3&gt;"Failure free operations require experience with failure."&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;p&gt;This point really extends the previous point.  The only way people get experience is by facing failure.  In the early days of my career (amazingly, nearly 20 years ago), I worked in a tiny I.T. department serving a large and rapidly growing company.  Our team was brilliant but inexperienced and we were constantly faced with new problems that we had to solve under pressure (my favorite was our "total network crash" that was actually the folding card table that held all of our servers collapsing).  We all learned so much and everyone on the team went on to a successful career. But we wouldn't have learned anything if everything went smoothly.  As a side note, I experienced more appreciation from the user community during those years than since.  People saw that we were creative, dedicated, humble, and fearless.  We didn't have that dysfunctional I.T. v.s. business dynamic.  We were all in it together. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know that the message I have been sending is that marketing I.T. is complex and messy and you just need to deal with it.  To an extent, this is true.  But it also means that whenever there is an opportunity to simplify something, you need to take it.  I see every piece of unjustified complexity as a risk with unknown cost.  It is easy to relate to the added up-front cost of adding a little flourish that makes an application more interesting.  It takes experience to understand the long term cost of maintaining something that is more complicated than it needs to be.  Even if that clever code is lucky enough not to break when something else changes, it will perpetually need to be circumnavigated by others who barely understand how it works.  Before long, &lt;a href="http://www.tvagile.com/2013/01/29/cruft-and-technical-debt-a-long-view/"&gt;you have a culture of people who are afraid to touch things and cruft is inevitable&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;If there is a way to do something in a more direct way, take that approach.  When thinking of development costs, budget for the cost of maintaining that code. Prioritize refactoring and refinement over adding new features.  &lt;a href="http://www.codesimplicity.com/post/suck-less/"&gt;Make is suck less&lt;/a&gt;.  Most of all, don't let your complexity outgrow your capacity to manage. it.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Boise Cascade uses Alfresco as a digital image repository</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="http://www.informationweek.com/management/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=184429461&amp;subSection=Best+Practices"&gt;InformationWeek&lt;/a&gt; via &lt;a href="http://ecmarchitect.com/archives/2006/04/14/676"&gt;Jeff Potts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.bc.com"&gt;Boise Cascade&lt;/a&gt; recently announced their use of &lt;a href="http://www.alfresco.org"&gt;Alfresco&lt;/a&gt; as a system to manage digitized images of invoices.  The business problem was the need for recognizable images of invoices to support billing disputes.  The system needed to be reliable, scalable enough to handle terabytes of data, and run on hardware that is cheaper than their mainframe's storage options.  Using Alfresco, Boise Cascade was able to solve this targeted problem at a fraction of the cost of using Documentum.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Is your organization&amp;#39;s digital presence &amp;quot;house poor?&amp;quot;</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Occasionally when I do content management assessments I run into what I call the "house poor syndrome."  This is when an organization builds a website it does not have the resources to maintain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is the metaphor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine you have been saving for years to build your dream house.  You lived in a rundown house for longer than you would have liked in order to put together as much money as you can; and you collected quite a sum of cash given your income.  With this pile of savings you bring in the best architect and contractor and the three of you get swept up in a vision of what an ideal house would be like.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The concept grows.  The architect puts in all the latest features he has seen in his architectural magazines.  The contractor says things like, "if you think you might want a heated three car garage, it would be cheaper to put it in when we pour the foundation."  Pretty soon you have something worthy of your wildest dreams &amp;mdash; at least on paper&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then construction starts and unexpected details start ballooning out the expected cost.  Forgotten but really necessary items (like a drainage system) need to be put in. By the time you are done, you are way over budget but you can just swing it.  You can't really go back out now anyway.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On move-in day you have this grand house and you are excited.  Your old furniture looks a little shabby and awkward in the new rooms.  Some "future use" rooms don't have any furniture at all but that's OK because you will get to them in due time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then a few years go by.  You can't afford to heat those rooms let alone furnish them.  The elegant landscaping is overgrown.  You don't have time to weed those beds.  You have made some home repairs yourself and the results are worthy of &lt;a href="http://thereifixedit.failblog.org/"&gt;There I Fixed It&lt;/a&gt;.  You don't have plumbing skills and you can't afford a plumber.  The windows are dirty, every surface is dusty... well, you get the picture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By this time you realize you are in over your head.  The contractor and architect know this too &amp;mdash; they don't bring their prospective customers to your home for site visits any more. There is a reason why only the ridiculously rich live in houses like these.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, lets think about how that experience parallels a website project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;You got wrapped up in a dreaming exercise with designers and engineers that want to build something beautiful (with your money) that is a monument to their talents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You based your vision on the websites of companies with lots of money.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You didn't think about the content that you have (your furniture) and how it might fit.  Paragraphs of "lorem ipsum" were replaced by one sentence on an otherwise empty page.  You still have images with iStockPhoto watermarks in them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You overestimated your available time to create content. After a year, the blog still has only one post;  the "what's new" section hasn't changed in months.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You overestimated your skills to maintain the website &amp;mdash; the outdated flash promotions, the broken HTML, the awkward looking label images with the slightly wrong color and font.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You paid for functionality that you can't afford to use or promote: the empty customer forum.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like with houses, you see organizations "downsize" their websites by migrating to simple tools like Wordpress and keeping things simple.  If your resources are constrained, a neat and tidy small site looks much better than a dilapidated mega-site.  But, like with an underwater house, it does cost money to get out of an outsized website.  More importantly, you have to make peace with your constraints and set your sites to more realistic goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But you can save yourself this expensive excursion beyond your limits by taking a practical view during the requirements and scoping phases and think ahead to how you are going to support that content and functionality.  When you see whiz-bang Flash elements, ask how will you be able to modify them.  When you see esoteric fonts in the style guide and a lot of image labels, ask who is going to produce them and how.  In short, think of yourself living with and maintaining every feature you entertain in your fantasy.  You could save yourself a nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Email and Content Management</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I am not in the habit of identifying laws of nature or industry, but if I was, &lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;Gottlieb's Law&lt;/span&gt; would be "A company's success in content management is inversely proportional to the amount of information that is exchanged over email."  Email probably has an 80% share of the content management market and that is a huge opportunity for growth of real content management processes and technologies and great opportunity for improvement for companies in managing their content.  In fact, the next document management project I do, I want to baseline the number of email attachments before the project starts and not declare success until that number drops dramatically.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you know me personally, you know that I often rail against email as a collaboration tool.  A colleague of mine recently pointed out this &lt;a href="http://cdblog.centraldesktop.com/2006/04/the_good_in_email_or_why_email/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; just to get my dander up.  The desired results were achieved and I was not even soothed by the counter argument &lt;a href="http://cdblog.centraldesktop.com/2006/05/the_bad_in_email_or_why_we_nee/"&gt;blog from the same source&lt;/a&gt;.  I understand why email is such a tempting tool.  That post outlines the reasons nicely:  it is easy, universal, accessible, personalizable, reliable, and people just live in their email clients.  Even I have to admit, the more you manage, the more you live in your email client.  That is why most executives don't even need a computer anymore - just a &lt;a href="http://www.blackberry.com/"&gt;blackberry&lt;/a&gt; to thumb a yes or no wirelessly.  I could throw in a stick-it-to-the-man barb in here about adding value but I won't.  What I will say is that if you compose the most brilliant text in the world into an email, it will have less impact than if you published it in some more persistent medium such as a blog, wiki, or forum.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key issue that I have against email is that it compounds the problem of exploding volumes of unmanaged content by creating unnecessary duplicates.  If you email a document to 2 people, you now have 3 copies to manage and merge and diff.  No one knows which one is the master copy.  No one knows which one is the newest copy regardless if someone stupidly added "new" to the file name.  Plus, everyone is personally responsible for their piece of the archive. That is too much responsibility.  If I accidentally delete the best version (it may or not be the latest version) of a document, there is no way to get it back.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are lots of other issues I have with email.  Many of them stem from a so-called benefit of email that it is a central place and it is in your face.  Most people get too much email and are really bad at managing it.  Because I monitor lots of open source mailing lists, I consider myself in that group.  I constantly miss emails that sift below the scroll.  I know that others have the same problem because whenever one of the mailing lists I subscribe to starts to get lively with good (or bad) dialog, there is always someone who complains about volume.  What kind of collaboration is that?  "Could you all please shut up?  I have personal information management problem." &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Never to be one to rant without a solution, here are some tips to solve the information management problem.  I refuse to believe that the solution lies in building a better email client or integrating into email (other than sending an email notification of some event).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;See email for what it is: it's a messaging system. Use email to notify someone of something.  If your message contains information that you want that group of people to continually refer to, put it somewhere that you all have access to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Publish information over RSS rather than email.  I know that the marketing types still love their email newsletters and I know that some people still love getting them.  It just feels incongruous to me to get these broadcast publications in the same place I want to get my business correspondence.  I don't subscribe to any of them anymore.  I am a &lt;a href="http://www.bloglines.com"&gt;bloglines&lt;/a&gt; junky instead.  I also wish that there were two postal services, one to carry birthday cards and bills, and another to catalogs and credit card offers.  OK.  I know that I am asking for too much here.  You can ignore that one.  But, if anyone is listening, please stop sending me credit card offers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Allow the user to dictate how they are notified of content (email, digest email, RSS), not how they manage or receive content.  Let the user subscribe to be notified when something changes in the repository (See &lt;a href="http://www.cps-project.org"&gt;CPS&lt;/a&gt; for a good model) but don't allow them to get attachments and take assets to manage "off the grid."  Once you do, that document will take on a life of its own outside the system and become a threat to the system's relevance.  The system should allow a user to send a link to someone rather than an attachment.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This begs another question: offline access.  I would suggest looking into a synchronization technology like Microsoft Windows Briefcase.  Even as someone who travels a lot, I have grown to depend on the ubiquity of the network.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If your team crosses organizational or company boundaries and you communicate enough, consider putting up some sort of shared space to work in rather than stay in the lowest common denominator (email).  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experiment with tools that can take some of the burden off of email traffic.  Open source is really nice in this area because you can try different things and see what people feel comfortable using.  If it looks more complicated or difficult than email, people will use email.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don't be afraid of introducing a new tool.  Anything is an improvement over email or nothing.  If you are successful in getting people off of the old standby, you can leverage that success in migrating to a more centralized system.  If you are good, you will understand what lead to success and apply those lessons to the configuration of the new system.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You probably already have tools kicking around your infrastructure.  Use them.  If they don't work, give some serious thought as to why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Think content first, not documents.  If you are publishing something, don't create a document when you don't have to.  Too many people default to opening up a word processor or presentation authoring system the moment they have something to say.  For example, if you have a collaboration space and you want to put up a phone list of the team, don't write it in a Word document.  Create some kind of page instead.  Why would you ask someone to download a document and open up an editor just to get a phone number?  People will just save local copies and work from that.  Then you have to deal with telling everyone that an updated version is available.  If your collaborative workspace does not have pages, you have the wrong tool.   My rule of thumb is that I only create a document when the content has to exist outside of the system.  For example, if I write a statement of work or a white paper, it needs to be in a document. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Think "page" or "post".  A page is something that is maintained, a post is a snapshot in time.  This blog entry is a post.  If tomorrow I change my mind and I decide that I love email, I will write another blog post.  My profile on this blog is a page.  If something about me changes, I will update it.  Use forum and blog tools for posts and wikis and WCM tools for pages.  Of course, many WCM tools have content types for blogs and news releases and that is OK too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make it easy for a person to join and leave the conversation.  Forums are good in this way.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People were right when they called email the killer app.  It is everywhere.  It is extremely useful doing what it is good at: sending messages.  It is also a victim of its own success and it's overuse, in my opinion, is starting to threaten&lt;br/&gt;its usefulness.  I would be very interested in hearing others ideas on this.  Just don't email them to me ;).&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Discount: Open Source Web Content Management in Java Report</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;strong&gt;EDIT&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/77090148/Open-Source-Web-Content-Management-in-Java"&gt;The Open Source Content Management in Java Report is now Free and on Scibd.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recently, a couple of the products that I covered in the Open Source Web Content Management in Java Report have had significant upgrades.  &lt;a href="http://www.hippocms.org"&gt;Hippo CMS&lt;/a&gt; was totally re-written for version 7.0 and &lt;a href="http://www.alfresco.com"&gt;Alfresco CMS&lt;/a&gt; advanced from 2.2 to 3.0.  Other projects have had smaller point releases.  I will soon start work on version 2.0 of the report but until I get it done, I will offer V1.0 at a discounted price of $350.  The individual &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/products-page/reports/open-source-web-content-management-in-hippo"&gt;Hippo 6.0.5 evaluation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/products-page/reports/open-source-content-management-in-alfresco"&gt;Alfresco 2.2 evaluation&lt;/a&gt; have been discounted to $50 each.  &lt;img class="floatRight" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.contenthere.net/blgimages/jwcmcoversmall.png" alt="" /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also, you can now buy a report using the Discover Card - in case that was holding you back.</content>

    <title>New web user interface coming for Alfresco</title>
    <content type='html'>If you have been disappointed with &lt;a href="http://www.alfresco.com"&gt;Alfresco&lt;/a&gt;'s web content management user interface, you should see what is happening in the Community Edition (2.9 - an R&amp;amp;D release).  In particular, there is an extension called &lt;a href="http://wiki.alfresco.com/wiki/Alfresco_Dynamic_Website"&gt;Alfresco Dynamic Website&lt;/a&gt; that seems to provide a much better UI for managing web projects.  I have not started playing with it but it looks promising.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="http://media.contenthere.net.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/blgimages/adw.jpg"/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this extension, Alfresco WCM gets a much needed tree control to browse and organize a website and in-context editing.  BTW, how did Alfresco know to win me over by having an enviro-demo?  I wonder if this work was somehow tied into their &lt;a href="http://www.alfresco.com/media/releases/2008/03/synerge/"&gt;recent Synerge win&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://forums.alfresco.com/viewtopic.php?f=29&amp;t=11238"&gt;According to the forum&lt;/a&gt;, at least some of these concepts will start to be available for Community Edition 2.9 by mid April (although, since 2.2 Enterprise is late, I am not holding my breath).  The feature will be baked into Community Edition 3.0 scheduled for late July.  The 3.0 is aptly named "Project Slingshot" - I think that Alfresco could afford to shoot ahead in WCM usability.</content>

    <title>Product IT vs. Enterprise IT</title>
    <content type='html'>Who owns your website?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the old days, corporate websites and externally facing web applications used to be managed by the only group that knew anything about technology: corporate (or enterprise) IT - along with email, phones, and printers. However, as companies are incorporating websites and web applications as part of their &lt;em&gt;product strategy&lt;/em&gt;, externally facing applications are starting to run into limitations from being managed by enterprise IT. They need more &lt;em&gt;product oriented&lt;/em&gt; ownership. You could argue that if a piece of technology is externally facing (be it a customer extranet that supports customers use of the product, a marketing campaign website that brings brand value, or a service that a product plugs into), the technology is &lt;em&gt;part of the product&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Product and enterprise technology are like &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yin_yang"&gt;yin and yang&lt;/a&gt;. Product technology requires constant innovation like the product it supports. Product technology is in a state of constant motion as it reaches for new opportunities to differentiate from competitors and serve customers better. Enterprise technology, most of the time, is the opposite. Enterprise technology needs to be as fixed as possible so that it can serve as a solid foundation to support various business processes. It is a cost center and money saved goes directly to the bottom line. A good enterprise technology manager looks at requests for change with skepticism. "Why is the change necessary?" "What are the risks if we do it?" "What are the risks if we don't do it?" "What is the ROI?" If enterprise IT didn't think this way, they would be rolling out a new phone system every week and that would be bad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A best practice is having technology groups that report to the business unit that their technology serves - not to the centralized CIO who is responsible for everything from buying desktops and printers to email servers. The companies that are structured this way can be more agile and there is less tension in getting things done. The trend is definitely moving in this direction. By comparison, companies that lump all computer oriented technology together remind me of people who think that, because I work in "something related to computers," I must know why there's is broken.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The big problem with this decentralized technology strategy is that it can be highly inefficient. There &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; be redundancies in software, development, and people if every department has its own IT group. The role of the CTO (or the CIO if there is no CTO) should be balance efficiency and opportunity by setting parameters on the freedoms of technology choices of the different technology groups and establishing mechanisms for deploying and running these systems efficiently. The model may be similar to the manufacturing industries where the product designer has freedom within parameters set by engineering and manufacturing. In software, the business unit would build applications in a sanctioned (and supportable) set of tools. At &lt;a href="http://www.google.com"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, that is C++, Java, Python, and JavaScript. There may be a server platform and database that enterprise IT is good at managing. The business unit's product-oriented IT organization builds the application, tests it, and then hosts it on enterprise-managed infrastructure (or, better yet, a 3rd party data center). The business unit is responsible for fixing and enhancing the application. Enterprise IT keeps the servers running.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In practice, many companies work this way by having business units and departments hire outside systems integrators to be their own product oriented IT. That usually works well except for two problem areas: enterprise IT staff feel like they were circumvented on a project they should own and, when the consultants leave, no one knows how to maintain the application. The latter problem is worse if former is not solved - enterprise IT will be even less likely to step up and fix problems in an application that they resent. I think to be successful in the outsourcing model, the department that owns the product needs to have technical people to maintain and extend the application. Or, at least, work with a systems integrator that they can keep on retainer for maintenance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This has big implications for the business units and departments. They will have more autonomy but they will also have more responsibility. They will need to know how to hire technical people, execute projects, and own technology. This is new ground for many and it will be hard work to get up to speed. But, as business models become more digital, these skills will become harder for business owners to live without.</content>

    <title>Plone Symposium Notes</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I just got back from the Plone Symposium in New Orleans.  At first I thought I was going as a spectator but due to a last minute scheduling conflict, I was asked to do a presentation on the world outside of Plone.  What follows are my notes and thoughts about the conference.  Apologies for the detail and roughness.  These are half notes to myself but I figure they might be interesting/useful to others so here they are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First of all, the venue.  I commend Plone co-founder Alan for supporting the resurrection of New Olreans by holding the Symposium there.  Probably most are interested in knowing what The Big Easy is like post Katrina so I will say a few words.  The symposium was held at the Astor Crowne Plaza, which has not yet returned to its (I am told) usual splendor.  The hotel is still hosting many storm refugees and there is a FEMA registration desk in the lobby.  Housekeeping was hit or miss (either not at all or at 9:45 PM) and every once in a while the carpet seemed a little sticky.  I didn't get much opportunity to venture outside of the French Quarter so I saw very little remaining damage or debris that I was certain was not related to Mardi Gras which happened just a few weeks before.  The primary noticeable difference was the lack of people and energy that I remember from my last visit to New Orleans back in 1991.  Bourbon Street still has loud music and drunken tourists wandering around and making out at the bar Ã‚? just a lot less of it.  I read a copy of the Times Picayune and every article was either directly or indirectly related to Katrina or Katrina recovery.  The overall impression that I got was that the city was tired and still a little bit in a state of shock.  OK, enough with the travel log.  Onto the conference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The attendance was decent for a Plone Symposium, which are generally smaller than the Plone Conferences.  Many of the big names were there and there was a very nice feeling of community and openness.  The program was packed with good content and I frequently found myself torn between two concurrent sessions.  Generally the technical sessions got the majority of the audience. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Best Practices: Plone Development&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By Joel Burton&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are looking for a good Plone trainer, call Joel.  I am told that Joel is doing a week long Plone Boot Camp in Seattle soon and that the cost is amazingly low.  If this 3 hour session was a representative sample, then the Boot Camp should be excellent.  Some of the best tips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make a Product for each distinct grouping of functionality and one Ã‚?site productÃ‚? to hold the skin.  This will make your feature code more portable across projects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use ArchGenXML to generate classes.  It will also generate the scaffolding and directory structure that is required for Plone Products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use VERSION.txt.  It will cause Plone to remind you to reinstall the product if anything changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Read the MySite and RichDocument tutorials.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have a routine that packs your ZODB every week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Configure your text editor to automatically create a .metadata file for your code.  The .metadata file holds settings like cache, security, that you might be setting through the ZMI.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use the form controller framework which is configured throuth the .vpy (for validation rules) and .cpy file (for request processing sequences).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use SpeedPack for perfomance.  This caches lookup of where to find skin assets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When skinning Plone, consider three strategies: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;CSS Only.  Don't touch the zpt code.  Just use CSS.  You can do a surprising amount with just styles.  The next day Alexander Limi walked through he did Plone.net all with styles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Modify the existing Page Templates and CSS.  Do this when you want to make deep modifications to the UI and you have total control over the HTML.  Example: http://usepropane.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Replace the normal view framework entirely.  Rather than have the normal main_template.pt and macros, just use the HTML that you are given and use TAL syntax to reference content.  Use this when you are given complex generated HTML and you don't have time to break it up into the Plone page rendering framework.  This model makes the management view totally different from the Ã‚?retailÃ‚? or public view.  The HTML code may be more difficult to manage (if it starts out messy) but render times might be a little faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leverage documentation generators.  DCWorkflowGraph makes a nice picture of the workflow that you defined.  EpyDoc generates Javadoc style documentation for your Python classes.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use setup scripts rather than through the web configuration.  The code goes in the setup directory of your project.  Put it in a file called CustomSetup.py.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Check out the commercial but cheap Python editor Wing.  In addition to having nice IDE functions, there is a great debugger that will allow you to visually step through your code with breakpoints and watches.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use PTProfiler to debug your template code:  http://debris.demon.nl/ptp&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use Zelenium (http://www.zope.org/Members/tseaver/Zelenium) for functional testing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Make Plone Go Fast&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By Geoff Davis&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Geoff Davis talked about his CacheFu product which aggregates and simplifies all the various caching settings that you need to support a high traffic site.  Plone.org runs CacheFu and Wichert Akkerman, who administers and was in the audience, testified to its effectiveness.  Plone.org serves 100,000 pages per day from a single low powered machine without the help of clustering.  Geoff demonstrated a performance increase from 4 requests per second to up to 300.  One of the keys to the solution is to have as much content served up by Squid (a web proxy that caches images, styles, javascript and page content) and add some intelligence as to how long Squid should hold onto things.  CacheFu overrides the default Plone HTTP headers which are read by Squid to determine what to cache and how long.  CacheFu also sends Squid purge commands when things change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CacheFu thankfully comes with a simplified sample configuration file that replaces the daunting default configuration file that comes with Squid.  In the wild, Squid is used both to relieve the load on a dynamic website (as in this case) and to cache requests from an internal network to reduce the amount of bandwidth needed as in the case of a hotel.  If you are not using Squid for the latter, the configuration file does not have to be so complicated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Geoff also covered some of the subtleties of the HTTP spec and how to optimize browser behavior through the use of HTTP headers.  For example, telling the browser not to re-request an image or to use ETags that allow a quick check to see if the cached version is out of date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Resource Registries do things like merge CSS files and give the merged result unique identifiers which enables you to set an HTTP Header to tell the browser to cache the CSS file forever.  When the CSS is updated, it is given a new name so you don't have to worry about a stale browser cache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other performance strategies introduced include optimizing code with a profiler such as Zope Profiler, Call Profiler, and Page Template Profiler.  If possible, Cache portlets that are slow (such as the calendar portlet) by wrapping the portlet in a macro and caching the string it outputs using RAMCacheManager.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;State of Plone&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By Alan Runyan and Alexander Limi&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the annual State of Plone speech, Alan and Limi talked about their vision for Plone and what is happening in the community.  One of the interesting points made is that they think of Plone as the Ã‚?middle classÃ‚? of the Python community.  The Plone community is large and the majority of users just know enough about Plone and Python to do their job.  That is the&lt;br/&gt;attractive thing about Plone.  It is simple, usable and has a wide range of capabilities.  Zope was described as the Ã‚?J2EE Liberation Front.Ã‚?  Plone won several awards and press mentions over the year.  There are currently 50 translations of Plone and over 300 add-on products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alan has been thinking of defining Plone's place in the world as a tool for content production.  This is somewhat at odds with the view of many who see Plone and it's many add-on modules as a Universe unto itself.  In a later talk, Alan talked about how the future of Plone development should be integration with other technologies rather than building more functionality onto the Plone platform.  In fact, Runyan's company Enfold makes a product called Entransit that allows Plone content to be delivered through other presentation tiers.  Alexander Limi's vision is very usability focused.  From watching his presentations and a couple of one on one conversations, I really get how Limi drives the Plone UI (He almost got me to buy a Mac to BTW).  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next release, 2.5, is going to be a major architectural release.  It will not be as bad a migration path as 2.0 to 2.1 where all the content types were migrated to Archetypes and much of the UI was optimized. 3.0 is going to be a UI release and Limi has lots of ideas for improvement.  One possibility is to move CMFEditions, which provides version control, into the core.  In my opinion, that will open up Plone to much broader usage because lack of versioning has been a barrier for some companies that I have talked to.  The history feature which was removed temporarily due to a bug will be back too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was discussion of the relationship between Plone and Zope 3.  Alan Runyan described how Zope 3 is now being thought of as an R&amp;D project where useful innovations and improvements would be merged into the Zope 2 line or made available through the Five project.  There are solid efforts being made to coordinate the development of Plone and Zope such as Goldegg.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Alternative Templating with Zope&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By  Chris McDonough&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Chris McDonough introduced his new templating system &lt;a href="http://www.plope.com/software/meld3"?&gt;Meld3&lt;/a&gt;.  The design is a large departure from typical templating frameworks where the template pulls in and renders content.  Meld3 Ã‚?pushesÃ‚? content into simple HTML view files using the DOM library ElemenTree.  The advantage is that you do all your programming in straight Python classes.  There is a very clear separation between the code and the format.  This could lead to better division of labor between the programmer and the web designer.  There is even a diff tool that shows you what nodes in the DOM tree have changed.  The downside is that there are more files to keep in sync and there is not yet a production system running Meld3.  Managing HTML forms is also a little more complicated than the traditional Pull model but there are some work-arounds.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Introducing CMF 2.0&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By  Tres Seaver&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tres Seaver talked about what is happening with Content Management Framework now that much of the functionality is folded down into the Zope stack.  Goldegg financed Zope and CMF developers to harmonize where in the stack various services belong and clean-up or re-implement code to leverage Zope 3 technologies.  There was also an interest int mending the gap between Plone/CMF and Zope.  Part of that is to push some of the things that Plone does down the stack to increase the potential for reuse and also get more people involved with the maintenance and testing of this code. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some cool things that you can expect to see are more use of Python eggs which will make installing various configurations of Plone a little like Red Hat RPMs which will walk through, download and install additional dependencies; use of Zope 3 events, use of Zope 3 views which is a MVC implementation; cleaning up Zope Page Templates by moving Python (such as all the tal defines) out (this will have the added benefit of making ZPTs render faster because they will no longer be untrusted code which has a bigger security overhead); and better content export/import to the point where it could be used for data replication services. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Putting a new look on Plone and keeping accessibility &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By  Alexander Limi&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was a talk that you really had to see to appreciate.  Limi walked through how he skins sites.  He did almost the whole things just using styles.  He recommends strategy because the HTML generated by the existing templates is very well optimized for accessibility and search crawlers.  The code and notes were promised but I have not been able to find them yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Compliance Management using Banyan&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By  Munwar Shariff&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Munwar Shariff did a nice demo of a Plone based system called Banyan that is useful for solving problems like managing engineering documentation, configuration management, and strategic planning.  One of the strengths of the application is that it maintains references between documents for things like traceability.  The tool looked very flexible and would be useful for many business processes.  It is being used effectively at Lars Livermore National Laboratory (http://www.llnl.gov/) for managing engineering documents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Integration not Isolation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By  Alan Runyan&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alan Runyan started the talk with the premise that most open source developers prioritize writing new code over integration with existing code.  The problem is especially bad, he says, in the Python world because developing is so efficient and fun.  However, most enterprises care the most about integration and how the various components within their architecture fit together.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alan wants to get make Zope less of an island.  The example that he uses is that CMFBoard (an add on bulletin board that can be added onto a Plone instance) is a dead project but there is no good reason to write another one in its place.  The Zope platform is not optimized for the kind of thing that a bulletin board is designed to do.  Bulletin boards are write-intensive whereas the ZODB is more efficient with reads.  Instead, Alan recommends integrating with an external BB software built in something like PHP.  He did this using Simple Machines Forums (SMF: http://www.simplemachines.org/) for the OXFAM site.  All that they needed to do was make some modes to SMF to enable single sign-on.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alan wants to create a repository in the Plone collective (which is used to store add-on products) for integrations with external systesm.  These integrations could be patches that can be applied to external systems or adapters.  Zope could be a very good platform to support this integration based architecture because of its strong support of XML-RPC.  I really like this idea and I hope the dialog continues.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>CMS Usability</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;While catching up on my Blog reading, I noticed &lt;a href="http://www.cmswatch.com/Trends/507-CMS-without-early-user-testing:-%22disaster%22"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="http://www.cmswatch.com"&gt;CMS Watch&lt;/a&gt; which links to an &lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com"&gt;InfoWorld&lt;/a&gt; case study of a project that was almost ruined by lack of user testing.  I very much agree with Tony Byrne's point that usability is one of the biggest issues in the CMS industry and I am happy that Tony is being so vocal (&lt;a href="http://www.econtentmag.com/Articles/ArticleReader.aspx?ArticleID=7732&amp;Query=usability"&gt;one  article&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.econtentmag.com/Articles/ArticlePrint.aspx?ArticleID=7936"&gt;another article&lt;/a&gt;) about defining the problem and challenging the industry to fix it.  James Robertson, of Step Two Designs, has also added his respected opinion to the discussion with a &lt;a href="http://www.steptwo.com.au/papers/cmb_moreequalssimpler/index.html"&gt;fine article&lt;/a&gt; on the importance of simplicity in large CMS deployments.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A CMS is one of those applications like a word processor where many users, often non-technical users, need to become proficient with no little or no training to get their job done.  Frequently CMS users are under time pressure and, if it is quicker to misuse the tool than to use it properly, the tool will be misused - or, if possible, not used at all.  Content Management is a very broad term but I think this applies to everything from this blogging software that I am using right now, to a Web CMS, to a document management application.  A CMS user wants to publish what needs to be published with as little overhead as possible.  As a matter of personal pride, author's want their content to read well and look good.  But other than that, the less time spent with a CMS, the better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Producing content is also a creative process and content creators don't like to feel like data entry people.  CMS users don't like to waste time tagging their content with metadata.  They frequently rebel when forced to fill in structured forms and give up the artistic license to determine how their content will be displayed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But on the other side, are the consumers of the content.  They are important users too.  They want to be able to find the information they need (which requires good metadata) and get in a format that is accessible to them.  The latter requires separation of content and layout so that content can be re-purposed to different formats.  As Yair Dembinsky eloquently put it in a post on the &lt;a href="http://www.cmprofessionals.org/"&gt;CM Professionals&lt;/a&gt; mailing list:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Our main focus should be the target audience - how they want to consume the content: In some cases - they want a well written article, and in others they want to be able to retrieve small but relevant chunks of information.  Writers and editors must adapt to supply the specific need of their target audience.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, the CMS is stuck in the middle between the content contributors and managers and the content consumers.  Both sides want their jobs to be easier and simpler.  Some of the answer lies in automation adding information (metadata) and structuring a content asset for better reuse.  But that only takes you so far.  We don't want to rely on the system too much to interpret our content and make false assumptions.  Workflow helps too by creating an opportunity to divide responsibility between those who create content and those who organize and classify content.  However, companies typically under-invest in this area and do not dedicate editors to this task&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, the CMS will always be a compromise between the efficiency of creating content and the utility and re-usability of the content.  Content Management is a challenging problem.  So what can we do to make it better?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One initiative that is just starting a new project on &lt;a href="http://www.openusability.org"&gt;Open Usability&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href="http://www.openusability.org/projects/cms-uig/"&gt;CMS User Interface Guidelines&lt;/a&gt;.  I hope that this project gets some traction because I think there is a lot of potential here.  Unfortunately the cards are somewhat stacked against it because usability is such a nebulous thing and people are more likely to complain about usability than to do something about it.  I think success will lie in the ability to set down some common metaphors and idioms that users are familiar with so that they can quickly get their bearings in the application.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like Microsoft Windows or hate it, there are some conventions that make all Windows applications familiar enough so that a new user does not get totally lost.  For example, the File Menu is always on the left, Help is on the right.  Ctrl-C is Copy, Ctrl-V is paste (except when you are using Intuit Quicken where they are "Categorize" and "Void".  Grrr.  How can you people call yourself Intuit!?).  Microsoft also achieved high level of adoption for its Office applications Word and Excel by copying the UI functionality of then market leading applications WordPerfect and Lotus 1-2-3.  Consistency is the key.  An application does not have to be intuitive if all the users are familiar with it.  Remember going to a travel agent not so long ago and watching him or her zip around the SAABRE terminal with two character codes?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another area where things can be improved is the standardization of terminology.  Different CMS products have different names for things.  For example, in response to another CMS list request for different names for sub-components of content, Tony Byrne of CMS Watch listed the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Elements&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Snippets&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Objects&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Placeholders&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pagelets&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Styles&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chunks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Briicks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Parts / Fragments&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nodes / Fields&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Components&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Standardization in naming, design, and behavior will not only help CMS become easier to learn; it will also create a community that crosses organizational boundaries and includes both developers and users that can work together to solve this very difficult problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While standardization will help improve "out-of-the-box" functionality and the underlying framework of the application, in reality, CMS are usually heavily customized to work within the business context (perhaps more than they need to be, but that is another story).  This is where the CMS is not a build vs. buy, it is a build vs build AND buy.  Most CMS projects spend 2 to 3 times the license cost on integration.  To get these customizations right, I would say usability testing is an understatement.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The worst thing you can do is spend a lot of time on gathering abstract requirements and creating abstract designs, then select a product, then do detail design with the users, then implement it, then test it and &lt;i&gt;finally&lt;/i&gt; run it through usability testing.  Any issues found that late in the process will be too expensive to fix - too expensive because you are at the end of the project and you are out of time and money.  When you test this late in the game, you are basically just hoping that the users just rubber stamp what you did.  And if that is the case, why test at all?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What I would recommend is have usability testing &lt;i&gt;drive&lt;/i&gt; the design rather than validate it.  Select a product, install it and show it to the users in its out of the box state.  Ask them what is wrong with it.  Prioritize a bunch of modification requests, implement them, then show the application to the users again.  Repeat this cycle until the benefit of the modification is outweighed by the cost of implementing it.   This approach, which, for lack of a better name, I call "change driven development" (a nod to Peter Coad's "Feature Driven Development"), gives business users a chance to experience the default behavior which may not be that bad - especially if not modifying the feature leaves more budget for improving another feature.  In&lt;br/&gt; addition to helping business users make better choices in design, involving the users at this stage of the project builds their comfort level and ownership of the application and leads to less complaints after it is deployed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Business users know their job.  They know the tools that they use.  But one of the things they have the hardest time with is imagining something new and thinking abstractly.  They are too immersed in the concrete of their day to day to think outside of their box.  They are even worse at understanding the scope implications of their requests.  So the result of waterfall approach to CMS customization is that we force users to think blue sky and, just when they get comfortable, we slam them down with admonitions of scope creep.  Then we ask them to test the application for usability and we ignore their feedback.  This is a recipe for failure and disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Is distributed content management working for you?</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;This is the fourth installment of a series of articles on &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2011/03/what-is-a-content-management-assessment.html"&gt;content management assessment&lt;/a&gt;.  The most recent article ("&lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2011/03/is-your-workflow-working-for-you.html"&gt;Is your workflow working for you?&lt;/a&gt;") showed how to assess the effectiveness of the workflow that you configured in your CMS.  In this installment, we will discuss how realistic your expectations for distributed content contribution are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;A common justification for a new CMS is to "remove the webmaster bottleneck" by enabling content contribution from across the organization.  Baked into this reasoning is the assumption is that the organization is filled with stifled contributors who are banging on the door with content to publish.  But that isn't always the case; in fact, it often isn't.  More common is a situation where the webmaster needs to drag content out of departments who are prioritizing other work higher than contributing to the website.  It is only &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the CMS is deployed that the organization realizes that the webmaster's key value wasn't just coding HTML but was writing content based on whatever raw information he was able to drag out of the business units.  I have written about this phenomenon a few times before in "&lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2010/02/the-myth-of-the-occasional-cms-user.html"&gt;The Myth of the Occasional User&lt;/a&gt;" and "&lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2009/08/dimensions-of-success-or-ways-to-fail.html"&gt;Ways to Fail&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are still building your business case around the "webmaster bottleneck" issue, be sure that you have not confused a bottleneck with an empty bottle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Talk to your webmaster (or web coordinator) to understand how he spends his time. Is it requesting content or is he working down a queue of content requests.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;li&gt;See if there is a backlog of finished content that is waiting for publication.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Look at the quality of content submitted for publication.  Is it just very rough snippets of text or is it nearly identical to the final published content?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Determine whether the content contributors have the skills and tools necessary to produce the content.  Can they create the images and multimedia that appear on the website themselves?  Or is that work done by the webmaster?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Ask how involved the business units are with reviewing and finalizing the content.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Try putting up a wiki or blog to see how contributors respond to frictionless publishing. Remember to keep the experiment going past the time that the novelty wears off.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it looks like the content originators in your organization need a lot of help developing content, distributed authoring will probably not work for you and you should probably take that out of your business case. That doesn't mean you don't need a CMS, better tools will make your webmaster/web coordinator more effective.  Beyond the business case, knowing your organization's aptitude for distributed contribution will help with your technology selection.  If the CMS will only be used by a dedicated web team, you may want to value power and flexibility over simplicity and intuitiveness; power users will have a greater propensity and desire to learn the platform and stretch its capabilities than the occasional user.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you went ahead and deployed a CMS with a business case that relied on solving the webmaster bottleneck, it is probably a good idea to test that assumption before you think about enhancing your solution.  Some good questions to ask are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do content contributors feel empowered or burdened?&lt;/strong&gt; Talk to your distributed content contributors and see how they feel about this added power and responsibility.  Do they feel like content is an unfunded mandate?  Be careful to listen critically.  A content contributor may blame usability when the real issue is the difficulty of producing good content.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does the site owner/coordinator feel like he is steering or pushing the content bus?&lt;/strong&gt; Talk to the web coordinator about the timeliness, quality, and quantity of content coming from the business units.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Has the publishing volume increased since the introduction of the new system?&lt;/strong&gt; Hopefully, you have gathered some metrics about your content publishing volumes before deploying the new system.  Measure the delta. If your goal was to grease the skids of your content publishing process, you want to see a positive change.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Has the quality and timeliness of the content increased or decreased with the new system?&lt;/strong&gt;  With content, more is not always better.  Just as important as the volume is the ability to be responsive to specific content needs.  You want to see reduced lead-times from content-event to publication.  For example, lets say there is some company news such as a new acquisition.  How long did it take to respond to that news with content (press release, feature on home page, change in leadership)?  This is a measurement of your whole content management process, not just the technology platform.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would say that unrealistic "webmaster bottleneck elimination" goals are the leading cause of perceived failure in content management initiatives.  Be careful before you promise this benefit.  If you already made this mistake, don't jump to blame platform usability and focus all your remediation efforts on user interface work.  Instead, invest in the people and processes to create good content.  Shape the tools to serve the people in your organization who are willing and able to shoulder the responsibility of content publishing.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>How easy should installing enterprise software be?</title>
    <content type='html'>There has recently been an interesting conversation on the &lt;a href="http://www.bricolage.cc/"&gt;Bricolage&lt;/a&gt; mailing list in reaction to a review posted &lt;a href="http://www.nautis.com/2007/08/17/cms-review-bricolage/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  I like reading these threads as they progress from indignant rejection of criticism (some major inaccuracies like that the project is dead and also some constructive feedback) to introspection and the acceptance of new ideas and input.  On the point of the project being dead, the mailing list started to think about ways to keep the website more up to date and be more vocal about new developments - not everyone, including some software reviewers it seems, reads the mailing list.  One of the very valid points was how difficult Bricolage is to install.  Having installed it several times on various platforms as well as many other open source CMS, I can confidently say that Bricolage is one of the hardest installs that I know of.  I remember Midgard also being pretty bad but that was a long time ago and they may have improved.  The general consensus within the list was that installing Bricolage is pretty much a nightmare unless you are running Debian.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While reading the thread, I was thinking about how in the not so long ago past, no enterprise software installation was a trivial task.  Installing these systems required a significant amount of time by even experienced engineers.  When I worked in professional services for a CMS vendor, our teams were always deployed after an installation engineer (who did nothing but product installations) took three days to install the product.  And that is &lt;i&gt;after&lt;/i&gt; the customer could demonstrate a fully operational database and J2EE certified application server.  Perhaps we shouldn't abandon this expectation altogether.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There have been many observations about  "consumerization" (BTW, I thought I made that word up &lt;a href="http://www.gartner.com/press_releases/asset_138285_11.html"&gt;but it looks like Gartner beat me to it&lt;/a&gt;) of enterprise software making it simpler and more appealing to casual users.  This is mostly in terms of user interface but I think it also applies to installation and management.  Enterprise software is being held to a new standard by business users who are no longer satisfied with the explanation that the software stinks because it is "enterprise grade."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many of the open source CMS that I track have packaged installers or self contained bundles that you can just download and run.  Open source applications &lt;i&gt;should definitely have this capability&lt;/i&gt;.  Otherwise, the primary advantages of the open source model (cheap distribution and accessibility for experimentation) are lost.  It doesn't take long for a user to give up on an application if he is presented with roadblocks before even experiencing the features of the software.  Many products take this accessibility one step further by setting up hosted installations so that business users can try out the software without even installing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, you should never use these installations in a production environment but they are good for trying out the software and, perhaps, for a development environment.  If you want to run a production system, you need to really understand the application, its vulnerabilities and how it behaves.  &lt;a href="http://blogs.hippo.nl/arje/"&gt;ArjÃ© Cahn&lt;/a&gt;, from &lt;a href="http://www.hippocms.org/"&gt;Hippo CMS&lt;/a&gt; has a &lt;a href="http://blogs.hippo.nl/arje/2007/07/apache_most_actively_abused_fo.html"&gt;very good blog post&lt;/a&gt; reminding us about how important it is to pay attention to software configuration even for software, like Apache, that has a reputation for being secure.  In the JBoss administrators class, you learn that JBoss "out of the tarball" is totally insecure and can be shut down or compromized by anyone with network access to the box.  For tips on securing your JBoss installation, go &lt;a href="http://wiki.jboss.org/wiki/Wiki.jsp?page=SecureJBoss"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  Shipping JBoss this way makes a lot of sense.  With all the security turned on, your average developer is going to constantly run into obstacles and not know whether it is his code or something else.  It is the system administrators job to lock it down... and then break application ;).  &lt;a href="http://typo3.org/"&gt;TYPO3&lt;/a&gt; does a nice job of keeping vulnerability warnings in your face until you change the password from the default and delete the setup files.  Some products like &lt;a href="http://ez.no/"&gt;eZ publish&lt;/a&gt; allow you register your site and have services for monitoring your application.  This could be a good way to provide a vulnerability report service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the message for all enterprise software should be to keep the hurdle to experimentation as low as possible but be very clear about what it takes to establish a robust, secure production environment.</content>

    <title>Selecting a CMS</title>
    <content type='html'>Recently I have been doing a lot of talking (and listening, and reading) about the challenges and strategies of selecting a CMS. On October 25th, Bryant Shea and I hosted Tony Byrne and Erik Hartman in a discussion about CMS selection on the &lt;a href="http://themalcontents.blogspot.com/2006/10/episode-2-how-to-select-cms.html"&gt;latest installment of the Malcontents&lt;/a&gt;. Then, later in the day, we had a &lt;a href="http://www.cmprofessionals.org/organization/communities/massachusetts/meetings.16.en.html"&gt;Massachusetts CM Pros Chapter Meeting&lt;/a&gt; on the same topic. That, along with countless one on one conversations I have had recently, makes two very obvious points: many people are out there trying to acquire a CMS; and many are struggling with this task. I have written on this topic in the past but it has been a while so I thought I would put some ideas down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are a number of reasons why selecting a CMS appears to be particularly challenging:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;The CMS market is large (as in thousands of products) and chaotic with no clear separation between winners and losers. In fact, during the podcast, Tony made the point that there are many CMS vendors that are doing very well rather than a divergence between laggards and leaders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;Especially in Web Content Management, the software is really just a framework. If everything is configurable or customizable, how do you evaluate what you are looking at? A couple of years ago I bought a bike where the frame was custom built for me. As I was test riding different models, I was thinking "what is the point? Everything I like or don't like about this bike (every tube length, diameter, thickness, and angle) will be potentially different in what I will buy." Furthermore, in the case of a CMS, it is not always obvious where the "load bearing walls" are. That is, aspects that cannot be changed without compromising the product or major re-engineering.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;Every potential customer's content management needs are slightly different. Content management is a ridiculously large topic to begin with. Even within a sub-discipline like Web Content Management, different companies will have different problems and different perceptions on how technology can address them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;Likewise, CMS vendors also have their own perspectives on the "content management problem" and how to solve it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;Most CMS products are reaching out to solve problems outside of their sweet spot. Either they are building capabilities to solve problems that they do not fully understand, or they look at the world through such a strong lens that everything looks like the problem they know ("if all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail")&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;Many companies looking for a CMS now are doing so because of one or more failed CM initiatives and, rightly or wrongly, have blamed technology. This raises the stakes in the selection considerably.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;Solving a content management requires a very close partnership between the technology organization and the user community. Most companies don't have the right chemistry between these two groups. Typically, regardless of what is said, I.T. owns the software and the business owns the processes. In content management, it is impossible to separate the two.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;Usability is such a critical factor in CM success. Bad usability causes users to either under-use or misuse the software. Most I.T. organizations practice software development methodologies that are not geared to usability. How many project plans have you seen starting with textual requirements gathering (that give no indication of what the software will be like to use) and ending with a short period of "usability testing" or "user acceptance testing?" The software development team leaves with a spreadsheet and returns with the final product. At this point, it is often too late and too expensive to make changes. Word to the wise: don't do usability testing if you are not prepared to respond to the feedback.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;At any one time, most I.T. organizations are faced with multiple business units that are asking for tools to help solve content management problems. There is a natural tendency to try to buy one solution that answers all of these requests - no matter how diverse the needs are.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you made it this far, you probably feel doomed. How can you be successful if you have this much working against you? Well, here is some advice that will make your life easier:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cancel your Gartner subscription.&lt;/strong&gt; There is no magic quadrant in CMS.  What is important is &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; users and &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; content. The right product for another company, even in your industry, even another business unit in your own company, may not be the right product for you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't focus on the feature lists.&lt;/strong&gt; The software market has regressed into a conversation of checklists. Software vendors try to "check off" features that they think their customers will want or that their competitors have. Customers reading vendor brochures start to believe that they need these features. It's an ugly cycle that leads to bloated software and unhappy users.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do focus on the "How."&lt;/strong&gt; Rather than ask "does your product have this?" (you know the answer will be "yes"), ask "how could I use your product to do this task or achieve this goal?" This starts a dialog that really tests the mutual understanding of the need and the solution.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use Scenarios&lt;/strong&gt;. No matter how you define scenarios, they are a good thing (I can't believe I just wrote that). Seriously, I have heard different experts talking about using scenarios in different ways and they all seem to be good advice. The traditional term of "scenario" in software development is a flow through a use case. That relates to my prior point on "Focus on the How." Walk through usage scenarios of executing a specific task in the context of a particular product. When &lt;a href="http://www.steptwo.com.au/"&gt;James Robertson&lt;/a&gt; says "scenario", this is what he is talking about.   The latest version of the &lt;a href="http://www.cmswatch.com/CMS/Report/"&gt;CMS Report&lt;/a&gt;, and also a &lt;a href="http://www.cmswatch.com/Feature/153-Selecting-CMS-Tools"&gt;CMS Watch feature article,&lt;/a&gt; discusses 12 "universal usage scenarios" ranging from a corporate brochure site to multi-channel publishing. I have taken a similar approach in a &lt;a href="http://contenthere.blogspot.com/2006/01/content-management-problems-and-open.html"&gt;white paper&lt;/a&gt; on evaluating open source WCM systems. This is what I would call a "macro scenario" which describes a case of an organization with a particular need.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prototype, prototype, prototype.&lt;/strong&gt; Don't make a leap of faith based on a canned demo and a bunch of promises. While generic demos might help you narrow your list of candidates to a short list, before putting your money down, build a prototype with &lt;em&gt;your content&lt;/em&gt; and have you &lt;em&gt;your users&lt;/em&gt; bang on it. In some cases, especially when dealing with open source (where there is less potential for collecting licensing fees), you will have to pay for this prototype. However, the investment is worth it. If you feel embarrassed or not worthy to ask for this from a vendor, you are talking to the wrong company.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You are acquiring more than software.&lt;/strong&gt; While the software itself is certainly important, it alone will not solve the problem. The software comes with an ecosystem that can either support you or steer you down the wrong path. You need to be comfortable with the systems integrator that will translate the software into your context, the customer support organization (or community) that will bail you out if you get out of your depth, the product management that sets the vision of the product, and numerous other stakeholders. In my (probably ineffective) bicycle example earlier, I was confident that I would get what I wanted because I agreed with the bicycle builder's philosophy in bike design and the sales person's understanding of&lt;br/&gt;my needs. I am really happy with the results.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understand the user community.&lt;/strong&gt; Ideally, you may be able to build relationships with other like-minded customers who you can learn from. Knowing the customer base may give you an idea of how the product might evolve in the future. Understand who is using the software and what they are using it for. While this is easier to do in open source, you also may be able to do this with commercially licensed software.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All of the advice that I have been giving so far has been qualitative and requires deep and active evaluation. You just can't do that for 2,000 vendors. So how do you get to a short list? There are a number of resources that will be helpful. Join an organization like &lt;a href="http://www.cmprofessionals.org"&gt;CM Professionals&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.aiim.org"&gt;AIIM&lt;/a&gt; to get in touch with other users that have done what you are trying to do. CMS Matrix is good to get filtered lists of options although the accuracy of the reviews is very subjective. The CMS Report is a great resource that presents the product landscape and very sound advice on executing your CM initiative. &lt;a href="http://www.cmsreview.com"&gt;CMS Review&lt;/a&gt; has a lot of information but some of it is dated. Bob Doyle, editor of CMS Review also has a nice and simple article in EContent called &lt;a href="http://www.econtentmag.com/Articles/ArticleReader.aspx?ArticleID=7057&amp;amp;AuthorID=155%22%22"&gt;CMS Select a CMS in 15 Steps&lt;/a&gt;. Like a lot of good advice, it is pretty much common sense. No matter what you do, get yourself out there and start reading and talking to as many people as you can. Don't rely on a software sales team to teach you everything you need to know about content management. Talk to some independent third parties. Use the product in your own business context. Get a feel for what the company is like to deal with after the contract is signed.</content>

    <title>Pages and Objects</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Back in prehistoric times, I was implementing a custom CMS for a very large computer manufacturer.  The data model drew a distinction between "pages" and "objects" and I remember having a difficult time understanding (and then, later, explaining) the difference.  At a high level, objects were &lt;em&gt;items of content&lt;/em&gt; (like a "product") and pages were containers (like a landing page that lists collections objects).  The areas where my simplistic explanation tended to break down were 1) the notion of a detail page that just displayed one object and 2) unmanaged listing pages that just automatically listed objects.  These were the cases where you would have pages on the site that do not map to "pages" in the repository.  If you were to practice the page/object model in its truest form, you would create a page asset to wrap objects for &lt;em&gt;every page on the site&lt;/em&gt;.  This didn't make sense when you had a product catalog with thousands of items (objects) in it.  Over time, the page content type became less and less used until it was defined as strictly as a tool for building landing (also known as category) pages.  That made sense because the site was really about the &lt;em&gt;products&lt;/em&gt; and displaying them in lots of different ways.  But if this had been a project to build a typical brochure site  (where contributors focused on managing things like the "about" page or the "services" page) we may have gone in the other direction and focused on pages.  Objects would have diminished to components that could be re-used across pages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another way to look at is to ask who owns the pages, the contributor or the display tier?  In a page based model the user owns the page.  He places the page in a site hierarchy, gives it a URL, and then fills it with content.  In the object based model, the contributor feeds in the content and the display tier (the controllers and the views) has the logic to decide what content to show and how to show it.  Like I mentioned in my computer manufacturer website story, the object based approach tends to do better with sites that have more content than is practical to manually organize onto pages.  In an extreme example, think about if www.google.com was a website that someone had to manage.  No matter how many editors they hired, it would be impossible for an editorial staff to manage every single result page.  &lt;em&gt;Maybe&lt;/em&gt; they could go in and fix the descriptions of a few index entries here and there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I look at web content management systems today, I see similar stories to my prehistoric custom web content management system experience.  Every web content management system on the market today grew out of some project to build a website and then was abstracted to build more websites.  A WCMS is either conceived as a product and then heavily shaped by its earliest customers or it starts life as an in-house project and then is abstracted into something that could be resold.  Those initial uses leave their imprint and become part of the product's DNA.  That doesn't mean that products are necessarily limited in their use.  As it matures, a product runs into diverse range of potential customers that forces it to broaden its capabilities.  In the real world, of course, web sites are combination of pages and objects and the contributor needs at least some level of control of both.  However, this digital DNA does help determine what problems it solves more naturally (or comfortably, or intuitively) than others.  Page based systems need to figure out a clean way to manage "placeless" content and object based systems need to figure out a simple way to manage basic pages.  Some of these additions feel more awkward than others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only way to really appreciate the difference in approach and its implications for you is by demonstrating the products managing a &lt;em&gt;site like yours with content like yours&lt;/em&gt;.  I like the scenario approach where you (or the vendor) build a prototype using your content types and then testing it with your typical usage scenarios.  It is only then that you will see how well it addresses your balance of objects and pages.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Comparison Between Drupal and Django</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href="http://birdhouse.org/blog/2009/11/11/drupal-or-django/"&gt;article comparing Drupal to Django&lt;/a&gt; is pretty old but I just noticed it.  There is a nice summary in the conclusion:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Drupal represents a middle ground between framework and CMS that we’ve chosen not to take. Drupal is far more capable than a CMS like WordPress, but also much less flexible than a pure framework. But more importantly, the facts that Drupal isn’t object-oriented, isn’t MVC/MTV, doesn’t have an ORM, and is generally less flexible than a pure framework, not to mention our preference for working in Python over PHP, all contribute to our decision not to use it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;I reached a similar conclusion on a recent project.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>When it is not all about the software</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;When I help companies through a &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/category/selection"&gt;CMS selection&lt;/a&gt;, I focus on the whole solution rather than just the functionality of the software.  Factors such as vendor compatibility and expertise availability (internal and external) also affect the sustainability of the solution &amp;mdash sometimes even more than the feature set.  Several of my recent consulting projects have de-emphasized the software component of the solution even more.  These selections were part of larger initiatives that required significant help from an outside partner.  In one case there was a comprehensive site redesign that included digital strategy, re-branding, and information re-architecture as well as implementing new functionality.  In another case, the client was shifting to an outsourced model where a partner was to maintain the full infrastructure and assume all development responsibilities.  In situations like these, while the software is important, the biggest risk is choosing the wrong partner to work with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A dual selection like this poses a real problem.  If you focus on the partner, you have the software choice made for you.  I know that there are systems integrators that claim technology agnosticism but I seriously doubt them.  The truth is that it takes a couple implementations on any platform to get it right.  In some cases, it takes many (like 5) projects to run out of ways to mess things up.  That is the downside of flexibility.  So, when someone says "technology agnostic," I hear either "we don't have skills on any platform" or, like the the waitress at &lt;a href="http://www.bluesbrotherscentral.com/movies/the-blues-brothers/scmods/bobs-country-bunker/"&gt;Bob's Country Bunker&lt;/a&gt; said: "Oh, we got both kinds [of music]. We got Country, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; Western." It could be even worse: &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2007/09/the-importance-of-vendor-neutrality.html"&gt;the integrator who claims neutrality can be paid by the software vendor to recommend a solution&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other option is to go with a pure design agency and select a product (and integrator) afterwards to implement that design.  This can be inefficient because the designers can arbitrarily and unknowingly make decisions that make implementation harder.   You will probably need to rescope and refactor the design based on the native capabilities of the platform you choose.  A lot of time can be saved if you have someone to suggest more efficient options during the design process.  I know I am going to get slammed here by developers and software companies saying their product can do anything.  If they could, they would have 100% market share.  Pure strategy and design companies also tend to underestimate the cost of implementation so you might running out of money when it is time to implement the design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a chicken and egg problem.  You can't choose a product until you have had help with your requirements and you can't get help with your requirements until you choose a development agency (that implicitly comes with a product).  I have found this variation of &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2007/05/how-to-select-a-cms.html"&gt;my standard process&lt;/a&gt; to be effective.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gather the requirements that are the most meaningful to a product selection.  I call these &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2008/11/leading-requirements.html"&gt;leading requirements&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use these functional and non-functional requirements to filter down the software marketplace to a very short list of product options (probably no more than two).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Find a couple of the best web agencies who specialize in working on either of these platforms &amp;mdash; ideally, two for each of the two products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Invite these agencies to present a solution based on their preferred platform.  Like in my normal selection process, the &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2007/09/how-to-make-the-most-out-of-a-vendor-demo.html"&gt;presentation consists of the demonstration of scenarios that you defined when you gathered your leading requirements&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Evaluate the presentations across two dimensions: the product and the agency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have found this process to be extremely effective.  The benefit that I didn't anticipate was that the preparation of the prototype tested three very important aspects of the integrators: their consultative process for turning customer articulated requirements into a solution; their mastery over the platform; and their relationship with the software vendor.  But the process is not perfect.  Here are some issues:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A professional services company has lower margins than a software company.  They don't have the prospect of an all-profit software license deal to justify a big bet on a sales initiative.  Professional services companies will put up with a lot less run around than a software company will &amp;mdash; especially the good ones.  So the process has to be efficient and they need to have a good shot at winning.  This means that you need to: have a short list of no more than four integrators; have budgeting worked out &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; you contact with them; and work together with them to get what you need.  This collaboration is also useful in getting a feel for what it will be like to work with the firm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some integrators have dedicated sales teams that can prevent you from getting to know their consulting capabilities.  You should do everything you can to work directly with real consultants.  Not only is it important to learn about their style and capabilities, delivery staff are less likely to tell you what they think you want to hear.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Those filtering steps (1-3) are very hard if you are just learning about web development and don't know your way around the industry.  You need to talk to lots of people and learn from their experiences or work with someone who has.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite all of these challenges, doing a dual selection is not impossible.  In fact, it can be quite fruitful.  You just need to be focused and disciplined in your approach and execution.  If you are interested in learning more, I am teaching a &lt;a href="http://gilbaneboston.com/workshops.html#workshopa"&gt;workshop on Selecting a CMS at the Gilbane Conference in Boston on December 1st&lt;/a&gt;.  I hope to see you there.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Python Gets Drupy</title>
    <content type='html'>Via &lt;a href="http://bmannconsulting.com"&gt;Boris Mann's blog&lt;/a&gt;, I just learned about &lt;a href="http://drupy.net/"&gt;Drupy&lt;/a&gt; - a full port of &lt;a href="http://drupal.org/"&gt;Drupal&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="http://www.python.org/"&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt;.  Among all the initial reactions I have to this announcement, the one that screams the loudest is "why?"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drupal is an intentionally, non-object oriented framework.  Drupal does not use PHP's implementation of classes and there is no inheritance - at least not in a classic OOP sense .  The architecture works by exposing &lt;em&gt;hooks&lt;/em&gt; by which modules can be called by core system functions and do extra stuff.  To a Python programmer thats just, well, &lt;a href="http://faassen.n--tree.net/blog/view/weblog/2005/08/06/0"&gt;un-pythonic&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Python is a super-object oriented language.  EVERYTHING is an object.  Even a function is an object (pause to wait for non-pythonista heads to stop spinning).  Python also has plenty of frameworks of its own.  &lt;a href="http://zope.org"&gt;Zope&lt;/a&gt; is the grand-daddy of content oriented web application frameworks but it is a lot more complicated to fully understand than Drupal.  &lt;a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/"&gt;Django&lt;/a&gt; fills the role of a leaner, content-friendly Python web application development framework.  Furthermore, one of the really great things about Drupal is that it is written in PHP and it doesn't take too long for a good PHP programmer to understand how it works.  There are far fewer Python developers than PHP developers out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The single reason why this could be a good idea is if you could run Drupal modules on top of Drupy.  However, given that modules often don't work across multiple versions of Drupal, my confidence that they could integrate with Drupy is very low.  I think a better idea would be a CMS that is functionally similar to Drupal written on top of a Python framework (like Django).  In particular, a CMS with strong user profile management, a taxonomy based system for organizing the repository, and extensible through the addition of modules.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, like with a lot of other things, I reserve the right to change my mind when I see more.  But for now, I'll take my Drupal in PHP and go with something else when I want to code in Python.  Drupy team, I welcome you to prove me wrong.</content>

    <title>Content as Cathedral and Bazaar</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I have been thinking about the idea that ECM (one central system for all content) is a myth and I feel like there is a lot of credence to it. As an implementer of CMS, I know how hard content management projects can be if several departments are involved. It is very difficult to get all the stakeholders (creators and consumers of content) at the table and even those who are represented are not happy with the compromises that they have to make. As an architect, designing a universal content model that is both all encompassing and easy to use is very difficult (it is easier in the case of unstructured content such as a document management system where everything is either a document or a folder).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the project is successful, once the system is in place and people start really using it, they start to learn its potential and come up with innovative new applications and extensions. The list of enhancement requests grows and grows but, the more constituencies that use the system, the harder it is to scope future releases. Users start to feel like they are not being heard and lose a sense of ownership over the system. Interest in the system declines as users direct their creativity to circumvent the system with work-arounds (EMAIL!) that undermine the spirit of the initiative of building a high quality centralized content repository.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In lots of way's I am reminded of &lt;a href="http://www.catb.org/%7Eesr/"&gt;Eric Reymond's&lt;/a&gt; famous metaphor &lt;a href="http://www.catb.org/%7Eesr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/"&gt;The Cathedral and the Bazaar&lt;/a&gt;. For those who are not familiar with the metaphor, the cathedral is a centrally managed and architected structure and the bazaar is a decentralized organism that is defined by individual motivations adding up to market forces. The reason why I like this metaphor for content is that, in many cases, content is a creative process where people have an idea or knowledge and want to communicate it. A marketplace is created when creators and consumers of content connect and collaborate. As Reymond put it: "a great babbling bazaar of differing agendas and approaches". A cathedral is controlled by the vision of a central authority. It is formal. Nothing gets in without the architects approval.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like a society, an organization needs both: a bazaar for employees to navigate, collaborate, and innovate; and a cathedral to show the world its achievement and its aspirations. The bazaar is the internal team workspaces, departmental wikis, and blogs. The cathedral is the publishing process and product. To drive this metaphor into the ground, I picture the cathedral's architect working his way through the bazaar to identify the images and artifacts that he will incorporate into the cathedral.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When an ECM vendor tries to shoe-horn a company's bazaar into their cathedral, they threaten to either make the cathedral too chaotic or to stifle the creative energy that drives the company. In a real world example, if I wrote up some instructions for solving a common problem, and I decided that my peers could benefit, in that moment, I want to publish something. If I have to jump through hoops to get it done, I may just forget about it and let it die on my hard drive, or at most, email it around to the people that I know could use the information. However, if I could publish it to a more permanent place, the information has a better chance of surviving.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what can be done to make the bazaar less chaotic and intimidating? I think that the answer lies in enterprise search and other technologies that can deal with navigating a repository that was not primarily meant to be navigated. Search is what keeps the Web useful. The litmus test for a good repository is that it improves, rather than degrades, over time and I think the Web, and search, passes that test. I saw a presentation on some very cool search technologies that make me feel confident that things are going to get even better. Another strategy to sort out all of this confusion is the directory model like &lt;a href="http://www.dmoz.org/"&gt;DMOZ&lt;/a&gt;.  A while ago, I did some work for the Department of Defense, and learned about &lt;a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/"&gt;DefenseLINK&lt;/a&gt; where military sites can register to be indexed and included in a directory. In order to be included in DefenseLINK, you have to meet certain standards (like accessibility) and have someone responsible for the content. I think they also require some metadata although I am not sure how it is used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These strategies shift the burden of organizing the universe of content away from the content creators at creation time to a centralized organization or technology trying to make sense of everything after the fact. I don't underestimate the difficulty of this responsibility but I think it is more realistic than to expect all content communities (small groups of creators and consumers) to adhere to the same set of rules and expend additional effort when it is not related to the immediate task at hand. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have some ideas in this area, please shoot me an &lt;a href="mailto:sgottlieb@optaros.com"&gt;email&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Designing for Drupal</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.chapterthree.com/blog/nica_lorber/design_drupal_template_approach"&gt;Nica Lorbor, from Chapter Three, has a great post on their highly optimized Drupal design process&lt;/a&gt;.  In the article, Nica shows how they start from a &lt;a href="http://drupal.org"&gt;Drupal&lt;/a&gt; template that has roughly 25 common named elements (some native Drupal, some not) that can be styled according client specifications.  A specialized Fireworks template calls out these elements and helps map them to a mockup to facilitate conversation between the designer and the developer.  This creates a common language that binds the design to the code that the developer needs to work on.  This also probably quickly identifies visual design elements that are not part of the normal Drupal/Chapter Three build, which need special consideration for estimation and budgeting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think the efficiency of this process supports my philosophy that you should work with a partner that specializes in the CMS that you intend to implement.  Chapter Three didn't invent this methodology for their first Drupal implementation.  I am sure that it evolved over time.  It also speaks to the efficiency of designing with the platform in mind.  With this process, everybody on the project (from designers to developers) understands what is going to be easy and what is going to be hard.  Designers are guided towards concepts that are more efficient to build.  Yes, you &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; build any design on Drupal, but that doesn't mean that you should. With some site designs,  you will be fighting the natural tendencies of the platform: increasing both the implementation and maintenance costs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I should probably make the point here that I am not implying that all Drupal sites (or sites from any other CMS) look alike - particularly to the untrained eye.  Nearly all of what the casual site visitor notices (font, palette, page layout, buttons, etc.) is totally customizable in Drupal and any other CMS platform.  Guessing what CMS was used involves much more subtle characteristics that you wouldn't notice unless you worked with the platform extensively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This all raises a &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2009/11/when-it-is-not-all-about-the-software.html"&gt;chicken and egg problem that I have discussed before&lt;/a&gt;.  If the product influences the design and the design defines the requirements that drive the product selection, where do you start?  As I mentioned in &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2009/11/when-it-is-not-all-about-the-software.html"&gt;"When it is not all about the software,"&lt;/a&gt; the key is knowing enough about your requirements to define a short list of options that you can evaluate on more subjective levels (such as aspects of design).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Technology Selection Pitfalls</title>
    <content type='html'>Tony Byrne, of &lt;a href="http://www.cmswatch.com"&gt;CMS Watch&lt;/a&gt; fame, just posted an excellent &lt;a href="http://www.cmswatch.com/Feature/128-Selecting-Products"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; on 5 common pitfalls encountered in a technology selection.  People who have been through a number of these selections (from either the customer or vendor side) will recognize many of these issues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://contenthere.blogspot.com/2005/01/selecting-cms-with-narratives.html"&gt;I absolutely agree&lt;/a&gt; with Tony's point about becoming slaves to spreadsheets and the recommendation to consider more &lt;a href="http://www.steptwo.com.au/papers/cmb_narrativetender/index.html"&gt;qualitative methods&lt;/a&gt; to examine the suitability of software (Pitfall #2).  I also agree that the vendor that you work with is every bit as important as the feature/function/price of the product (Pitfall #4).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most powerful technology selection technique you can leverage is talking to other users of the technology.  Try to find other organizations that have similar business needs (not feature needs) and learn about their experiences with the technology and the support organization behind it.  You will learn more this way than you will from hours of product demos and brochure reading.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Open source is not the only kind of software that has user communities.  Commercial software has them too.  Some vendors try to get in the way of customers (and prospects) learning from each other.  Others encourage it.  In fact, for some commercial software, customer forums are the most effective way of getting support.  No matter what your software choice, use the community.  If you can't/don't, you will suffer alone.</content>

    <title>Workflow: is it a factory or is it Congress?</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;There have been a number of interesting posts on workflow recently.  Some &lt;a href="http://jboye.com/blogpost/8-cms-features-customers-want-but-never-use/"&gt;say that workflow is a feature that is often asked for but seldom used&lt;/a&gt;.  Others tell you that &lt;a href="http://dev.day.com/content/ddc/blog/2011/03/why_your_cms_needsa.html"&gt;workflow is the foundation upon which automation is built&lt;/a&gt;.  Both arguments have their points.  For me, workflow is what you make of it.  Depending on your requirements, you workflows may be sophisticated or simplistic.  It just so happens that most organizations do not really know what do with workflow.  Their processes were broken before and, until the processes are improved, workflow will only accelerate the transition from one stagnating work queue to another.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A good way to think about workflow is manufacturing vs. legislation.  In a manufacturing model, you have a lot of content to produce and you have specialists who are really good at doing one aspect of the content production process (copy-editing, creating graphics, fact-checking, etc.).  These specialists are sitting at their workstations waiting for their next task &amp;mdash; that's their job.  In this model, a workflow tool is tremendously helpful.  It's like the conveyor belt in a factory that moves the units from one station to the next.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unless your organization is in the content business, the manufacturing metaphor probably doesn't apply to you.  You can think of your content producers as craftsmen that make unique items all on their own.  When it does it occur, collaboration is typically ad-hoc and informal.  Workflow is not going to help them any more than a factory is going to help a sculptor.  The one exception there is automation.  Even craftsmen like their power tools.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This brings us to the other workflow metaphor: legislation.  A legislative process  is mainly designed to filter out bad ideas.  Legislation is the opposite of manufacturing.  Rather than speeding things up, legislation slows things down.  People complain about Congress being gridlocked or slow but that's the design.  Any wing-nut can draft a bill.  We live in a polarized society so we need all the checks and balances we can get.     What comes out of Congress is hardly ideal but it could be much worse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is doubtful that you work in an organization that has the same diversity of opinion that a country or a state has &amp;mdash; at least in matters of your business.  So it is unlikely that you need an elaborate system of checks and balances.  When companies tend to get hung up is when they envision a manufacturing process &lt;em&gt;as they design a legislative process&lt;/em&gt;.  In these cases, most of the people involved the workflow are reviewers &lt;em&gt;who are only capable of slowing the content down&lt;/em&gt;.  The more steps, the slower the workflow.  These are the workflows that get whittled down until they are single-approval or, in many cases, direct-publish.  If your contributors can create their own content and you trust them to adhere to the voice and standards of the organization, why not?  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are like me and grew up in the U.S. in the 1970's, you probably remember that School House Rock cartoon about a bill and his journey through Congress to become a law.  The bill complains about waiting around and getting sent from one place to another.  I embedded the video.  Watch it and imagine the bill as your content.  Painful, right?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;iframe width="425" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/nlka6fTnDnI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;This high failure rate with workflow gives a lot of credibility to people who dismiss workflow as being oversold.  The workflows that you see in product demos suggest you can choreograph your ad-hoc processes into an efficient assembly line.  It presupposes an opportunity for specialization which requires people to be dedicated to a specific task.  That isn't going to fly in most organizations until there is enough demand for content to justify building a factory.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Do you notice anything different?</title>
    <content type='html'>If you use Blogger, you know that they have been increasingly aggressive about converting users to the new "Beta" platform.  Initially it was a "pssst, we have something new!" accompanied by warnings of once you go Beta, you can never go back.   Recently they put in an interstitial page making it easier to upgrade than to go to the old tried-and-true version.  Well, this time, I took the plunge and I upgraded.  If you haven't done so yet, you have the following to look forward to:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The "Blogger Buzz" feed on the dashboard&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="return false;" tabindex="7"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A text field on the edit post page where you can put in tags&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A better post list page.  Here you can apply tags to a bunch of posts at a time&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Faster publishing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They will merge your Blogger account into your Google account&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;No earth-shattering improvements but no trauma or drama either.</content>

    <title>Magnolia 3.5 CE Now Final</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Magnolia 3.5 Community Edition is now GA. It will probably be a little while before the Enterprise Edition is final. But at least it is on the horizon. See &lt;a href="http://contenthere.blogspot.com/2007/11/magnolia-community-edition-35-rc1.html"&gt;my earlier post for a list of what is in the release&lt;/a&gt;. The big differences between Enterprise and Community Edition are Magnolia's Site Designer (a WYSIWYG editor for developing display templates), a JSR-168 (portlet spec) connector, the option to use Day's CRX rather than Apache JackRabbit for a repository, and, of course, the ability to buy support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content>

    <title>Plone Live Review</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I have been reading &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plonelive.com/"&gt;Plone Live&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; by Michel Pelletier and Munwar Shariff of CIGNEX Technologies and I highly recommend it.  Plone Live is one of several professionally published books on Plone.  Other books include Andy McKay's &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://plone.org/documentation/books/definitive-guide"&gt;The Definitive Guide to Plone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, Julie Meloni's &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://plone.org/documentation/books/cm-essentials"&gt;Plone Content Management Essentials&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, and Cameron Cooper's &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://plone.org/documentation/books/building-websites"&gt;Building Websites With Plone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;.  &lt;i&gt;Plone Live&lt;/i&gt; fits into this existing ecosystem by providing information for more advanced Plone developers ready to take Plone to the next level to build highly customized, performant applications. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The introductory sections are noticeably thin but I think that is OK because books like &lt;i&gt;Plone Content Management Essentials&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Definitive Guide to Plone&lt;/i&gt; deliver pretty well in this area. You might have seen an earlier &lt;a href="http://contenthere.blogspot.com/2005/06/new-plone-book-plonelive.html"&gt;blog entry&lt;/a&gt; where I was critical of the choice of chapters selected for preview on &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0976553406/qid=1123257627/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1/103-0659088-4508647?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.  After reading the book, I feel even stronger about that point because these sections are not representative of the book's quality and usefulness.  In fact, I would consider donating those chapters as Wiki articles on &lt;a href="http://www.plone.org"&gt;Plone.org&lt;/a&gt; so that the community can maintain and enhance them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Plone Live&lt;/i&gt; starts to deliver its value beginning midway through chapter 2 with a road map of what is where in the Zope Management Interface (ZMI).  Because Plone is so customizable and the ZMI is not specifically designed to manage a Plone site, it is easy to get disoriented with all the folders and other objects that need to be manipulated in order to customize and extend Plone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best parts of &lt;i&gt;Plone Live&lt;/i&gt; are the sections where it discusses security and the comparative benefits of File Based vs. Through the Web (TTW) development.  While most books focus primarily on TTW development, Plone Live's authors make the point that this customization method is primarily for rapid prototyping and is no way to build a robust application because of performance and deployment considerations.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.plonelive.com"&gt;PloneLive website&lt;/a&gt; was built as a file based Plone Product and is available for download.  There are a number of other downloadable example products available on the website as well.  I would like to see a little more information on best practices for developing and debugging File Based applications such as when you need to restart Zope and when you don't, how a team of Plone developers should work together on a Plone project (source control, etc.).  However, this is a good start with advice about using Selenium as a function testing tool and other best practices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Plone Live&lt;/i&gt; also covers common integrations such as relational databases, LDAP, Apache, and using WebDAV and XML-RPC to integrate with other architectures.  For each of these topics, &lt;i&gt;Plone Live&lt;/i&gt; provides step by step instructions that are easy to follow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Plone Live&lt;/i&gt; contains many references to other good resources including books, websites, and extensions.  The book is written in a very "open source" way in that it recognizes the value of the community and is inclusive of rather than competitive with other resources.  &lt;i&gt;Plone Live&lt;/i&gt; also leverages is the open source concept of frequent releases.  &lt;i&gt;Plone Live&lt;/i&gt; is a &lt;a href="http://www.plonelive.com"&gt;Live Book&lt;/a&gt; published by &lt;a href="http://www.sourcebeat.com/"&gt;Source Beat&lt;/a&gt;.  For $29.95, you can subscribe to Plone Live for a year and get access to a constantly updated version of the book.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The critical area where &lt;i&gt;Plone Live&lt;/i&gt; lacks is in the A to Z index.  Plone Live does not have one.  If you subscribe to the Plone Live book, I am sure this is not a problem since there is probably search.  However, I think it is an issue with the paper version.  This is the first Source Beat book that I have read so this might be a format constraint imposed by the publisher.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on all this, if you have been playing around with Plone or have been using it for a small work group solution, and you want to get serious, pick up Plone Live.  You will be glad you did.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Socialnomics Video</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;If you have not already done so, you should definitely watch the promotional video for the book &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00472OBYI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00472OBYI&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=contenthere-20"&gt;Socialnomics: How Social Media Transforms the Way We Live and Do Business&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=contenthere-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00472OBYI" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?index=11&amp;amp;list=UULC9cX5GntaQmTSF6hTqrzA&amp;amp;hl=en_US" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;I haven't read the book yet but the video has some pretty intense statistics.  This may not revolutionize your content marketing strategy but it will certainly shake your confidence in the status quo.  I hope this doesn't make executives snap to the reactionary decision of "we need to get on Facebook."  It would be much better for someone to think "we need to deliver a product/service that people want to rave about."  If you can do that, those customers will be gushing about you on whatever social network is currently popular with the customers you want to reach.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>CRX and Tar PM</title>
    <content type='html'>Thomas MÃ¼ller has a &lt;a href="http://dev.day.com/microsling/content/blogs/main/tarpm.html"&gt;blog post that nicely describes how the Tar PM works&lt;/a&gt;.  Tar PM is the fastest of &lt;a href="http://www.day.com/content/day/en/products/crx.html"&gt;Day CRX's&lt;/a&gt; pluggable persistence managers.  The speed of Tar PM is a major reason why some companies go with the CRX rather than the free JCR reference implementation &lt;a href="http://jackrabbit.apache.org/"&gt;Apache JackRabbit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The key to Tar PM's speed is that it only supports write operations and these operations just append the new data to the end of one big file (a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar_(file_format)"&gt;TAR&lt;/a&gt; file actually).  What content objects are stored where is recorded in an index which is also read-only.  To prevent limitless growth of the data file, you need to periodically run maintenance programs that compress the file be removing deleted records.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This may seem very familiar to those of you who have managed systems built on &lt;a href="http://zope.org"&gt;Zope&lt;/a&gt; (like &lt;a href="http://plone.org"&gt;Plone&lt;/a&gt;) and have had to "pack the database" - an operation that does essentially the same thing as the CRX tools plus remove unneeded intermediate versions that were defensively saved during transactions.  From my experience with Zope, I know that having a huge, single file database can be scary but not necessarily dangerous.  What do you do if you have a corrupt record in the middle of the file that causes the maintenance tools to crash?  Usually there is some way to fix it but you need access to the experts.  The only issue is that Zope and CRX experts are not as easily found as Oracle, MySQL, or MSSQL experts.  Tar PM seems to improve on the ZODB by switching to a new TAR file after a certain point.  Longtime readers of this blog may remember my ZOracle Series (part &lt;a href="http://blog.contenthere.net/2005/12/zoracle-part-i-problem.html"&gt;I&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://blog.contenthere.net/2005/12/zoracle-part-ii-solution.html"&gt;II&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://blog.contenthere.net/2005/12/zoracle-part-iii-connecting-zope-to.html"&gt;III&lt;/a&gt;) that described a project to point the Zope Object Database (ZODB) to an Oracle database.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although both Zope and Day have customers with huge repositories, the general rule of thumb is to keep things small when you can.  In the ZODB world there are extensions that store large binary files outside of the database.  In the JCR world, the strategy is to segment content into smaller repositories.  For example, if you have lots of publications, put each one into its own JCR instance rather that combine them all into one.  Companies that pursue this type of segmentation need to have some component in the architecture that can look across repositories and maintain collections of references to show an aggregated view.  At the simplest level, this can be a search engine.  At a more advanced level there could be hierarchical taxonomy system with references to items in different repositories.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This strategy runs against Oracle's vision of all your company's content neatly organized in one big database.  I would argue that putting everything in one place does not necessarily mean that it is well managed or easy to find.  More important than how the content is physically stored is that it is cohesively organized (that is, content that belongs together is stored together) and that there are uniform ways to access it.  This is the strategy of the JCR and it plays well with service oriented architecture where different applications (services) that manage their own data can be combined to support cross-application business processes.   When you have everything in the same database, the tendency is to do your integration at the data level (which can be brittle and proprietary) rather than the application (or service) level.  I won't deny that it is handy to have a database that can scale infinitely in size and there are applications that need very large storage (like archival systems).  But trying to keep things small and segmented has its virtues as well.  I am reminded of the frequently made point that storage is cheap but finding and managing the information can be very expensive.</content>

    <title>Reconsidering Email</title>
    <content type='html'>While Microsoft Word is undeniably a poor content production tool for all the obvious reasons (poor separation of content and presentation, non standard formats, instability, etc.), it is amazing how much textual content starts out in Word.  Even content management gurus and purists can't resist the automatic impulse to fire up Word before they start typing even for things like blogs (as an aside, I am loving &lt;a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/"&gt;MarsEdit&lt;/a&gt; as an offline blogging tool).  They accept the effort that it takes to strip out all the MS Word cruft for the convenience of working in a familiar word processing tool.  As much as I hate to admit it, Word is everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there is another little text editor that everyone likes to use and that is an email client.  Many of my colleagues just start typing in an email as the most convenient way to capture information.  After they are done, they can decide whether to turn it into an email or paste it in another application to manage it as content.  Email clients usually have basic word processing functionality like a spell checker and simple formatting. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Readers of this blog know that &lt;a href="http://contenthere.blogspot.com/2006/05/email-and-content-management.html"&gt;I have been very critical of email as a collaboration tool&lt;/a&gt;.  My complaints of email center on email's failure as a repository (what you get is a lot of duplication but very little retention).  But as a text editor, I actually like email because it is focused around a standard.  Email editors, even the WYSIWYG HTML kind, try to limit the amount of non-standard formats that they produce because they have no idea what kind of reader will be accessing the message.  Of course, many users undermine this benefit by writing Word documents and then emailing them.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some CMS have tapped into email as an authoring tool and probably many more have been customized to extend the native functionality to incorporate email for content entry.  The functionality is most commonly found in blogging tools.  For example, &lt;a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Blog_by_Email"&gt;WordPress has a commonly used blog-by-email configuration&lt;/a&gt;.  One of the better out of the box implementations from a full blown WCM that I have seen is &lt;a href="http://www.gossinteractive.com/cms"&gt;GOSS's iCM product&lt;/a&gt; which allows users to mail in their articles.  The iCM processes the article based on who it is from and puts in a workflow to be prepared for publication.  Some users can have the rights to publish directly from email (or an SMS). You don't see GOSS outside of the UK as they are a regional vendor specializing in government clients.  The knowledge management product Intraspect (acquired by &lt;a href="http://www.vignette.com/us/Products/Collaboration"&gt;Vignette&lt;/a&gt;) had a nice feature where every folder in the repository had its own unique email address.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to see this feature implemented more frequently.  It would be especially useful for simple, article based content types where the subject field maps to the title, the "from" field is translated to a byline, body == body, and attachments could be treated like related images or files.  Anyone else know of WCM products that do this particularly well? I know &lt;a href="http://drupal.org/node/39172"&gt;Drupal has a configuration to enable this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content>

    <title>New Blog: Lionbridge CTO Corner</title>
    <content type='html'>I am writing about multilingual publishing on a new blog called "&lt;a href="http://content.lionbridge.com/category/cto-corner/"&gt;CTO Corner&lt;/a&gt;."&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://content.lionbridge.com/systems-integrator-needs-know-multilingual-publishing/"&gt;This is a rich topic that many content management professionals never get exposed to&lt;/a&gt;. One of my hopes for this blog is to bring in experiences from others who are immersed in building and maintaining multilingual websites. Software vendor perspectives about managing multilingual content are welcome as well. If you would like to share,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sggottlieb"&gt;@message me on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and we can set up an interview.</content>

    <title>cmf2007: Content Camp</title>
    <content type='html'>I am counting down the days until November 6th when I will be in Aarhus, Denmark attending &lt;a href="http://www.cmf2007.dk/"&gt;cmf2007&lt;/a&gt;.  I have wanted to go for the past two years but could not justify the trip while working within a U.S. focused company.  This year &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net"&gt;Content Here International&lt;/a&gt; is going to be there in full force.   My schedule will be full too.  On Tuesday, I will be &lt;a href="http://cmf2007.dk/tutorial/12"&gt;teaching a tutorial on open source content management and portal technologies&lt;/a&gt;.   On Wednesday, I am going to present a session on &lt;a href="http://cmf2007.dk/development"&gt; different patterns for deploying a web content management system&lt;/a&gt;.  For a sneak preview, I explore some of the concepts in &lt;a href="http://contenthere.blogspot.com/2007/06/cms-deployment-patterns.html"&gt;this blog post&lt;/a&gt;.  On Thursday, I am moderating &lt;a href="http://cmf2007.dk/open_source"&gt;a track on open source CMS&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What makes CMF conferences different from other events on the circuit is that there is much more interaction.  In most conferences, people pop-in, give their presentations and then jet out.  At CMF, you have all the &lt;a href="http://cmf2007.dk/speakers/"&gt;big names&lt;/a&gt; and everyone hangs out together at well organized social events.  So, if you can't get your question in as the speaker is disconnecting from the projector and packing up his laptop, there are many other opportunities over drinks and food.   Hopefully, I will see you there too.</content>

    <title>Browser support</title>
    <content type='html'>Someone recently pointed out to me that my blog layout does not display correctly on MSIE6 and I am embarrassed to say that I didn't check the &lt;i&gt;other&lt;/i&gt; browsers when I applied the new style.  I should have because 29% of my last 100 visits have been by people using IE6.  In &lt;a href="http://contenthere.blogspot.com/2006/01/new-look.html"&gt;Steve Zimmerman's&lt;/a&gt; defense, the problem is not really with the template.  The non-wrapping code samples in my "ZOracle" posts make the right column shift down to the bottom where it is safe.  The Gecko engine, used by Mozilla and Firefox, allows the code samples to run over the right column.  For now, I think I am going to leave it.  MSIE users will have to scroll down to the bottom for the navigation until the ZOracle posts fall out of scope.  Untill then, have I ever told you about a great little browser called &lt;a href="http://www.mozilla.com/"&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt;?</content>

    <title>What is a Content Management Assessment?</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Most organizations who struggle with content management blame their CMS for their woes.  The only hope for relief they see is to replace the platform and start over. But without fully understanding the true nature of the issues, an expensive CMS replacement project is not likely to improve anything; it could even make matters worse.  It is highly likely that the CMS doesn't need to replaced and better results can be achieved by reconfiguring the current platform and adjusting roles and processes.  As &lt;a href="http://www.iantruscott.me/throwing-the-vendor-baby-out-with-the-implementation-bath-water"&gt;Ian Truscott so eloquently confesses&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Having seen plenty of examples over the years of web content management replacement projects and a common perception that any problem is a tools problem.  Also, I confess having been in sales situations as a vendor that have preyed on the fact that an organization perceived that their incumbent product couldn’t do x, y or z when, in truth you can be fairly sure something has gone wrong along the way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before you go into CMS selection mode, consider a content management assessment that takes a holistic view of your content management tools and processes.  It highly likely that you could be using your current tools more effectively.  If that is the case, your organization can solve its content management problems with much less expense and risk.  A content management assessment covers a lot of the same ground as a CMS selection but leaves open the possibility that the best platform may be the one that you are already on.  If it turns out that you do need to replace your platform you have a head start in a selection because you will already understand your requirements and will some made some operational improvements.  Otherwise, you will have a nice list of enhancements that you can use to tune your current tools and processes and achieve better results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the first in a series of articles that explains different aspects of a content management assessment.  The following articles will dive into questions one should ask in a content management assessment and how to get to the correct answers.  These topics will also help new implementations avoid problems before they occur.  Stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>CMS Selection Workshop</title>
    <content type='html'>Last week I was a panelist in a &lt;a href="http://jboye08.dk"&gt;jboye08&lt;/a&gt; session called "Running a Web CMS procurement." &lt;a href="http://jboye08.dk/speakers/jarrod_gingras"&gt;Jarrod Gingras&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="http://cmswatch.com/"&gt;CMS watch&lt;/a&gt; moderated the panel that also included &lt;a href="http://jboye08.dk/speakers/graham_oakes"&gt;Graham Oakes,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://jboye08.dk/speakers/piero_tintori"&gt;Piero Tintori&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://jboye08.dk/speakers/soren_sigfusson"&gt;SÃ¸ren Sigfusson&lt;/a&gt;.  It ran for 90 minutes and, quite frankly, we barely scratched the surface.  I must admit, I share the blame because I used my 10 minutes just to ask the audience a bunch of questions (&lt;a href="http://www.slideshare.net/sggottlieb/questions-for-a-wcms-selection-presentation/"&gt;see slides&lt;/a&gt;).  Fortunately, I will have an opportunity to do justice to the topic when I present my &lt;a href="http://gilbaneboston.com/pre-conference_workshops.html#workshop-a"&gt;"How to Select a Web Content Management System" workshop&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="http://gilbaneboston.com"&gt;Gilbane Conference in Boston&lt;/a&gt; next month on Tuesday December 2nd.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the years of doing CMS selections, I have refined my approach to address the specific challenges that are unique to web content management.  In particular: &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The huge number of products to choose from and the lack of a clear market leader&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The different sources of content technologies: commercial, open source, SaaS, and custom&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The flexibility of these platforms&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The importance of usability&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The spanning of technical and organizational concerns&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The different uses of web content management software&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Web 2.0 and now Web 3.0&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The fact that the platform winds up being a component of a larger solution that includes implementation, process, management, and support&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;And the wide range of processes that organizations use to manage their content.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have written extensively about selection on this blog &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2006/10/selecting-a-cms.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2007/05/how-to-select-a-cms.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2007/09/how-to-make-the-most-out-of-a-vendor-demo.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2008/02/the-rfp-is-dead-long-live-the-rfp.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2007/11/cms-business-case.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2008/02/to-tell-or-not-to-tell.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2007/06/cms-consolidation.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  Here is a chance to put it all together in one (hopefully) coherent session.  If you are already registered for this workshop, please feel free to email me (seth "Ã " contenthere.net) with any specific things you want me to cover.  If you are not already registered, you can do so so &lt;a href="http://gilbaneboston.com/registration_information.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  You can even get a free iPod Touch if you go for the "all in" Conference Plus package.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are going to be in town for the Gilbane Conference but will not be attending any of the workshops, you should consider going to the &lt;a href="http://summit.cmprofessionals.org/"&gt;CM Professionals Fall Summit&lt;/a&gt;, which is also on Tuesday.  I will be &lt;a href="http://summit.cmprofessionals.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=Page.viewPage&amp;pageId=624"&gt;on an expert panel&lt;/a&gt; talking about the content lifecycle but I will be sure to save something for the workshop :)</content>

    <title>Should we start listening to Gartner now?</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I just read Matt Asay's article &lt;a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13505_3-10388091-16.htm"&gt;"Time to upgrade upgrade open source perceptions of Gartner"&lt;/a&gt; where he gives Gartner credit for finally getting open source.  His point is that Gartner has stopped steadfastly arguing that open source's impact was negligible.  On that point, I have to agree.  Gartner has jumped onto the open source bandwagon just as it was accelerating out of Gartner's reach.  But what does that really mean?  It means that Gartner's readership (predominantly technology vendors) have forced Gartner to cover a market segment that they are no longer able to ignore.  It also means that some of the &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2009/10/open-core.html"&gt;open core&lt;/a&gt; software vendors have gotten big enough that they now represent a decent market for Gartner reports and services.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From a technology customer's perspective, the value of Gartner's (and most of the other major analysts, for that matter) opinion is pretty much the same.  Main stream technology analysts focus on the business of technology (market share/cap/potential) &amp;mdash; not the design or suitability of the products.  Market analysts don't work with the technology.  They don't talk to users or developers.  Half of the people they talk to are CIOs who couldn't identify the user interface of the software they are discussing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, if you are a software company or an investor trying to figure out where to spend your money, Gartner's reports just got a little bit more useful.  If you are in the market to buy technology, Gartner won't help you understand  your requirements and what product is the best fit for your organization.  &lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Double International Snapshot</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Last year I wrote a post about &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2013/02/preventing-source-language-bleed-through.html"&gt;two deployment patterns to prevent source language bleed through&lt;/a&gt; when using a &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2012/02/introduction-to-translation-proxies.html"&gt;transaction proxy&lt;/a&gt;.  If you don't want to click through on the link, source language bleed through can happen when a visitor views a page with text that has not been translated yet.  Most translation proxies have an option to use machine translations for untranslated text but this is not always desirable.  
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our experience, the "International Snapshot" pattern works very well as long as the customer is willing to freeze their content while the site is being translated.  Without a content freeze it impossible to make the site completely translated.  You never know when a content editor is going to publish a new string.  It is also inefficient because the translators might need to translate text that is only on the site for a few hours.  For example, a translator might be sent a task to translate a sentence with a typo that will be corrected in a matter of minutes.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But not everyone is willing to interrupt their publishing flow.  Thanks to the wonderful world of content management systems, people are used to being able to publish whenever they want. To accommodate customers who have no tolerance for bleed through or content freezes, we have started to apply a new pattern that I call the "Double International Snapshot."   This pattern is identical to the "International Snapshot" pattern but has an added layer of a translation instance which effectively freezes the content for the translators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sggottlieb/16688734509" title="Double International Snapshot by Seth Gottlieb, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8592/16688734509_102a7c3eb0.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="Double International Snapshot"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this pattern, you have three instances of the site:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Original Site that is serving your source language visitors today.  This site can be updated regularly for the benefit of source language visitors.  
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A "Translation Snapshot" that is a point-in-time snapshot of the Original Site.  This site provides a stable environment for new content discovery and staging translations.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;An "International Snapshot" that is a point-in-time snapshot of the Translation Snapshot.  This is the site that your target language visitors will hit through the proxy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The translation process works like this.  When you think it is time to refresh the translated sites, you refresh the Translation Snapshot.  This freezes the content for the translators so that they can complete their work without new content constantly appearing.  The Translation Snapshot can be finalized and go through all sorts of testing to make sure that it as perfect as it needs to be.  Once you are satisfied that the Translation Snapshot is production-ready, you refresh the International Snapshot from the Translation Snapshot.  Because the translations for the new content are already in the proxy, there will be no bleed-through.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Double International Snapshot allows content editors to constantly publish new content to the source language site without compromising the stability of the translation environment.  The translated sites can be fully verified for translation completeness and quality before going live.  This pattern is an ideal solution for companies that don't want to risk source language bleed through but are not willing to compromise publishing freedom.  But these benefits are not without cost, you do need to host three versions of your website and you need to build mechanisms for maintaining these snapshots.  The Translation Snapshot site can be relatively low powered because it will get only a limited amount of traffic.  If your site is simple and does not have any runtime server-side logic, both snapshots could be static HTML files hosted on Amazon S3. This can be done pretty easily with &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2012/01/fun-with-static-publishing.html"&gt;GNU wget&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Talk about lock-in! How about a WordPress tattoo?</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://lorelle.wordpress.com/2009/02/09/first-ever-permanent-wordpress-tattoo/"&gt;Lorelle VanFossen posted the first known permanent WordPress tattoo.&lt;/a&gt;  I guess (tattoo recipient) &lt;a href="http://www.bakershours.com/"&gt;Ed Morita&lt;/a&gt; didn't read my post on &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2004/12/cms-exit-strategies.html"&gt;CMS exit strategies&lt;/a&gt;.  As with most CMS implementations, the feedback has been mixed.  Comments on Lorelle's blog range from "Woah! I think itâ€™s a good tat! And it is a great location" to "Oh dear I hope that is fake cos that is the lamest tattoo ever!"  However, unlike most CMS implementations, which are planned to be in place for less than 5 years, Ed's tattoo should last a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Plone Strategic Summit results posted</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Notes and action items from the &lt;a href="http://www.openplans.org/projects/plone-strategic-planning/project-home"&gt;Plone Strategic Planning Summit&lt;/a&gt; were just &lt;a href="http://plone.org/events/2008-summit/"&gt;posted on the plone.org site.&lt;/a&gt; The notes are still a little rough and only hint all the information that was shared and there is still work to do to organize and plan the execution of these ideas. Probably the most informative page is &lt;a href="http://www.nabble.com/Strategic-Planning-Summit%3A-Next-Steps-td15431896s6745.html"&gt;the next steps email&lt;/a&gt; sent by &lt;a href="http://limi.net/"&gt;Alex&lt;/a&gt;. This email contains pointers to a &lt;a href="http://dev.plone.org/plone/report/10"&gt;bunch of Trac tickets&lt;/a&gt;. Every one of them has an owner (or "champion") to push them forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content>

    <content type='html'>Seth, I agree that Facebook Connect could be a boon for personalization efforts in 2011.  I think it solves a fundamental problem that&amp;#39;s plagued prior personalization initiatives- a lack of data.  When you look closely at the Graph API, you see there is an amazing amount of data, both about an individual visitor and their social graph.  I presented a session at Gilbane Boston on a concept I call Social Context http://www.slideshare.net/twentworth12/social-content-and-social-publishing.  You might also enjoy this piece from Ad Age which discusses the Levis example you reference http://adage.com/digital/article?article_id=145982.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think in 2011 we&amp;#39;ll also see more vendors provide adaptive personalization capabilities, where the site gathers visitor behavior in real time and personalization occurs without the reliance on authored business rules.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Let&amp;#39;s revisit this post in 2012, because I do think you&amp;#39;ll see big changes in personalization in 2011.</content>

    <title>CM Professionals Summit - Boston 2006</title>
    <content type='html'>I am back at work after attending the &lt;a href="http://www.cmprofessionals.org/events/summit/us-2006-fall-cm-summit"&gt;2006 Fall CM Pros Summit&lt;/a&gt; and the Boston Gilbane Conference. I think that most would agree that the CM Pros Summit was the best ever (Gilbane was also very good but that is another post). We set a record for number of attendees. The speakers knew their stuff and the audiences were all very engaged. See some photos &lt;a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/cmprosfall06summit/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Adriaan Bloem, blogged everything he saw on the &lt;a href="http://cmprosbenelux.org/2006/11/27/cm-pros-fall-2006-summit-content-management-and-the-world-enterprise"&gt;CM Pros BeNeLux blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I thought that my round table on &lt;a href="http://contenthere.blogspot.com/2006/11/levels-of-localization.html"&gt;Levels of Localization&lt;/a&gt; went well. I am collecting materials for an area on the &lt;a href="http://www.cmprofessionals.org"&gt;CM Professionals website&lt;/a&gt; (check out the new look) that describes the levels and shows some examples. I will announce here once something is up.</content>

    <title>OpenCms Eclipse Plugin</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://www.redstardevelopment.nl/opencms/opencms/en"&gt;Dave Schoorl&lt;/a&gt; just announced on the &lt;a href="http://www.opencms.org"&gt;OpenCms&lt;/a&gt; mailing list his new &lt;a href="http://www.redstardevelopment.nl/opencms/opencms/en/opencms/plugin/"&gt;Eclipse plugin for OpenCms module development&lt;/a&gt;.  This plugin provides direct synchronization with OpenCms's virtual file system.  Lack of WebDAV support for the VFS has made developing code for OpenCms a little awkward because you develop locally and then need to figure out some way to push it to the server.  Dave's plugin handles the synchronization behind the scenes so you don't have to worry about it.  OpenCms Version 7 (currently in Beta) includes WebDAV support but there is still great value of having an Eclipse plugin because it sets the foundation for lots of other developer conveniences.  This is the strategy that many commercial CMS products are taking: rather than try to build your own stand alone IDE, sit on top of a solid foundation that is familiar to most developers.</content>

    <title>James Robertson&amp;#39;s Rule of CMS Usage</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;James Robertson has a great post called &lt;a href="http://www.steptwo.com.au/columntwo/robertsons-rule-of-cms-usage/"&gt;James Robertson's Rule of CMS Usage&lt;/a&gt;.  The rule is:&lt;blockquote&gt;Over time, CMS usage will head towards the middle of the road.&lt;/blockquote&gt;What it means is that companies typically start out thinking that they have very unique requirements and select elaborate systems to cater to the peculiarities of their process.  Natural selection extinguishes individuality that is not a competitive advantage and companies are left with capabilities that are no longer needed.  A classic example of this kind of unstable situation is where you have a web site that looks very average but is managed by exceptionally complex systems and processes. In James's words:&lt;blockquote&gt;The gap between back-end complexity and front-end simplicity quickly became apparent. This has increased the amount of effort needed to create new sites, and to manage the CMS on an ongoing basis. In summary, a greater than average amount of work to publish very average sites.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This kind of suboptimal solution often happens when a software selection is done by a generalist project manager or functional analyst that does not have the perspective necessary to challenge the status quo.  It also happens when the selection is dominated by an expensive software vendor that tries to win the opportunity on flexibility.  In order to make the case for flexibility you need to convince the customer that they are an exceptional case that cannot be supported by a simple solution.  This is why I tend to focus on &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2008/11/leading-requirements.html"&gt;leading requirements&lt;/a&gt; and keep the progress grounded in the practical by pushing back on unconventional requirements that do not add to extraordinary value.  That is not to say that all companies are the same; I love working with a client and discovering something innovative that gives them an edge.  It is just that companies with similar goals are less different than they tend to think they are and can benefit from converging to the "middle of the road."&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Alternatives to Commercially Licensed Software</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Last week, I was in San Francisco at the &lt;a href="http://gilbanesf.com/"&gt;Gilbane Conference on Content Technologies&lt;/a&gt;.  Like all Gilbane conferences, I enjoyed attending the sessions and getting together with my friends in the industry.  &lt;a href="http://gilbanesf.com/gilbane_session_descriptions.html#wcm2"&gt;My panel&lt;/a&gt; was on "Different Approaches to Purchasing a CMS: Open Source vs. SaaS/ASP vs. Licensed." (&lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/presentations/WhenOpenSource_April2007.ppt"&gt;my slides&lt;/a&gt;).  Speaking with me were Kevin Cochrane (VP of Web Content Management at &lt;a href="http://www.alfresco.com/"&gt;Alfresco&lt;/a&gt;) and Jim Howard (CEO of &lt;a href="http://www.crownpeak.com/"&gt;CrownPeak&lt;/a&gt;).  If you didn't make it, here is what you missed....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I lead off with a presentation saying that commercially licensed software, SaaS, and open source software all have their strengths and serve different kinds of customers doing different kinds of things.  I got a good amount of head nodding some good note scribbling but I didn't change anyone's world.  (If you were there, tell me if I changed your world.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then Kevin got up and &lt;span&gt;the man was on fire.&lt;/span&gt;  His presentation was about how traditionally licensed proprietary software was dead and open source was the wave of the future.  He was banging on the podium (so much so that the moderator whose laptop we were borrowing was concerned for her computer) talking about the corruption and arrogance of commercial software.  Kevin was one of the early guys at Interwoven and recently left to join Alfresco so he had the authority of an insider whistle-blower.  He even pulled up a picture of a Gandhi and the quote "First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win."  Kevin got the audience pretty fired up and lots of people were asking how to get Alfresco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think one of Kevin's best points was the different economics of open source software.  Commercial software is a sales driven business.  Sales people stand in between the customer and the software (sometimes creating a barrier) and earn big commissions on every license that they sell (maybe not the $1MM bonuses that Kevin talked about but they can be pretty high because the variable cost of a license is very low).  The open source model uses open source licensing to distribute the software.  Anyone can download it and form their own opinion of whether it is a good fit for their business.  Customers can also decide whether they would get value out of a support and maintenance package that the open source vendor sells.  That said, not all companies are well positioned to participate in this kind of sales process.  Many customers like having sales guys and sales engineers to bring the information to them.  They like someone to do demos for them and to fill out their 30 page request for information (RFI).  I would say that this kind of company would not be a good candidate for open source.   To realize the benefits of open source, you need to be more proactive and can't rely on a sales team to bring the product to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jim talked about how content management vendors should take more responsibility in customers overall success with content management - not just focus on the success of the implementation.  He talked about how companies succeed or fail with content management &lt;span&gt;after&lt;/span&gt; deployment when they are trying to use and adapt the system.  I agree with his point that SaaS is very well positioned to facilitate ongoing success with content management.  They can, for example, monitor who is being naughty and nice with the system or whether the software is being used at all.  Of course, different SaaS vendors are going to provide different levels of hand holding.  Not all customers want or would be able to afford someone observing every action, poised to intercede at the first sign of user confusion. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think open source and proprietary software companies could do a better job providing this support as well.  My old colleague Nathan Rawlins and his employer, &lt;a href="http://www.serena.com/"&gt;Serena Software&lt;/a&gt; published a book Web Content Management for Dummies.  Aside from the fact that all the screenshots are of their &lt;a href="http://www.serena.com/US/products/collage/index.aspx"&gt;Collage&lt;/a&gt; product, the book is product-neutral and has some very good advice.  Open source projects do their part with community generated add-on modules.   Plus, the absence of license costs frees up resources for things like training and coaching.  There is also an opportunity to build communities of business users that might derive a similar benefit to what the developers enjoy.  The Drupal and Plone communities are talking about these opportunities and are having mixed success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jim also raised the very valid point that managing content management systems are expensive no matter what way you slice it.  In addition supporting the infrastructure (servers, rack space in a data center, bandwidth), you also need people who can monitor the system and correct issues as they arise.  Some companies already have these resources.  For example, at Optaros, we already had the infrastructure and the staff who knew the technology.  Those kinds of companies tend to derive less value from the SaaS model because they need to make the investment in people and infrastructure whether they host their CMS or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who were hoping to see contention between the panelists were probably disappointed. No Springer-style bouncers were needed.  Kevin said there are many customers that would do better on a SaaS model than to use open source.  Jim said that SaaS is not for everyone and some companies want the control and responsibility that open source allows. If they do this session again, I hope that the Gilbane folks put someone from a commercial proprietary software company on the panel.  Put Kevin up there with an Interwoven sales guy.  That would be fun.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Mac SVN Clients</title>
    <content type='html'>One of the only things I have been missing on the Mac has been a good &lt;a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/"&gt;Subversion&lt;/a&gt; client.  Yes, there is the &lt;a href="http://subclipse.tigris.org/"&gt;Subclipse&lt;/a&gt; plug-in for &lt;a href="http://www.eclipse.org"&gt;Eclipse&lt;/a&gt; but unless I am doing prolonged Java coding, I don't want to wait for Eclipse to start up.  There is also the command line client but I like a GUI to easily visualize what has changed (yes, I know you can do that on the command line if you can remember the commands).  I was looking for something like &lt;a href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/"&gt;TortoiseSVN&lt;/a&gt; - actually better than Tortoise because Tortoise has the annoying tendency of slowing down Windows Explorer.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a while I was using the &lt;a href="http://www.syncrosvnclient.com/"&gt;Syncro SVN client&lt;/a&gt;.  It came with &lt;a href="http://www.oxygenxml.com/"&gt;Oxygen&lt;/a&gt; and was fine.  A couple of days ago my friend &lt;a href="http://www.spilth.org"&gt;Brian&lt;/a&gt; told me about &lt;a href="http://versionsapp.com/"&gt;Versions&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.zennaware.com/cornerstone/"&gt;Cornerstone&lt;/a&gt;.  I have been playing around with both of them and am really impressed.  Both are really new (Versions is still in Beta) and they feel like native Mac apps.  Versions looks a little like another favorite program of mine: &lt;a href="http://www.culturedcode.com/things/"&gt;Things&lt;/a&gt;.  Cornerstone costs $59 for a single user license.  Versions hasn't announced prices yet. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both Versions and Cornerstone are more powerful than their thin documentation would have you believe.  For example, neither have instructions on how to branch a folder and neither have menu or contextual menu items to execute this action.  However, by holding down the alt key and dragging a folder you can effectively branch.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After going back and forth between Cornerstone and Versions, I am finding Cornerstone a little more intuitive.  In particular, I like how Cornerstone shows how many files you changed in Mail.app kind of style.  Also, I found the notion of "repository" and "working copy" bookmarks a little confusing although I am sure it wouldn't take long to get used to it.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="thumbnail"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skitch.com/sggottlieb/1bmw/cornerstone"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.skitch.com/20080729-fm5s3mk7i1b9uqyx6wprd6ypu.preview.jpg" alt="Cornerstone" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Lucida Grande, Trebuchet, sans-serif, Helvetica, Arial; font-size: 10px; color: #808080"&gt;Uploaded with &lt;a href="http://plasq.com/"&gt;plasq&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="http://skitch.com"&gt;Skitch&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real test will be when I get to merging.  Hopefully one of the two applications will produce some instructions by the time that I need them.</content>

    <title>The Three Worlds of a Product Manager</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;One of the most challenging aspects of being a product manager is that your mind needs to simultaneously exist in three worlds &amp;mdash; three different realities: the present, the near future, and the distant future.  Let's go through them one-by-one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Present&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  This is the state of the product that everyone is using right now.  To the product manager, however, the present feels like the past because it contains features and characteristics that he thought through long ago.  The most relevant function of the present is as a tool to learn more about users and decide what the near future should look like.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Near Future&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  The near future feels like the present because it is the world that the product manager's mind spends most of its time in.  The product manager is looking at mockups and prototypes and thinking about the sequence of when to deliver near future features.  If you follow lean product development, release cycles are short and the actions are pragmatic and concrete.  The picture of the near future is clear enough that it feels like present day.  We do weekly releases so the near future can be real this week, the next, or the week after. If you use feature flags, the near future may be the current state for some users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Distant Future&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  The distant future may not be that far away on the calendar (maybe a few months), but to the product manager, it is science fiction.  The distant future never arrives; pieces of it merge into the near future but the rest keeps on being pushed off.  Because knowledge and priorities are constantly changing, the product manager can't get too attached to the distant future.  More than likely, the product manager is juggling multiple possible distant futures simultaneously in his head.  The whole purpose of the distant future is to put the near future into a larger context and to force the product manager to extrapolate where decisions for the near future may ultimately lead. 
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your product exists in a different state in each of these parallel universes and you need to know  every detail about each of these states because people look to you as the expert.  It is hard to keep these details from getting muddled together in your head and harder still to not confuse others as you talk about the product.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hardest time to avoid confusion is when discussing a product road map.  The best approach is to talk about the near future.  Stick to three months or less with the details weighted towards the first month.  With this horizon you are safe to talk about sequencing and dates but the most important topic is "why?"  You are rapidly responding to an opportunity, testing a hypothesis, or incrementally building towards something bigger. The reason for an enhancement should fall into one of those three categories. Describe the distant future as a vision that influences your general direction.    Don't commit to details or dates.  You just need to paint a picture that shows that the next steps in the journey are worth the effort.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other time when the three worlds confuse stakeholders is when they request a feature.  Often what they ask for fits into a larger vision. For example, they might ask you to fix something that you plan to replace with a different approach.  You need to adjust your perspective to their present (which feels like your past) and then take them through time to show your plans for the near future.  You might also need to take them forward a few releases more to describe how you want that feature to evolve.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Navigating back and forth across the present, near future, and distant future feels a lot like time travel.  It is disorienting when you context-shift into a particular time period and sometimes the past feels a little embarrassing when you come back from the future. Like a hero in a time travel movie, sometimes you need to repair the future by going back into the past.  There is never a dull moment in product management.  If you think things are boring and routine, you need to get your mind over to where the action is.&lt;/p&gt;   </content>

    <title>The Myth of the Occasional CMS User</title>
    <content type='html'>Not long ago, a university hired me to evaluate their CMS implementation.  They were having doubts about their CMS selection because the implemented system was not living up to the lofty promises that got them the budget for the project.  It turned out that they did make a reasonably good platform choice but they failed in two of the other &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2009/08/dimensions-of-success-or-ways-to-fail.html"&gt;critical content management success factors: expectation setting and project execution&lt;/a&gt;.  The project execution wasn't horrible for a first try (they were working with a systems integrator that was new to the platform) and there were some remedial efforts already in progress to clean up the implementation.  What was really killing them was that a primary goal for the CMS was the notion of "self service."  They wanted their faculty to be able to edit their own profile pages.  These faculty pages were more than a simple staff directory.  Each entry was intended to showcase the experience and accomplishments of the professor and included a CV, a career narrative, and a history of publications.  To maximize content reuse, the content model was highly structured — thereby increasing the complexity of the content entry forms.  They might have been able to scale back on the detail but the amount of content they were looking for was not trivial: especially for an individual whose chief concern was not keeping a website up to date.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Often, one of the big justifications for a CMS is removing the webmaster bottleneck and delegating content entry to the people who have the information.  The implicit assumption is that everyone wants to directly maintain their portion of the website but technology is standing in the way.  But if you visit a CMS customer a while after implementation you are likely to find that the responsibility of adding content is still concentrated in a relatively small proportion of the employee population.  Either the CMS never gets rolled out to the anticipated user base or it is rolled out and the user base fails to hold up their end of the bargain so the core content managers take back ownership.  There are plenty of exceptions to this generalization — especially when there is an individual who has taken responsibility for outward (or inward) communication for his/her sub-group.  For example, you might have someone from the human resources department whose job depends on communicating corporate policies to the staff.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You could interpret failed adoption as evidence of poor usability.  That was my client's inclination.  But you need to consider the usability of the other alternative, telling someone else to do add your content for you.  Prior to the CMS, a professor would only have to send a terse, typo-riddled email containing some research references or a CV and the marketing department would clean it up, fill in the gaps, put it in the right style, and handle all of the coordination.  How can you beat that?  You can't.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Usability can't take the place of ownership and responsibility when managing content.  As long as the marketing department owns the website, they will have the motivation to maintain it to the standards that they have set. It would be unreasonable to expect a professor to put the website above his other responsibilities: teaching and publishing academic books and articles.    When the marketing department needs to spend a lot of energy cajoling and coordinating a professor for content, it is usually easier for that marketing department to do the content entry too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Generally speaking, you can't delegate content authorship beyond the perception of site ownership.  A good strategy is to centralize content authorship and give a relatively long turn around time (perhaps 5 business days) for site update requests.  Those who do not feel ownership of the site will be fine with that lag.  But those who are annoyed by the lag (or their staff) are good candidates for becoming content contributors.  To them, using any CMS will be preferable to waiting a week.  If they do complain, their criticism will be about needing more control to produce more elaborate content rather than needing simplicity for basic edits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once you scale back your expectation of distributed authorship, the role of an occasional user gets less important.  The occasional user is certainly less important than the primary content contributor role or the engaged users that prioritize website management in their list of responsibilities.  You shouldn't buy CMS for the occasional user.  You should buy a CMS to maximize the effectiveness of your core users who are primarily responsible for the content and performance of the website.</content>

    <title>Influencer Perks</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;There is a new &lt;a href="http://www.smartmoney.com/spend/technology/your-mortgage-rate-may-depend-on-your-number-of-facebook-pals-1339528231951/"&gt;SmartMoney article about how companies are giving special treatment to customers with high online influence&lt;/a&gt;. Is this really new?  When haven't businesses gone out of their way to cater to and hire people with influence?  Astute local business people have always engaged with their community to know which customers are most likely to be potent references or critics.  The only difference is that social influence is more visible now because it is online and easier to quantify.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last paragraph about how this might not be fair sounds particularly silly when you translate it into the analog world. Yes, of course the owner/chef is going to go out of his way to create a great experience for a local foodie or restaurant critic. It doesn't mean the experience for us introverts needs to be bad.  It just means that there is a bigger upside on extra effort spent on the taste-makers.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Boston Alfresco Meetup - March 12th</title>
    <content type='html'>Russ Danner, from the &lt;a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/"&gt;Christian Science Monitor&lt;/a&gt;, is hosting a Boston Alfresco User Group meeting at the Monitors offices in the heart of Boston's back bay.  This originally modest idea has grown into quite a big event with presentations from &lt;a href="http://www.rivetlogic.com/"&gt;Rivet Logic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.optaros.com/"&gt;Optaros&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.alfresco.com/"&gt;Alfresco&lt;/a&gt; (maybe).  I &lt;a href="http://upcoming.org/event/156427/"&gt;posted the details&lt;/a&gt; of the event on &lt;a href="http://upcoming.org/"&gt;Upcoming.org&lt;/a&gt; but here are the highlights to save you a click:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When&lt;br /&gt;Monday, March 12, 2007&lt;br /&gt;11:00 AM - 3:00 PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where&lt;br /&gt;Christian Science Monitor&lt;br /&gt;200 Massachusetts Ave&lt;br /&gt;Boston, Massachusetts 02115&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parking&lt;br /&gt;$5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lunch&lt;br /&gt;Free if you RSVP to dannerr [at] csps.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content>

    <title>Website Product Manager</title>
    <content type='html'>I often tell my clients that every website needs a "product manager."  This is the person who ensures that the website is meeting the needs of the customers (the audience).  A product manager understands the customer and prioritizes the enhancements of the technical platform as well as the production and maintenance of the content.  The product manager may not have deep technical experience in software architecture, information architecture, writing, or graphic design but needs to bring these disciplines together to create a product that is useful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I have recently come across two very good articles on product management.  The first is &lt;a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2009/03/09.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Program Manager&lt;/em&gt; by Joel Spolsky&lt;/a&gt;.  He calls the role a "program manager" and narrowly focuses on the discipline of software development.  His program manager leads a small team of developers to build an application (or a subset of a large application) by writing a functional specification that defines the product's vision and behavior.    The article nicely describes how the product manager communicates with and manages a technical staff.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second article is &lt;a href="http://www.welchmanpierpoint.com/article/internal-cms-product-management"&gt;Internal CMS Product Management&lt;/a&gt; by David Hobbs.  In his article, David focuses on the &lt;em&gt;web content management system as the product&lt;/em&gt; and the users of that system as the customers.  This role is particularly visible during the initial CMS implementation but is important throughout the system's lifetime to keep it relevant and useful.  Requirements always change — not just when the business &lt;em&gt;changes&lt;/em&gt; but also when it &lt;em&gt;learns&lt;/em&gt; and learning is inevitable with a disruption like a new CMS that may streamline processes and create opportunities.  People change too and they may need different training and/or encouragement as their responsibilities change.  Too many content management systems fail from post deployment neglect.  Always budget for continuing maintenance and enhancement of the system.  Practicing the advice in Hobbs's article will help you avoid those pitfalls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But, as I mentioned earlier, I think that the real &lt;em&gt;product&lt;/em&gt; is the web site itself — not the content management system.  A great CMS is worthless with bad content.  We manage content because it is (or should be) valuable to an audience.  A CMS doesn't make good content, people make good content.  The best a CMS can do is eliminate some of the barriers that prevent users from making good content.  There are plenty of other barriers that the CMS can't eliminate: no time, no interest, no incentives, no skills, etc.  The product manager needs to address these as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I don't think that I am asking too much for a product manager to guide the technology &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; help content producers create good, well organized content.  Wikis are a good example to look to.  Wikis that continue to be successful after their novelty wears off usually have an evangelist that is constantly tracking content updates and giving feedback to authors (Is this page redundant? Does the title make sense? Is the information still accurate? Is it findable?).  When you really think about it, this is the role of an editor in a media and publishing company.  Maybe all companies that manage content (even for internal purposes) should think of themselves as publishers and have editors that push their contributors to produce a worthy product.</content>

    <title>Taxonomy vs Folksonomy</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;We just posted the latest episode of &lt;a href="http://themalcontents.blogspot.com"&gt;The Malcontents&lt;/a&gt;.  This time we hosted &lt;a href="http://www.cmswatch.com/Analyst/15-Regli"&gt;Theresa Regli&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://www.cmswatch.com"&gt;CMS Watch&lt;/a&gt;) and Tim Denby (&lt;a href="http://www.bluevertex.net/"&gt;BlueVertex&lt;/a&gt;) to talk about managing collaborative content.  Based on recent dialogs on the &lt;a href="http://www.cmpros.org"&gt;CM Pros&lt;/a&gt; mailing list, Bryant and I were preparing ourselves for a heated debate.  Collaborative content trends, such as free tagging, are disrupting traditional content management paradigms that are based on formal publishing processes and library science theory.  However, instead of a debate, we got a lot of agreement on when collaborative content can be beneficial and how to manage it.  What was the consensus?  You have to &lt;a href="http://themalcontents.blogspot.com/2007/02/episode-vi-taxonomy-versus-folksonomy.html"&gt;listen&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On an administrative note, you might notice that we moved the podcast on to &lt;a href="http://themalcontents.blogspot.com"&gt;blogspot&lt;/a&gt; so you can subscribe via RSS and listen on &lt;a href="http://www.itunes.com"&gt;iTunes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://podcasts.yahoo.com"&gt;Yahoo Podcasts&lt;/a&gt;.

The audio channel of your feed can also be published to iTunes.  &lt;a href="http://www.odiogo.com/bloggers.php"&gt;Here is how Odiogo works.&lt;/a&gt;  Best of all the service is free.

    <content type='html'>We would like to thank Chris Maresca for raising a valid point in his July 10th comment.  Chris is correct that Bluenog in its SLA does not make attributions to the open source projects it draws from. We do agree that attributions should be made and we have done that in all of the source distributions that our customers receive.  All of the notices and copyrights are indeed preserved in our source repository. However, the attributions were inadvertently missed in the binary distribution.  We have rectified this in our download and we have also added more information on the Open Source Projects section of our website (http://bluenog.com/site/products/content/website/products/opensource) to indicate the open source licenses used in our products. We stand 100 percent behind our products and none of them are licensed to our customers under any of the open source license terms. All of our ICE customers are covered by Bluenog’s SLA.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We remain steadfast in our commitment to add value to all the projects we draw upon and contribute this value back to the community in the form of new features, improvements, how-to’s, bug fixes and more. Our recent announcement (http://www.cmswire.com/cms/enterprise-20/bluenog-contributes-back-makes-open-source-easy-004906.php) on 6/24/2009 was intended to formalize our efforts in this area. Contributing back is a critical part of our relationship with the open source community and we promise to focus on doing this more intently in the future.  We encourage continued constructive feedback from both our customers and the larger open source community.</content>

    <title>Bricolage 1.9 Released</title>
    <content type='html'>The Bricolage Team just &lt;a href="http://www.bricolage.cc/news/announce/2005/08/19/bricolage-1.9.0/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; the release of Bricolage version 1.9.0.  I have not yet test driven this release yet but the notes claim that this releases includes the ability to add related media directly within an element.  This feature answers a common complaint of Bricolage (and many other CMS) that a user must first upload all binary files and then associate them to an article.  There is also an improved  preview functionality where the preview page loads in a frame that allows you to work on a template and reload the results more easily.  Other new features include: a pluggable authentication system, improved LDAP support, a PHP template burner, and the option to use the HTML WYSIWYG editor &lt;a href="http://xinha.python-hosting.com/"&gt;Xinha&lt;/a&gt; which is an active fork of the now dormant htmlArea3.</content>

    <title>Content Management Getting Personal</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;A while back there was an excellent thread on one of the alumni lists that I subscribe to about going "server side."  The general concept is storing as little data on your local work station as possible.  The thread had a great list of free services that you can use.  This is very relevant to me because being a technical person means that I change computers a lot.  When I run Windows, my machine starts to get bogged down after around 6 months of installing and uninstalling software.  Plus, I like to play with different operating systems and hardware.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the services that I rely on:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.blogger.com/"&gt;Blogger&lt;/a&gt;.  As you can tell, I host my blog on blogger.  We have an internal corporate blog but I do most of my blogging here.  Every 6 months or so, I get the idea of hosting my blog myself.  &lt;a href="http://wordpress.com/"&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt; even has a migration from Blogger option.   However, I really like not having to worry about server uptime.  Most people self-hosted blogs that I read have had at least one apologetic post about an outage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bloglines.com/"&gt;Bloglines&lt;/a&gt;.  Bloglines is so much better than any installed blogging software.  I really like being able to go to any computer and check in on my reading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://furl.net/"&gt;Furl&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://my.yahoo.com/"&gt;My Yahoo&lt;/a&gt;.  I only use the bookmarking functionality of my browser if I am working on a project and need to quickly get to the same URLs over a short period of time.  For more permanent bookmarks, I use Furl, which I call my "anti-social" bookmarking service, and the bookmarks on My Yahoo! start page.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We use &lt;a href="http://www.zimbra.com/"&gt;Zimbra&lt;/a&gt; as our mail and calendaring system.  The web client has a AJAX powered, thick client feel but is really slow.  I would love it if they had a light version that was simpler and optimized for common tasks such as reading recent emails.  I think that Yahoo! did a good job by keeping the classic mail interface lean and fast but folding in some cool features (like making dates and places linked to a calendar and maps).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have been a member of &lt;a href="http://www.linkedin.com/"&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt; for ages and am just now starting to realize the power of it.  I get network updates telling me when people I know change jobs.   I don't try to synchronize with my personal address book because of the duplicates issue.  However, I will check LinkedIn when I find that I have a bad address.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If I have large files to share, I usually upload them onto my server and send someone a URL.  I also use services like &lt;a href="http://www.mailbigfile.com/"&gt;MailBigFile&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have used &lt;a href="http://www.basecamphq.com/"&gt;BaseCamp&lt;/a&gt; before but I &lt;a href="http://contenthere.blogspot.com/2006/08/managing-projects-with-trac.html"&gt;think&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/"&gt;Trac&lt;/a&gt; is much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;I am a content management professional and I advise my clients on how to address the threat of services like these.  How do I resolve my own "data independence" with my advice to support institutional&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Back to Blogger</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;In case you noticed something different, I moved this blog back onto the Blogger platform. Actually, Blogger is where Content Here started back in 2004 (Wow! A little over 11 years ago!). Over the intervening years, I converted the site to Wordpress and hosted it on a number of different providers. Some of the formatting shows that the posts are a little worse for wear. &amp;nbsp;And I need to do some theming work. &amp;nbsp;If you notice any other major problems, let me know.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;Data ownership and control were the primary reasons for moving off of Blogger. W&lt;/span&gt;hen my website was a core part of my consulting business,&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;$20.00 per month seemed worth it. Now that blogging is back to being a hobby and Google has a "&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Takeout" style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;Data Liberation Policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;," Blogger makes more sense.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;Moving from WordPress to Blogger definitely feels like going against the grain but this article "&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://google.about.com/od/googleblogger/a/How-To-Move-Your-Blog-From-Wordpress-To-Blogger.htm" style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;How to Move Your Blog from WordPress to Blogger&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;gave excellent instructions plus a good explanation of why you would want to do it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;In addition to great utilities for both Blogger and Wordpress, one of the things that made migration easier was that I hosted all of my images and files on Flickr and other sites. &amp;nbsp;That means that there was less to move.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;My experience so far is that Blogger seems like a less cared for part of the Google ecosystem. &amp;nbsp;It's clunky when compared to Wordpress or other web content management systems that I have used. I am sure that Google+ (and before that Google Wave) have consumed most of the attention. &amp;nbsp;I can't imagine that Google would kill blogger, but if they do, there is always Google Takeout. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

    <title>Lean Product Development with SLCs rather than MVPs</title>
    <content type='html'>I honestly can't think of a better way to build products and services than the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_product_development"&gt;lean product development&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;method. All of the work I have done over the last several years has followed the pattern of growing a customer base around a small simple product that evolves and matures in response to the needs of the users.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Our latest product, &lt;a href="https://ondemand.lionbridge.com/"&gt;Lionbridge onDemand&lt;/a&gt;, has been a great success and yet it started out so small: we were testing whether we could build a business around a self service video translation site. We built the simplest app possible but left room for growth. We leveraged operational talent that Lionbridge already had and an entrepreneurial spirit that was not being satisfied. We tested different ways to drive customers to the site. We got just enough market response to see a path and keep moving forward. Since our first sale, we have been constantly learning, optimizing, and expanding. Now onDemand is &lt;a href="https://www.lionbridge.com/en-us/about/news/lionbridge-ondemand-grows-68-2016"&gt;a thriving business&lt;/a&gt; with a broad range of services. We translate all sorts of content (over 40 file types) into pretty much any language you can think of. We have a &lt;a href="http://developers.lionbridge.com/content/index.html"&gt;public API&lt;/a&gt; and integrations with several popular content management and commerce systems. But most importantly, we have happy customers who rely on the service.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Whenever I want to build a new product, or even add a new feature to an existing product, my plan is to start with an MVP (minimum viable product) and iterate from there. But this article, "&lt;a href="https://blog.asmartbear.com/slc.html"&gt;I hate MVPs. So do your customers. Make it SLC instead&lt;/a&gt;" by &lt;a href="http://blog.asmartbear.com/jason-cohen"&gt;Jason Cohen&lt;/a&gt;, gave me pause. SLC stands for "Simple, Lovable, and Complete" and, after reading the article, I realize that SLCs are the recipe for success in lean product development; not MVPs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Here is the difference. An MVP is (in a pure sense) the flimsiest thing you can build to answer a question about a potential market. The emphasis is more on the "M" (minimum) than the "V" (viability) and most interpret that balance as a semi functional prototype. This kind of MVP is frustrating to customers because it doesn't solve their problem in a helpful way. It focuses on validating that the problem exists and that there is value in solving it. MVPs are selfish because they prioritize research over actual customer benefit.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you really want to learn about customer need, and build good relationships at the same time, you should take one customer problem and solve it well. Build an SLC. I know that the line is blurry here. An MVP could be an SLC if you make lovability a requirement for viability. But often you hear bad solutions as being excused or justified as "just an MVP."&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The first iteration of Lionbridge onDemand did what was needed for a successful, gratifying transaction. In particular:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The customer could upload very large files. This is necessary because video files are big.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The project was automatically quoted so the customer didn't have to wait.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The customer could connect with an online sales agent through chat. This turned out to be a critical feature because we learned so much from our customers during these interactions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The customer could pay for the service using a credit card so he/she got the experience of a seamless, self-service transaction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The operations team was prepared to produce a high quality deliverable in a reasonable timeframe. The customer's need was satisfied.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
While we launched the first iteration of Lionbridge onDemand quickly (less than 2 months from concept to first sale) we took the time to get those pieces right. That was a little over 4 years ago and our first customer continues to do business with us.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
We are constantly adding new features to Lionbridge onDemand and every time we do, we treat it as an &lt;strike&gt;MVP&lt;/strike&gt; SLC. We don't launch the feature unless it makes the user's experience a little better by solving a problem (however small) in a complete and satisfactory way.&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>CMS Pricing</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Over the years, I have had a number of really interesting discussions about software pricing with both vendors and customers.  Pricing software (be it a license fee, an annual subscription price, or whatever other source of revenue) is a complex problem on both sides of the transaction.  Vendors are always trying to tweak their pricing to increase sales and revenue.  Customers are constantly trying to figure out what prices mean in terms of value and overall costs.  The results of these efforts are that prices overly complicated and never seem fair.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the best explanations of software economics is Joel Spolsky's epic article &lt;a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/CamelsandRubberDuckies.html"&gt;Camels and Rubber Duckies&lt;/a&gt;.  To quote:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;One of the biggest questions you're going to be asking now is, "How much should I charge for my software?" When you ask the experts they don't seem to know.  Pricing is a deep, dark mystery, they tell you. The biggest mistake software companies make is charging too little, so they don't get enough income, and they have to go out of business. An even bigger mistake, yes, even bigger than the biggest mistake, is charging too much, so they don't get enough customers, and they have to go out of business.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Joel goes on to talk about microeconomic theory of demand and supply and discusses how software is tricky because there is no intrinsic limit on supply.  Which brings him to the classic Joel conclusion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Take my advice, offered about 20 pages back: charge $0.05 for your software. Unless it does bug tracking, in which case the correct price is $30,000,000. Thank you for your time, and I apologize for leaving you even less able to price software than you were when you started reading this.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As great as Joel's article is, it only focuses on keeping the financials of a software business in the black.  The article ignores another important aspect for software vendors: &lt;em&gt;making customers successful&lt;/em&gt;.  Sure, making a software sale is great.  But to be viable in the long term, a software vendor needs to create value for the customer and then capture a reasonable portion of that value (surplus in microeconomic parlance).  A good pricing model will charge customers in proportion to the amount of value they get from the software, &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2007/11/cms-business-case.html"&gt;but measuring value is not easy in content management software&lt;/a&gt;.  Different pricing models use different data as proxy measures of value.  The problem is that these proxies are not an exact representation of value and customers have an incentive to manipulate them to lower the cost of the software.  To make matters worse, the behavior that prices encourage is often sub-optimal and risky.  Customers consciously underuse or misuse products in order to stay in a lower pricing tier. This undermines the goal of making a customer successful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's dig a little deeper into the unintended consequences of content management software pricing models.  In the world of content management, there are essentially three ways software is priced: by named users, by servers (or CPUs) or concurrent users, and by volume of content.  All of these models try to get customers who use the software more to pay more.  This enables a CMS vendor to sell into small departments as well as make large enterprise-level deals.  But all of these models can encourage bad behavior.  Lets look into each one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By named users&lt;/strong&gt;.  This seems like a great model.  When a customer has lots of users on a system, it means it is leveraging the product for high value things like distributed authoring.  The product likely has become a critical part of many jobs &amp;mdash; making it an important part of the operational infrastructure.  Here the value is that lots of people are able to edit content.  However, I frequently see this model drive customers to do foolish things like having shared accounts on the system (that is, 10 different people log in as a user named "User1").  I have also seen customers have dedicated content entry people to save on user accounts.  If you don't have a user account, you just mail your content to someone who does.  Both of these behaviors undermine all sorts of functionality like workflow and auditing.  Any sense of accountability is gone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By servers or concurrent users&lt;/strong&gt;.  I lump these two models together because they both attempt to tap into the intensity of usage.  This is slightly better than the first option (named users) because it does not penalize customers who have lots of occasional users.  Customers with more activity pay more than customers who are more static.  Here the value is the amount of management activity the software enables.  If the customer's business depends on actively managing its content, the CMS is creating a lot of value.  But these models can encourage users to under-power their implementations.  Customers will low-ball their infrastructure.  When customer buys too few CPU licenses, the system will be slow (what software vendor wants a reputation for being slow?) or there will no fail-over for upgrades or crashes (what software vendor wants a reputation for being unstable?).  When customers have not bought enough concurrent user licenses, I have seen employees repeatedly trying to log in to snatch up a session when one comes available.  What a waste of time!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By content volume&lt;/strong&gt;.  While the first two models are common to all types of enterprise software, pricing by volume of content may be unique to content management software.  I only know of a few vendors that sell this way but, frankly, I think this may be the best of the three options.  Companies with more content derive more value from their CMS &amp;mdash; at least they should.  If a customer has a large volume of low-value content, maybe that is a problem that should be addressed for other reasons.  Additional software fees are trivial compared to the cost of keeping around unneeded content: redundancy, out of date content, and poor findability all add up to great losses in efficiency &amp;mdash; a customer will lose more efficiency to these issues than is gained by having the CMS.  Bob Boiko's book     &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0910965781?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=contenthere-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0910965781"&gt;Laughing at the CIO; A Parable and Prescription for IT Leadership&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=contenthere-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0910965781" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /&gt;&lt;br/&gt; gives excellent strategies for thinking about the value of information.  If high software costs force a better content management strategy, great!  However, things don't always work out that way.  I have even seen customers manage content outside of the content management system (like on a file system or in some other CMS) to avoid having it count against quota.  I have also seen customers model their content to be coarser-grained to reduce the number of items.  For example, rather than create a content item for every glossary term (which would increase reusability) the customer might create one glossary page with terms listed as paragraphs in the rich text editor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of these pricing models have their benefits and risks but they don't necessarily dictate success or failure.  As I often say, a successful software acquisition establishes a partnership that delivers balanced value to both the customer and the supplier.  The pricing model is an important aspect of that partnership because it establishes the terms of exchanging that value.  But like all terms, pricing is negotiable and negotiation works the best when both sides seek a win-win result.  If the customer is sensitive to the vendor's need to generate revenue to sustain its business, and the vendor is sensitive to customer's need to make cost-effective expenditures, mutually beneficial terms can be reached&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Work Breakdown Structure vs. Deadlines</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;One of the most common points of friction between project managers and developers is planning work.  Most programmers hate creating work breakdown structures (WBS).  You can't blame them, accurately predicting steps and effort required to build undesigned software is impossible.  Yes, you heard that right.  Software development planning is impossible &amp;mdash; at least for someone who likes precision, which most programmers do.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem is that every software development project is a unique collection of thousands of tiny details that each have the potential to suck up enormous amounts of time.  The traditional, PMI-sanctioned WBS technique forces developers to name all the activities that will be required, sequence them with dependancies, and then create an estimate of each one.  The assumption is that if you did the planning right, you should just be able to follow the steps and come out the other end on time and on budget.  This also implies that if you didn't blindly follow the steps, the project plan was wrong &amp;mdash; or you were too incompetent to follow the steps correctly.  But with the fluid nature of software development, the project plan is always wrong.  I used to think that precision would increase with finer granularity.  The more lines in the project plan, the more accurate it would be.  But now I think the opposite is true.  The more tasks you add, the more guesses you make and the greater the overall variance.  Even if you guessed every task right, there were probably just as many tasks that you forgot to add.  And there are also lots of steps that you find you didn't need to do too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While predicting a WBS is impossible, developers can get better at setting and meeting deadlines.  There is a small nuance between setting a deadline and estimating tasks in a WBS.  On the outside, the difference is so small that no one will notice.  Nobody will care because they just want to know when the work will get done.  But there is a difference.  The WBS technique forces a linear accounting of all the work that needs to be done.  Creating a deadline is more like adding a constraint (that you hope is reasonable) to help guide and prioritize the work that you wind up doing.  Comparing the two is like comparing launching a rocket to flying a plane.  PMI-style planning is like shooting a rocket: doing all the calculation at the beginning and then hoping that you accounted for everything before ignition.  Setting a deadline turns the rocket into an airplane by adding a pilot that can steer.  Realizing you can make adjustments after take-off transforms the pre-flight calculations from a fixed flight path to a map that you can use to make in-flight decisions.  A deadline (either the final deadline or an intermediate milestone) is where you think you can be at a certain point of time (or after a certain amount of effort).  When creating a deadline for yourself, you don't try to think of every possible task it will take.  It is more like eyeballing distances than counting steps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I became conscious of this distinction the other day when I was on a bike ride.  I take pride in the fact that I usually get home within a few minutes of the time I tell my wife I will be back.  Lots of times I pull in right at the minute.  Putting on my planner hat, if I was asked how long a bike ride would take, I would want to know the exact route and measure the distance and slope and windspeed and make assumptions about average speed.  When I put on my cycling helmet, I realize that most of those variables are under my control.  I can shorten the route.  I can ride faster.  I can take an alternate road to stay out of a headwind.  Because I know my cycling ability and the terrain so well, I make these adjustments without even thinking about it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know you are thinking that software development is not like riding a bike.  There are all these externally imposed requirements, constraints, and dependencies that need to be accounted for.  But think back and ask yourself: how many of these factors are added specifically for the purpose of creating the WBS?  I feel like developers work against themselves by asking for more and more estimation inputs and being more prescriptive of how they will work.  There is no way that every detail can be accounted for and every detail that you do add will constrain your ability to make adjustments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For estimation purposes, requirements should represent boundaries of an acceptable solution.  With this understanding, a developer needs to produce a reasonable deadline based on similar work and explain any assumptions made.  An overall deadline or intermediate milestone shouldn't be overly ambitious.  It should account for unknowns.  If a deadline is not acceptable, scale back the scope until an acceptable deadline can be achieved. Through the course of the project, new information is going to present itself: the client is more particular than he was able to articulate; the available components are not as good as expected; new features are added to the scope.  When any of these things happen, you make adjustments.  You might be able to work a little more efficiently.  You might be able to scale down scope in other areas.  You might be able to delegate work back to the client.  Or, you might just have to extend the deadline.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2009/08/fixed-bid-implementation-work-a-marriage-made-in-vegas.html"&gt;These adjustments require a decent partnership between the developer and the client where the deadline is jointly owned.&lt;/a&gt;  It doesn't work when one party feels like the other is obligated to deliver no matter what.  In the bicycle analogy, when two people go for a ride, they decide where they want to go.  Usually the conversation plays out where one rider asks the other what sort of ride he is up for.  The second rider may say he needs to get back in 2 hours and wants to get in some climbing.  The first rider will suggest a route that he is familiar with.  When they encounter construction that makes a road impassable, they may be able to find an alternative route that is just as good; they can hammer home over a longer route in a &lt;a href="http://www.lostrivercycling.org/paceline.html"&gt;paceline&lt;/a&gt;;  or they can call home to say that they are going to be late.  Whether the first rider should have known about the construction is debatable (Did the construction just start? Was the overall distance to ambitious?  Did the route not allow for adjustments?) but debating is not going to get anyone home sooner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With experience, you do get better at making more realistic deadlines.  And, more importantly, you also get better with time management.  You will build an awareness of where you are in the overall process and know early if you are falling behind schedule.  In the cycling analogy, you periodically glance at the clock, your current speed, the slope of the road, and which way the wind is blowing.  In software development, you are looking at things like the calendar, the productivity, and the rate of defect identification.  With this information rolling around in your subconscious, you start thinking about options instinctively.  The client perception is that you planned well.  But you really didn't.  You managed time well.  The up front estimate was just one of the many constraints that you juggled when developing the solution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Drupal 7 UI: Be Part of the Solution</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;As I have mentioned before, &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2009/01/drupal-7-usability.html"&gt;the Drupal project takes a very conscientious approach to usability&lt;/a&gt;.  Unlike many commercial and open source software projects, &lt;a href="http://drupal.org"&gt;Drupal&lt;/a&gt; enlists the help of usability labs and is very receptive to negative feedback.  That is not to say that Drupal has achieved usability nirvana.  They struggle with it like everyone else - especially as they try to add functionality and flexibility into the system.  It is just that they practice their usability work so out in the open.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is an opportunity to see the Drupal usability process first-hand by participating in this &lt;a href="http://acquia.com/blog/mark-boulton-lesia-need-our-help"&gt;call to action from usability consultants Mark Boulton and Leisa Reichelt&lt;/a&gt;.  There are several ways to participate.  For more details, visit &lt;a href="http://www.d7ux.org/"&gt;http://www.d7ux.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Web Content 2007 and Enterprise 2.0</title>
    <content type='html'>I will be &lt;a href="http://www.webcontent2007.com/programsDetails.html#open"&gt;presenting&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="http://www.webcontent2007.com/index.html"&gt;Web Content 2007&lt;/a&gt; conference in Chicago next month.  This is a  first  time conference with a great &lt;a href="http://www.webcontent2007.com/speakers.html"&gt;speakers list&lt;/a&gt;.  If you &lt;a href="http://www.gifttool.com/registrar/ShowEventDetails?ID=1208&amp;amp;EID=1536"&gt;register&lt;/a&gt; before June 1, you save a hundred bucks.  Hopefully I will see you there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of days later, I will be on an &lt;a href="http://www.enterprise2conf.com/conference/foundations-for-enterprise-20.php#1182322800"&gt;Enterprise Search panel&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="http://www.enterprise2conf.com/index.php"&gt;Enterprise 2.0 Conference&lt;/a&gt; in Boston.  I think this one is going to be interesting because my co-panelists all come from search software vendors.  There is an interesting tension between the content management market and the search market.  Content managers and information architects focus on organizing  and structuring content to make it more usable, accessible, and findable.  Nirvana for search vendors is not having to care about how the content is organized and stored.  Of course, everyone can agree that the content must be worth finding.  That may be the common ground that we can all start working from.</content>

    <content type='html'>Good point Travis.  It really depends on the system.  Most CMS provide pretty good tools for safely reviewing content on the production instance of the application.  However, the ability to safely test templating code (and content type definitions, workflow definitions, etc.) on production varies widely from platform to platform.  I agree that bad content can be dangerous.  One of my prior clients is an online sports book and publishing the wrong odds can cost millions of dollars in seconds.  An editor can also do something silly like put an unclosed object tag in a persistent content element (like a header) and make every page on the site go white.  Inadvertent assignment of permissions on a piece of content can yield embarrassing results too. That said, I think there is a higher margin for error in code.  Or, maybe its just my code ;)</content>

    <title>Migration tools are marketing, not technical, tools</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Jeff Potts, in his blog &lt;a href="http://ecmarchitect.com"&gt;ECM Architect&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://ecmarchitect.com/archives/2006/01/23/646"&gt;makes an excellent point&lt;/a&gt; about how migration tools are usually over-sold by software marketing organizations.  Jeff rightly says&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The *problem*&amp;#148; is, Notes/Domino [and I would extend this to any real CMS platform] is often used to develop complex, highly-customized applications. For those, there's probably no getting around a complete re-development effort if they are to be moved at all.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best one can hope to do is migrate the content and success will depend on the quality of the content.  If the content is well structured, it is often possible to use automated migration logic to map fields from one repository to another.  If the content is just free text, the best you can do with automation is to push the content into an equally unstructured system.  Of course, then your pristine new system will be as cluttered as your original system - probably more-so since much of the organization that was implied through navigation will be lost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not to scare you, but if you are switching platforms, be prepared for the cost of migrating your data, as well as training and loss of productivity. James Robertson of &lt;a href="http://www.steptwo.com.au"&gt;Step Two&lt;/a&gt; sets some realistic expectations in his article &lt;a href="http://www.steptwo.com.au/papers/cmb_spendingcms/index.html"&gt;Spending Patterns During CMS Implementation&lt;/a&gt;.  On the bright side, this work often forces critical business decisions and activities that directly improve the way content is managed within an organization.  For example, deciding how long to keep around content, eliminating redundant or outdated content,  organizing content more effectively, establishing ownership and processes for content....  If you want to be successful in this initiative, you would do this work anyway.  Otherwise many of the problems that hampered the original system would be ported to the new system where they would be equally problematic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Kevin Cochrane Joins Day</title>
    <content type='html'>I was just on the &lt;a href="http://www.day.com"&gt;Day Software&lt;/a&gt; site and noticed that Kevin Cochrane (who had left &lt;a href="http://www.interwoven.com"&gt;Interwoven&lt;/a&gt; to join &lt;a href="http://www.alfresco.com"&gt;Alfresco&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;a href="http://www.day.com/site/en/index/company/press_center/press_releases/day_accelerates_growth.html"&gt;joined Day as their Chief Marketing Officer&lt;/a&gt;.  This seems like a great fit.  Kevin can contribute to Day's already very strong commercial open source strategy (&lt;a href="http://www.day.com"&gt;Day&lt;/a&gt; is a primary contributor to &lt;a href="http://jackrabbit.apache.org/"&gt;Apache JackRabbit&lt;/a&gt;) and will probably help Day build a U.S. presence.  Day's focus on web content management is much greater than Alfresco's so Kevin will probably enjoy more influence in the Day culture.  The big question is whether Kevin will bring with him some of his other Interwoven/Alfresco team.  Day already has a star-studded technology team and a &lt;a href="http://www.day.com/content/site/en/index/solutions/content-centric_infrastructure/content_repository.html"&gt;very strong, standards based content repository&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am looking forward to seeing Kevin's contributions at Day.</content>

    <title>Alfresco Developer Series</title>
    <content type='html'>I was just reading Jeff Pott's &lt;a href="http://www.alfresco.com"&gt;Alfresco&lt;/a&gt; article "&lt;a href="http://ecmarchitect.com/images/articles/alfresco-content/content-article.pdf"&gt;Working with Custom Content Types&lt;/a&gt;" and it is one of the best developer guides on Alfresco that I have read.  The article goes through the creation of content types in a step by step narrative with some pointers to other interesting facts along the way.  Jeff is hosting a &lt;a href="http://ecmarchitect.com/alfresco-developer-series/"&gt;whole series of these articles on his website&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="http://ecmarchitect.com/images/articles/alfresco-webscripts/web-script-article.pdf"&gt;The Web Scripts introduction&lt;/a&gt; is also very good.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a vendor neutral analysis of Alfresco's general utility in web content management, I am offering my Alfresco evaluation from &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/products-page/reports/open-source-content-management-in-java"&gt;Open Source Web Content Management in Java&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/products-page/reports/open-source-content-management-in-alfresco"&gt;stand-alone report&lt;/a&gt;. The report covers Enterprise Edition version 2.2, which is due out any day now.</content>

    <title>Radio Silence</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;You might have noticed that I haven't been posting here much over the last year.  More likely, you haven't noticed at all.  Blogs are often like that.  They come and go depending on the whims of the blogger.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason for my silence is that my focus has shifted from pure content management to lean product development, web application development, and cloud-base architecture.  At Lionbridge, I have been helping to build a business called &lt;a href="https://ondemand.lionbridge.com"&gt;Lionbridge onDemand&lt;/a&gt;. It has been a little over a year since our first sale and I am in a constant state of amazement about how things &lt;a href="http://www.lionbridge.com/lionbridges-ondemand-platform-doubles-revenue-adds-98-new-clients-since-launch-late-2013/"&gt; are growing&lt;/a&gt;. Like most of my projects, we followed a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_product_development"&gt;lean product development&lt;/a&gt; model of launching a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product"&gt;minimum viable product&lt;/a&gt; and continually improving it to support the needs of our growing customer base.  In this case, we started with a tiny website to translate videos. Since then we have grown to the point where:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;We now have a wide array of services that support nearly 40 different content types. We even have services that do not involve translation at all such as proof reading and CRM data cleanup.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are enterprise sites for many name-brand clients. It turns out that large organizations are full of individuals who prefer a simple consumer style eCommerce experience. With onDemand Enterprise, we can quickly create a custom site for a corporate account.  These enterprise sites have the same simple "consumer" feel but they also have the ability to offer custom services and can tap into corporate payment channels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We have a &lt;a href="http://api-docs.liondemand.com"&gt;Public API&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href="http://developers.lionbridge.com/"&gt;developer program&lt;/a&gt;.  We started with an API for eCommerce systems to translate product catalogs; but then we grew into a full featured translation API that can handle our full complement of content types.  While there are other translation APIs out there, ours is unique because it exposes different translation services ranging from pure machine translation to professional translation by subject matter specialists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We are now a global team working around the clock to deliver projects with industry leading quality. We have operations specialists in North America, Europe, and Asia. Managing a service like this requires a special mix of problem solving skills.  This is content management at a level of complexity that I have not seen before. The process requires the constant attention of highly skilled and conscientious individuals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last point is my favorite. I am currently en route from Warsaw, Poland where I have spent the last five weeks working with the operations core team. It was an incredible experience to meet the people that I had only known through email and conference calls. From the start, I was impressed by their dedication and can do spirit.  Now they feel like family.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, back to this blog.  What has made Content Here a worthy endeavor so far was that it provided a useful place for me to explore observations and concepts that I encountered as a content management professional. If I learned something, I would flesh out my knowledge by writing it here.  If I did a decent job of explaining something to someone, I would reproduce that explanation here.  If that was all blogging did for me, it would have been enough.  But blogging provided so many more benefits. In particular, it was a way to connect with other people.  I made many business connections and friendships with this blog.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am hoping that I can continue experiencing these benefits by shifting the focus of this blog to be more aligned with my day to day work. It won't be a total departure from my older posts.  My involvement in web development and open source software has stayed the same.  But I will probably write a lot less about content management software, product selection, taxonomy, workflow, and other pure content management concepts.  To be honest, I feel like there is not much more for me to write on those topics.  There will be more posts about my experiences from growing a web business.  Topics will include things like working with distributed teams, lean product development, customer support, web application development, and web operations.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, along the way, I will meet new people who are struggling with these same topics.  The web is a pretty big place so I think that chances are good.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Digital Asset Management: Inventory or Production?</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I have been doing a lot of work in digital asset management (DAM) over the past several months.  One thing that strikes me about digital asset management software is that a majority of the market focuses on solving the problem of organizing and finding digital assets rather than the problem of producing assets.  This is understandable.  After all, digital assets (like images, videos, and audio recordings) pose a real problem for organizations.  Digital assets are bulky (take a lot of storage), hard to find (at least without metadata), and expensive to produce (you need software, skills, and most importantly, taste to develop these things).  Without a digital asset management system, these valuable assets get lost in a chaos of local and shared folder structures with no identifiers other than arbitrarily assigned file names.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The promise of alleviating the pain of losing and duplicating digital assets is compelling and has driven growth in the DAM segment of content technologies.  DAM also nicely complements Web Content Management (WCM) because digital assets are so often used in web publishing.  In fact, you see lots of WCM platforms integrating with DAM software or adding light DAM capabilities (basically a folder structure of assets with searchable metadata) to their solutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what of the other side of management?  The DAM market is considerably weaker in solving the problem of managing the production of digital assets.  Products that were designed as digital libraries typically lack robust functionality for workflow, versioning, and managing the raw materials that are required to generate digital assets (filters, fonts, effects, etc.).  This type of functionality is critical for large marketing departments within global organizations that are constantly producing, localizing, and publishing digital assets such as videos, images, banner ads, and flash movies.  This was the business problem I was trying to solve.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After some research, I found two products that excel in managing digital asset production: &lt;a href="http://www.adamsoftware.net/"&gt;ADAM&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.vyre.com/"&gt;Vyre&lt;/a&gt; (I am looking forward to seeing Vyre's new &lt;a href="http://onbrand.vyre.com/workflow/"&gt;Creative Workflow product&lt;/a&gt;).  I shied away from Documentum for other reasons.  &lt;a href="http://www.day.com/day/en/products/digital_asset_management.html"&gt;Adobe CQ DAM&lt;/a&gt; probably has the most promise for digital asset production because of its upcoming integration with the market-dominating Creative Suite (&lt;a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/bridge.html"&gt;Bridge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/adobedrive.html"&gt;Drive&lt;/a&gt; in particular).  That said, when you buy CQ DAM today, you are getting more of a platform than a DAM application.  The "Press Center" application, which Adobe demos as its DAM, is essentially a website (built on CQ WCM) for browsing digital assets.  The building blocks for digital asset production (versioning, workflows, triggers, etc.) are all there, but it takes a lot of services work to build a digital asset production management system.  Look for some changes in the upcoming 5.5 release.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another interesting technology in this area is &lt;a href="http://www.saepio.com/"&gt;Saepio MarketPort&lt;/a&gt;.  The best way to describe MarketPort is that it is like those websites that allow you to build your own greeting card, photo-book, T-Shirt, or mug.  You select a template and then input text and images to fill the placeholders.  But instead of creating a T-Shirt or mug, you are creating a marketing asset like a flyer or banner advertisement.  This is great for franchise or distributed companies that want to empower their subsidiaries with self-service creation of marketing assets.  But it is very different from the creative workflow that I was discussing earlier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is also a category of software called &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing_resource_management"&gt;Marketing Resource Management (MRM)&lt;/a&gt; but I found that market to be fragmented and poorly defined.  The products that claim to be part of the MRM segment do very different things.  Some focus on planning and reporting. Others focus on project management.  The content repository functionality in these products tends to be on the weak side.  Plus, they tend to require large amounts of implementation work to deploy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DAM (and MRM) market is broad and can be confusing.  The good news is that if you are just looking for a system that will centralize the storage of digital assets and allow users to easily organize, find, re-use, and repurpose existing assets, there are a lot of viable options.  You can focus your selection on aspects such as usability and price.  But if you are looking for a platform to coordinate a large team of digital asset producers, the market gets a lot thinner.  When evaluating DAM products, make sure that you know what scenarios you are trying to support.  Demonstrations of search, renditioning, and cropping are compelling; but do they do not fully address the needs of a large, specialized production team. &lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>What Game is your Team Playing?</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I am trying to get a friend of mine to quit his job.  No, I don't want him to join the massive ranks of the unemployed. I want him to move to a job that appreciates his talents and efforts.  My friend (let's call him Bob) is totally dedicated to his profession. He is continually trying to improve his skills and productivity and wants to help his colleagues achieve better results too. Nobody brings more thought and interest to any task he faces.  But he is surrounded on all sides by people who just don't care.  They are satisfied by doing mediocre work. If something they build doesn't immediately fall over, they consider it done. If they can assign responsibility to someone else, they will.  If nobody else notices a problem, it never happened.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's frustrating for Bob.  He can't accomplish his goals without help or at least cooperation.  His company doesn't recognize the difference between his performance and that of his peers.  In fact, he is constantly getting passed over. It doesn't feel fair. But it is fair. Bob is just playing the wrong game.  Queue the metaphor...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine that you are a world class tennis player.  You live and breath tennis.  You go into every volley trying to do your best and to improve upon the last one.  You invest in coaching and resources to improve your game.  If something might help you play better, (like a different diet, a different racket, or even one of those magnetic bracelets) you will try it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One day, a friend challenges you to a game of Wii Tennis.  You start to play tennis as you know how.  Your knees are bent.  You move your feet.  You swing with explosive power.  You are playing great tennis...  but you are losing.  You look over and you see your friend.  He is slumped on the couch barely moving his controller with a flick of wrist.  He looks like he couldn't walk across a tennis court without losing his breath.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As pathetic as he looks, Wii thinks your opponent is a better tennis player.  Wii doesn't care about his form, his position, or how much leverage he has over the ball.  Wii only cares about timing and maybe a couple other factors.  Your friends knows this and he is not wasting any energy on what Wii doesn't care about.  Your friend &lt;em&gt;is the better Wii Tennis player&lt;/em&gt; because he has figured out how to do less but still satisfy the minimal inputs that Wii has been programmed to observe. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bob is trying to play real tennis in his company's Wii Tennis tournament.  He is not exactly losing, but he should be winning.  The frustrating part is that he could be doing a lot less and get the same results.  When he is on a team, he is constantly questioning whether he should be compensating for others by fixing their work &amp;mdash; like in a doubles game when you see your partner is not running so you cover more of the court.  His extra efforts only result in bumping into things and annoying people who just want to "sit on the couch and casually wave their hands."  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now the big question: who is playing the wrong game?  It is difficult to tell if Bob's company would perform better if it paid attention to the finer aspects of how people worked and measured performance more holistically.  It is unknown whether the company's customers would appreciate a higher quality product.  But there are two things I know.  1) Bob wants to play real tennis, not Wii Tennis.  2) He doesn't have the clout to change the game that the rest of the company is playing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason why I am writing this post on this blog is that I think that this story is very relevant to the pursuit of any type of organizational change, be it adopting Agile development or Enterprise 2.0. Companies can delude themselves into thinking they are playing a different game than they actually are.  They may think they have a bunch of real tennis players who are striving for excellence and victory on a dynamic playing field; instead, they have a bunch of Wii tennis players who are looking for ways to minimize their personal/professional investment to only what is recognized.  These companies get confused when they put a tool or way of working out in the wild and nobody adopts it; they shouldn't be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organizational change is much harder with the Wii Tennis company because you have to actively incentivize every behavior you want to see.  It is not enough to say "this will make our company more effective."  You have to say "do this specific thing and get points towards your performance review;" and you better not be lying because Wii Tennis players will see right through that.  Finding real tennis players like Bob is hard to do &amp;mdash; especially if you work for a large company.  Real tennis players need a lot of room to move around and large companies tend to compartmentalize people.  They need to be challenged in different ways to keep things interesting.  Their rewards need to be tied to company achievement.  Plus, other employees will get annoyed when you change the game that they have gotten so good at.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When building a company or even just a team within a company, think about what game you are playing.  If your industry is commoditized and the difference between average and excellent is under appreciated by the market, it may pay to go after the Wii Tennis players and be very specific about expectations and incentives.  If you are competing in a dynamic industry with a large upside, build a team of competitors who will take ownership of optimizing their personal performances and also the effectiveness of the overall team.  They will innovate and try new tools and techniques that are offered.  Most importantly, they will not stop a practice if it is difficult to do &amp;mdash; they will only stop if it is ineffective or if they find something more effective.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Alfresco Moving to the GPL</title>
    <content type='html'>Alfresco recently &lt;a href="http://www.alfresco.com/legal/licensing/whitepaper/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that it will be moving their Community Edition from the &lt;a href="http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/MPL-1.1.html"&gt;MPL (Mozilla Public License)&lt;/a&gt; + Attribution to the &lt;a href="http://www2.blogger.com/gplv3.fsf.org"&gt;GPL (v3)&lt;/a&gt; with an FLOSS exception that makes it easier to for other open source software with a &lt;a href="http://www.opensource.org/"&gt;OSI&lt;/a&gt; certified open source to use Alfresco as a component.  Version 3 of the GPL is not quite fully ratified yet so there might be some slight changes in Alfresco licensing depending on where the GPL lands.  The license change will affect the 2.0 release of Alfresco and apply to any software downloaded after February 20, 2007. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For most companies using Alfresco, the shift to the GPL will not have much impact because the Enterprise Version (which Alfresco recommends you buy if you are using the product in production) will carry a commercial license that is distinct from the GPL.  I don't know the ins and outs of how the Alfresco commercial license interacts with the licenses of the underlying open source components that Alfresco is built on (&lt;a href="http://www.springframework.org/"&gt;Spring&lt;/a&gt; (Apache License), &lt;a href="http://www.hibernate.org/"&gt;Hibernate&lt;/a&gt; (LGPL), &lt;a href="http://myfaces.apache.org/"&gt;MyFaces&lt;/a&gt; (Apache License), etc.). However, I would stay that Alfresco has too much to lose and access to too much legal advance to do anything in violation of those open source licenses. Alfrescians, please feel free to weigh in here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you who have been keeping score, this is the third major licensing incarnation that Alfresco has gone through.  Originally, they had a limited featured Community Edition and sold an Enteprise Edition that consisted of the Community Edition plus proprietary extensions.  Then they open sourced the entire application but made the community edition badge-ware.  This latest model is more akin to &lt;a href="http://www.mysql.com/"&gt;MySQL's&lt;/a&gt; dual license.  And MySQL seems to have built a &amp;lt;understatement&amp;gt;nice little business for itself&amp;lt;/understatement&amp;gt;.  My colleagues and I have been secretly hoping that Alfresco would move in this direction and I am very happy that they have because I think it makes more sense for everyone.</content>

    <title>Open source project filtering</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Roberto Galoppini has an &lt;a href="http://sosopensource.com/187.html"&gt;interesting case study on selecting an open source project management tool.&lt;/a&gt;  In it, he describes his &lt;a href="http://sosopensource.com"&gt;SOS Open Source methodology&lt;/a&gt; for filtering open source projects by looking at a number of factors organized into three categories: sustainability, industrial strength, and project strategy.  The case study doesn't go into much detail but Roberto has built a tool that aggregates quantitative and qualitative project information   from a number of disparate sources and builds scores.   I saw a demo around 6 months ago and was impressed by the graphs he was able to create. While this technique cannot be expected to make a technology decision for you (you need to know your requirements and to have hands-on experience for that), it can be used to filter down the market and help you decide where to invest your evaluation energy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite its ubiquity, open source software is still unchartered territory for most technology buyers.  That is not to say that most companies don't use open source software, nearly all companies leverage at least open source utilities, libraries, and infrastructure (operating systems, databases, web servers, etc.).  Many companies use open source business applications too.  It is just that many companies adopt open source technologies in haphazard and spontaneous ways &amp;mdash; at least not with the same level of conscientiousness put into an expensive commercial software purchase.  While &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2009/12/the-content-here-map-of-the-information-market.html"&gt;I don't think buyers should put much stock in Gartner's or Forrester's opinion of technology&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2009/11/should-we-start-listening-to-gartner-now.html"&gt;it barely exists for open source technologies&lt;/a&gt;.  That point was hammered home in a &lt;a href="http://www.olliancegroup.com/pdfs/CIO_Webinar_invite.pdf"&gt;recent a Olliance webinar&lt;/a&gt; when one of the panelists said that Gartner and Forrester offer &lt;em&gt;no value on open source&lt;/em&gt;.  All the CIOs on the panel leveraged their peers and internal experts rather than their analyst subscriptions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ideally, technology procurement should be able to sense if there is something wrong going on with the project.  The information is out there and you can get it in real time (as opposed to commercial software companies that only report quarterly).  You just need to know where to look.  Tools like SOS Open Source provide a useful high level picture to quickly highlight potential issues that should be investigated.  It is unlikely that mainstream analysts will be able to develop this level of awareness for open source projects so I think there is great opportunity for these data aggregation tools.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>WYSIWYG Editors</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;WYSIWYG editors are a key feature in most CMS products: both commercial and open source. These components add HTML controls to a web form field so that a non-technical user can apply their own formatting to the text that they enter. I think of WYSIWYG editors as being &lt;a href="http://www.cyberlearning-world.com/nhhs/amrev/begin.htm"&gt;The Great Compromise&lt;/a&gt; of content management. WYSIWYG editors balance the needs of the authors, who would rather use something like MS Word to enhance their prose with formatting, and systems people who want structured data to store and reuse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the commercial world, the leader is &lt;a href="http://www.ektron.com/ewebeditpro.aspx"&gt;Ektron's eWebEditPro&lt;/a&gt; which is OEM'ed in &lt;a href="http://www.interwoven.com/"&gt;Interwoven Teamsite&lt;/a&gt; and many other commercial CMS products.  On the open source side, there are many projects including &lt;a href="http://www.dynarch.com/projects/htmlarea/"&gt;htmlArea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://kupu.oscom.org/"&gt;Kupu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.blogger.com/%20http://bxe.oscom.org"&gt;BXE&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://xopus.com/"&gt;Xopus&lt;/a&gt;.  Both BXE and Kupu are hosted on &lt;a href="http://www.oscom.org/"&gt;OSCOM&lt;/a&gt; and there is some code sharing between them. Most WYSIWYG editors are based on Javascript to be cross browser compatible although not all are tested on both IE and Gecko based browsers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago I was setting up &lt;a href="http://www.bricolage.cc/"&gt;Bricolage&lt;/a&gt; to work with htmlArea (which is integrated with Bricolage and several other open source CMS) and was surprised to see that the latest version (3.0) was no longer available on the &lt;a href="http://www.htmlarea.com/"&gt;htmlArea&lt;/a&gt; website.  I learned from the list that &lt;a href="http://www.interactivetools.com/"&gt;InteractiveTools&lt;/a&gt; is no longer maintaining the code and the project has moved to &lt;a href="http://www.dynarch.com/projects/htmlarea/"&gt;DynArch.com&lt;/a&gt; (thanks, Bret Dawson for the answers). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then last week, there was an interesting discussion on the OSCOM mailing list about htmlArea losing momentum and other emerging editors. Drupal has shifted from htmlArea to &lt;a href="http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/"&gt;TinyMCE&lt;/a&gt; and has a &lt;a href="http://drupal.org/node/16118"&gt;module&lt;/a&gt; to integrate &lt;a href="http://www.fckeditor.net/"&gt;FCKEditor&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;a href="http://www.xoops.org/"&gt;XOOPS&lt;/a&gt; is now using &lt;a href="http://www.koivi.com/WYSIWYG-Editor/"&gt;Kiovi&lt;/a&gt;.  Some simple editors such as &lt;a href="http://www.themaninblue.com/experiment/widgEditor/"&gt;widgeEditor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.kevinroth.com/rte/demo.htm"&gt;Cross-Browser Rich Text Editor&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, all of these WYSIWYG editor projects (like many Javascript projects) are pretty small and it is hard to tell where they are going. On the plus side, it is not a great risk to maintain these Javascript libraries on your own if you find one that meets your needs today. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want a list of HTML Editors and the the browsers they support, check out the HTMLArea &lt;a href="http://www.htmlarea.com/directory/WYSIWYG_Editors/index.html"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Open Source CMS and Google Summer of Code 2006</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Google recently &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/summerofcode.html"&gt;posted its 2006 Summer of Code List&lt;/a&gt;.  Here are the the OS CMS projects that will be mentors:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://lenya.apache.org"&gt;Apache Lenya&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bricolage.cc"&gt;Bricolage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://cocoondev.org/daisy/index.html"&gt;Daisy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://drupal.org"&gt;Drupal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.joomla.org"&gt;Joomla!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://moinmoin.wikiwikiweb.de"&gt;MoinMoin (wiki)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://plone.org"&gt;Plone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bricolage.cc"&gt;Wikimedia (wiki)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bricolage.cc"&gt;XWiki (wiki)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;If you use one of these applications, now is the time to contribute or lobby for enhancement ideas.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Art of Community Now Available</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.jonobacon.org/"&gt;Jono Bacon's&lt;/a&gt; new book &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596156715?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=contenthere-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0596156715"&gt;The Art of Community: Building the New Age of Participation (Theory in Practice)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=contenthere-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0596156715" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /&gt; is now available.  &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2009/02/the-art-of-community.html"&gt;I first heard about this book in January&lt;/a&gt; and I have tracked the progress and discussion on and off since then.  As you would expect from a book about community, the development of &lt;em&gt;The Art of Community&lt;/em&gt; was a very open process.  I must say that I was a little underwhelmed by the activity around the book given the interest in the topic.   Number 1 on the list of top 10 commenters had 29 comments.  Number 10 had 7.  Maybe most of the discussion happened over Twitter where &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/jonobacon"&gt;Jono has over 2,400 followers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have no doubt that the book will sell well.  Doesn't everyone want to start a community?  I just ordered my copy and will post a review here when I get through it.  The incumbent for my favorite book in this category is &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0674018583?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=contenthere-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0674018583"&gt;The Success of Open Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=contenthere-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0674018583" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /&gt; by Steven Weber.  Clay Shirky's &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1594201536?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=contenthere-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1594201536"&gt;Here Comes Everybody: The Power of Organizing Without Organizations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=contenthere-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1594201536" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /&gt; is also quite good.  Both of these books effectively describe the community phenomenon.  What may set &lt;em&gt;The Art of Community&lt;/em&gt; apart is a set of instructions for creating your own successful community (Jono draws from his experience with &lt;a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/"&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.kde.org/"&gt;KDE&lt;/a&gt;).  But if the techniques work so well, why hasn't the community around the book thrived?  Did Jono (who also works as community manager for Ubuntu and is a musician) not have adequate time to write the book implement his techniques?  &lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Who Isn&amp;#39;t Working on a SharePoint Killer?</title>
    <content type='html'>I talk to a lot of web content management software vendors and open source project leaders and it seems like most of them are working on some kind of "knowledge worker collaboration portal" - a &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/Sharepoint/default.mspx"&gt;SharePoint&lt;/a&gt; killer.  At first they avoid this comparison (nobody likes to openly challenge &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; on its home turf;  even now in the era of "I'm a PC, I'm a Mac").  But eventually, they admit that is exactly what they are doing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To be honest, I don't blame them.  There is something very compelling about building a knowledge worker collaboration portal.  Portal technology has been a solution looking for a problem [&lt;a href="#sharepoint1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;].   Knowledge worker information management (&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_management"&gt;"knowledge management"&lt;/a&gt;) has been a business problem that has confounded technology for ages and only seems to get worse as the sea of unmanaged information grows.  A "knowledge sharing portal" is a logical union of solution and problem and the success of SharePoint practically proves it.  Who doesn't want a piece of that action?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/38298452@N00/3231882518" title="View 'Ingeniux Cartella' on Flickr.com"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3127/3231882518_4fab4a5b0f.jpg" alt="Ingeniux Cartella" border="0" width="500" height="300" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ingeniux.com"&gt;Ingeniux's&lt;/a&gt; new &lt;a href="http://www.ingeniux.com/Cartella-Social-Software.xml"&gt;Cartella product&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Still, this does not mean that information management problems are on the verge of extinction.  Even SharePoint's most ardent advocates concede that companies cannot cleanly codify all of its corporate intelligence with SharePoint alone.  That takes governance, discipline, and investment beyond technology.  But since implementing technology is always easier than affecting profound organizational change, there will always be a market for tools that promise miraculous results - just as there is always a market for easy weight loss programs and pills.  These false promises of quick fixes have kept technology companies in business for years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Even though market demand is huge, competing against SharePoint is not easy.  For small to medium size companies and (especially) non-profits, it is hard to beat SharePoint on price.  It is also hard to make the case about proprietary technology and lock-in to a potential customer that lives in Microsoft Office (as most knowledge workers do).   Right now, alternatives to SharePoint are most attractive to companies that want to avoid building competencies in managing Microsoft servers and .NET development.  It is going to take some bigger disruptions to minimize Microsoft's competitive advantage as a collaboration tool for the mass market.  The big thing to look out for is a reduced supremacy of &lt;a href="http://office.microsoft.com"&gt;Microsoft Office&lt;/a&gt; file formats.  This could be from an increased adoption of the &lt;a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=office"&gt;Open Document&lt;/a&gt; format or it could be through a transition to "file-less" server side information storage like wikis or &lt;a href="http://docs.google.com"&gt;Google Docs&lt;/a&gt;.  Until that happens, SharePoint killers will have the biggest success with companies that are reducing their use of Microsoft technologies on principle and with very large companies that are punished by Microsoft's per user licensing model.   This is still a sizable market but hardly a threat to MOSS's core territory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notes:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[&lt;a name="sharepoint1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;] I can't even count the times that clients have initially used the word "portal" to describe their projects and later find that what they are looking for is just a regular informational website.  Not a portal.</content>

    <title>Architecture Aikido</title>
    <content type='html'>Over the past year I have been doing some side work building a web application for a startup. The project has been very interesting and the process has helped me stay in touch with my inner developer. It has also allowed me to practice &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2010/05/tips-for-web-product-management.html"&gt;agile product management philosophy&lt;/a&gt; to an extreme.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Last week I read Andy Hunt's article "&lt;a href="http://pragprog.com/magazines/2011-05/guru-meditation"&gt;Uncomfortable with Agile&lt;/a&gt;" and I have been ruminating on that feeling of being in a constant state of discomfort. If you click through and read the article, you will learn that discomfort is a good thing. The alternative is blissfully trusting a process — and then finding that you were wasting your time. Agile revolves around challenge. You challenge your assumptions and your limitations. That discomfort that you feel is really the sense of awareness that everything is in play and you are personally are accountable for a successful outcome.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recently, I have been feeling like architecture in an agile environment is a little like wrestling or aikido. The goal is to maintain your balance and stay on your feet. Your opponent (the customer) pushes requirements in one direction and you respond by building up the architecture in that area like you might move your feet to stop yourself from being knocked over. Then, all of the sudden, the customer changes direction and you need to quickly adjust. The trick is to never over-commit in one direction or the other. Over-committing will put your balance at risk because, if the direction of force changes, all your weight will be on the wrong foot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We see over-committing in architecture all the time. You go in thinking one feature will be the center of the application but then you find that little thing you built on the side as an afterthought is the killer feature. This is especially true with startups that are constantly "pivoting" or redefining their product. In my experience, most over-commitment sins are done in the name of performance optimization. You structure the data or the code in such a way that you can cut some corners and shave some processing time. Sometimes these optimizations are absolutely necessary but they leave you exposed for the next weight-shift. When this happens, your next iteration is spent regaining the balance of the application (refactoring) rather than adding new features.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The next time you are in charge of the technical design of an agile project, think of it as an aikido match. Fluidly adjust to changing requirements but try to stay away from positions that extend too far from a position of balance. Otherwise plan to take time getting back on your feet.</content>

    <title>Sex doesn&amp;#39;t sell... at least not for FatWire</title>
    <content type='html'>I regretted having to leave the &lt;a href="http://gilbaneboston.com"&gt;Gilbane&lt;/a&gt; conference early because I missed seeing so many friends and colleagues but I had no idea I was missing this &lt;a href="http://totalcio.blogs.techtarget.com/2008/12/03/fatwires-sex-site-demo-backfires-at-boston-web-20-conference/"&gt;FatWire gaff of showing the Playboy as their reference site&lt;/a&gt;.  I am sure that demo would have been compelling to some audiences but it flew like a lead balloon at the Gilbane.  The worst part for &lt;a href="http://www.fatwire.com"&gt;FatWire&lt;/a&gt; was when the &lt;a href="http://www.fatwire.com/cs/Satellite/Page/Main/Company/Company/Management"&gt;CEO&lt;/a&gt; told an offended audience member that she was wrong to be offended.  I guess the age-old rule of presenting still holds:  know your audience.  You can see some &lt;a href="http://snurl.com/74399"&gt;immediate reactions on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.</content>

    <title>I.B.M. to Give Free Access to 500 Patents</title>
    <content type='html'>I noticed this article in the New York Times today.  I not sure what making "software patents freely available to anyone working on open-source projects" actually means but it sounds like a significant change in strategy.  Such a nice reversal from the ridiculous patent squatting practices of the 90's.</content>

    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I didn't see the press release so I was surprised when I opened up the latest piece of junk mail from &lt;a href="http://www.comcast.com/"&gt;Comcast&lt;/a&gt; (I couldn't resist the headline "Business Class TV" .... I still don't know what it means). Comcast is now offering hosted SharePoint and Outlook to their business cable internet subscribers. They are calling the bundle "Microsoft Communication Services" and I think it serves a nice niche of small companies trying to collaborate amongst themselves and with their clients. However, many companies have already solved this problem using the various &lt;a href="http://www.google.com" title="Google"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; applications, &lt;a href="http://www.basecamphq.com/"&gt;Basecamp&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.zoho.com/"&gt;ZOHO&lt;/a&gt;. One interesting difference is that applications like Google Docs, ZoHo, and the hosted wikis take users out of the Microsoft Office Suite while MOSS (for good reason) is tightly bound with Office. The reliance on Office is not so much of a problem for most companies today because they have standardized on the suite. But "Officeless" collaboration is clearly a vulnerability for Microsoft going into the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content>

    <title>My Social Network &amp;quot;Friend&amp;quot; Policy</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;strong&gt;Note: this policy is now being managed on my &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a title="Seth Gottlieb" href="http://www.sethgottlieb.com"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;personal site&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.  Please get the latest version &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a title="Seth Gottlieb Friend Policy" href="http://www.sethgottlieb.com/friend_policy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the past few years I have joined several social networking sites and continue to use a few of them regularly.  These sites serve different purposes for me and I have started to come up with strategies of whom to connect with where.  Here are the general guidelines that I have developed (subject to spontaneous change and arbitrary override).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;On &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, I only "friend" real life friends and family.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;On location based services (like &lt;a href="http://www.tripit.com"&gt;Tripit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.brightkite.com"&gt;Brightkite&lt;/a&gt;), I only connect to people that I would genuinely like to meet up with when traveling and who I trust not to rob my house when I am away.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;On &lt;a href="http://www.linkedin.com"&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;, I only connect with people that I would want to work with.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;I only follow people who inform and/or entertain me on &lt;a href="htt://twitter.com"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://friendfeed.com"&gt;Friendfeed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;I have stopped joining sites like Naymz for which I can't see real purpose.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Well, those are my rules and I'm stickin' to 'em... at least, for now and when I don't forget them (LOLZ).</content>

    <title>&amp;quot;VIBE&amp;quot; on Liferay. Does this portal need a portal?</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I just created an account on a new &lt;a href="http://www.energy.gov/"&gt;Department of Energy&lt;/a&gt; site called &lt;a href="http://vibe.nrel.gov"&gt;VIBE: Virtual Information Bridge to Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy&lt;/a&gt;.  I love the idea.  It is a site that provides data on many of the various energy issues and programs that the &lt;a href="http://www.nrel.gov/"&gt;National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)&lt;/a&gt; is working on.  The site is even powered by renewable energy!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another aspect of the site is that it is running on the Java portal platform &lt;a href="http://www.liferay.com"&gt;Liferay&lt;/a&gt;.  While Liferay is definitely a mature and sophisticated platform, I wonder if using a portal was a good choice for this site.  Like many portal-based sites, VIBE does a good job of putting lots of information on one page but struggles when it comes to navigating and organizing content.  While there is no shortage of menu items on the VIBE site, many of the pages are empty containers waiting for portlets.  If this was a regular content driven site, the navigation could be built up as content was added to the site. I wonder why they just didn't build the site on a more general web application framework.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;This experience reminded me of the narrow range of applications that need a true (as in &lt;a href="http://developers.sun.com/portalserver/reference/techart/jsr168/"&gt;JSR 168 and 286&lt;/a&gt;) portal platform.  When a business owner asks for a "portal" that presents lots of information from various sources, it doesn't mean that a developer should go and start downloading a portal product.  In fact, I would go further to say that unless users &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to select their own portal themes and choose portlets on their pages, you should &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; us a portal product.  The reason why I emphasized the word "need" is that most users will not take the time to customize their own portal page.  I had the ability to create my own personalized page on VIBE but I didn't want to bother.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am seeing a general trend of companies replacing portal-based delivery tiers with simpler technologies.  One such example is the &lt;a href="http://www.jahia.org/cms"&gt;Jahia&lt;/a&gt; web content management platform.  They used to be based on &lt;a href="http://portals.apache.org/jetspeed-2/"&gt;Jetspeed 2&lt;/a&gt;.  Now they just use the &lt;a href="http://portals.apache.org/pluto/"&gt;Pluto portlet container&lt;/a&gt; that allows them to incorporate components that have been implemented as portlets.  One of my newspaper clients replaced their portal based delivery tier for a simple, easier to manage JSP based architecture.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting back to VIBE, I think their best portal strategy would be to not build a portal but rather provide Google and Facebook gadgets that people can use on the sites that they go to frequently.  If a visitor takes any time to customize any portal page, it will probably not be their VIBE page.  The bottom line is that due to their aggregating nature, the world actually needs only a few consumer facing portals.  Far better to focus on producing great information and making it available on the portals that people are already using.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Drupal 7 Usability</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://www.bojhan.nl/usability-testing-at-university-of-baltimore/"&gt;The Drupal 7 Usability Team is doing usability tests at the University of Baltimore&lt;/a&gt;.  Drupal is one of the few open source content management projects that does formal usability testing and &lt;a href="http://boston2008.drupalcon.org/session/report-formal-usability-testing-university-minnesota-libraries"&gt;is so public about the results&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;a href="http://buytaert.net/first-results-from-usability-testing"&gt;Here is a nice short vlog showing Dries' reaction to usability testing done last year on Drupal 6 at the University of Minnesota&lt;/a&gt;. It shows how he took in the information, his surprise, and how he resolved to make adjustments. Also nice heatmap diagram of where the users looked.</content>

    <title>Alfresco and E2CM</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://www.alfresco.com"&gt;Alfresco&lt;/a&gt; has been &lt;a href="http://www.alfresco.com/media/releases/"&gt;tearing up the newswire&lt;/a&gt; recently with announcements and interviews related to their evolved vision that incorporates an Enterprise 2.0 style mash-up/social approach to Enterprise Content Management.  For lack of a better term, lets call it Enterprise 2.0 Content Management or E2CM (a new term!  you heard it here first).  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike the old ECM that was all about monolithic applications to support large, structured, and formal business processes (like check processing or &lt;a href="http://www.fda.gov/"&gt;FDA&lt;/a&gt; approval), E2CM supports the small, informal, ad-hoc interactions that the average knowledge worker engages in every day.  With its flexible, open, and extensible architecture, Alfresco is well suited as a foundation for building and integrating with all sorts of simple tools that facilitate sharing, collaboration, and community.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only concern is that Alfresco is priced high as a framework for building custom applications.  To get the Enterprise Edition (required for support and access to certified integrators), you will probably be looking at an annual subscription fee of well over $60K.  In the age of free frameworks, that is pretty steep.  However, when you look at &lt;a href="http://www.documentum.com/"&gt;Documentum&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www-306.ibm.com/software/data/content-management/"&gt;FileNet&lt;/a&gt; licensing, it doesn't look bad at all.  I guess it all depends on where you are coming from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All this attention to E2CM (when you come up with a new term, you need to use it a&lt;em&gt;LOT&lt;/em&gt;) may be at the expense of the traditional WCM functionality in which Alfresco has lagged.  It takes too much customization to build a simple, semi-dynamic website on Alfresco.  View the source on most of the certified integration partner websites and you will see that they are running on WCM platforms like &lt;a href="http://joomla.org"&gt;Joomla!&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://plone.org"&gt;Plone&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://drupal.org"&gt;Drupal&lt;/a&gt;.  Also, two very senior people from the WCM team (the architect and lead developer that came over from &lt;a href="http://www.interwoven.com"&gt;Interwoven&lt;/a&gt;) have left.  Fortunately for Alfresco, they put in place the core infrastructure like the dependency management, deployment, and virtualization.  There is also a good start on &lt;a href="http://blog.contenthere.net/2008/03/new-web-user-interface-coming-for.html"&gt;some UI improvements&lt;/a&gt; that will work towards market parity.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It remains to be seen whether Alfresco sees traditional WCM as being a market they want to pursue.  Given the competitiveness and price pressure in the market, I understand why they would not want to.  Their advantages as a framework for assembling and integrating E2CM applications outweigh their strengths as a turnkey WCM business application and it makes sense for Alfresco to play to their strengths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content>

    <title>CMS or Portal?</title>
    <content type='html'>The whole reason why you started on this content management initiative is to get the right content to the right users at the right time.  A CMS is not the only software that promises to solve that problem.  In the good old days, many software buyers took an integration approach by presenting CMS managed content through a portal.  However, by building in some content management capabilities, portal applications are moving beyond just presenting content managed within a CMS, to replacing the CMS entirely.  At the same time, content management systems have beefing up their delivery capabilities and providing portal-like functionality that, in some cases, makes a portal unnecessary.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, do you need a CMS, a portal system, or do you still need both?  A few days ago, Bryant Shea and I &lt;a href="http://themalcontents.blogspot.com/2006/11/episode-3-portals-vs-cm.html"&gt;hosted&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://apoorv.info/"&gt;Apoorv Durga&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://janusboye.dk/home"&gt;Janus Boye&lt;/a&gt; to talk about that very topic.</content>

    <content type='html'>Great points Joe.  Mergers 5+ years ago seemed to be more about building complementary suites of products.  If this was the intention, it is now pretty clear that these deals were not put together by technical people who had any architectural vision.  I doubt that the decision makers understood the technology of the products that they were acquiring or had a realistic plan to integrate them.  Whether they earnestly tried or not, these companies were unsuccessful at assembling the solution that they claimed to be aiming at.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think the strategy of the day was probably about keeping up with a changing marketplace and acquiring product categories that seemed hot.  Vignette and Interwoven both felt that web publishing was running out of growth potential.  They wanted to get into enterprise content management because selling a 100,000 seats for an intranet is a more lucrative deal that selling 40 seats to an internet publishing group.  The customers paid the price because these acquisitions shifted these companies away from their core competency and the web publishing products stagnated.  This is why Vignette and Interwoven both entirely missed web 2.0 and felt like an anchor to their customers who were competing against agile start-ups with more nimble technology.</content>

    <title>Google&amp;#39;s Take on the Newspaper Business</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Chief Google Economist, Hal Varian, has an interesting &lt;a href="http://googlepublicpolicy.blogspot.com/2010/03/newspaper-economics-online-and-offline.html"&gt;post about online and offline newspaper economics&lt;/a&gt; on the Google Public Policy blog.  Most of the ideas will be familiar if you read &lt;a href="http://www.shirky.com/"&gt;Clay Shirky&lt;/a&gt;: cross-subsidization of the news; specialized sites drawing away ad revenue; relative cost of production.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One point that I have been hearing less about was that online news consumption tends to be mostly from work while offline newspapers are read at home on leisure time.  In itself, this is not a huge insight; all of my news clients know that they get most of their traffic during the workday.  What I had not thought about was that reading time at work is significantly more compressed than at home.  The article gives statistics of 70 seconds per day online vs. 25 minutes offline &amp;mdash; and advertisers pay for a premium for that longer attention span.  The article predicts some good news for newspaper publishers: tablets (like the iPad) and other mobile devices (like the Kindle) will increase the at home consumption of the news and lengthen time spent reading.  This should even out the disparity between online and offline advertising revenue.  I think the accuracy of this prediction will depend on a) whether advertising formats can effectively adapt to and leverage the strengths of mobile devices and b) the advertisers opinion of the value of online advertising changes.  As for the latter, advertisers seem to illogically value the immeasurable benefit of print advertising over the more measurable benefit of online advertising.  That is, they probably assume print advertising is more effective than it actually is because there are no statistics to limit the perceived value.  There are some great posts about how &lt;a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2008/02/online-advertising-undervalued.html"&gt;online advertising is undervalued.&lt;/a&gt;.  Until this attitude changes, it will be difficult &lt;a href"http://techcrunch.com/2010/03/06/andreessen-media-burn-boats/"&gt;for newspapers to burn their boats&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Enterprise 2.0</title>
    <content type='html'>Last week I was at the &lt;a href="http://www.enterprise2conf.com/"&gt;Enterprise 2.0 conference&lt;/a&gt; in Boston for a panel on &lt;a href="http://www.enterprise2conf.com/conference/conference-by-day.php#1182322800"&gt;Enterprise Search&lt;/a&gt; (if you missed it, there were some prolific bloggers there.  In particular , &lt;a href="http://www.michaelsampson.net/"&gt;Michael Sampson&lt;/a&gt;, who may have typed every word he heard, and my former colleague &lt;a href="http://www.openparenthesis.org/"&gt;John Eckman&lt;/a&gt;.  There were also video cameras at many of the sessions and I imagine that they will be posted &lt;a href="http://www.enterprise2conf.com/archive/videos/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). For our session, we planned a fairly interactive agenda with a bunch of screencasts and then a dialog among the panelists and the audience.  About 30 minutes into the 60 minute session, we realized that we could have had a whole track dedicated to this topic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like it or not, search is turning into &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; interface of web 2.0.  Search is the glue that ties together all those fun to use collaboration tools like wikis and blogs.  The simple search box brilliantly hides all the PhD-class, post-doctorate algorithms and complexity that makes sense of a chaotic Web 2.0 world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But search is also a crutch and an enabler for not taking the time to organize and manage content.  People who use GMail or Google Desktop don't use folders anymore.  They keep their content in one large vat of informational soup.  Usually searching turns up things that they forgot they had or wouldn't have thought to organize in that way. People find it much better than the deeply nested folder structures that are forgotten soon after creation.  If you drink the search Kool Aid, "unmanaged" content starts to look less like a smothering and chaotic avalanche of virtual paper, and more like this protoplasm of information that nourishes business processes throughout the organization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back in reality, many companies are finding less success with their enterprise search engines.  Business users wonder why Intranet search can't be as good as &lt;a href="http://www.google.com"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; on the web. The standard response is that Intranet search is harder than Internet search.  I say both are really hard but in different ways.  While Internet search is dealing with unimaginable volumes of data and traffic and continuous attempts to manipulate the results for personal gain, Intranet search suffers from stagnation and lame content.  That and the fact that an Intranet search engine has to negotiate more complex access control rules than an Internet search engine does.  Still, I think that if the Intranet had better content, Intranet search would be better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What do I mean by better content?  We can start by more linking.  Internet search engines benefit from blogs and social bookmarking which create a meritocracy of content.  Click through rates also help a search engine learn what is good.  Writing good descriptions of content can help drive click through rates and prevent users from having to backtrack after being misled (the search engine learns from that behavior as well).  That raises another (and maybe the most important) question: why would employees want to create good content on the Intranet?  I know why people like myself out there in the blogosphere try to write good content.  In addition to all the millions I am making on &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/adsense"&gt;Google AdSense&lt;/a&gt; (totally &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; by the way. Would it kill you to click on a link?), I get a lot of professional benefit from blogging.  I can put out ideas and have very knowledgeable people respond and help me refine them.  I connect with people who can use my expertise or have similar interests and challenges.  My blog is also a great archive to help me remember things that I have seen and what I thought about them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Writing on an internal corporate blog was far less rewarding.  Hardly anyone read my internal blog even after continuous attempts to promote it (as in when people sent company-all emails asking a question I would point them to a post that I wrote on the topic).  And this was at a company that was supposed to be ahead of the curve.  Using blogs and wikis as &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;the &lt;/span&gt;communication tool on project teams was more effective (because I was managing the team and I wrote the performance reviews).  I wrote a &lt;a href="http://contenthere.blogspot.com/2006/08/managing-projects-with-trac.html"&gt;post about how we used Trac.&lt;/a&gt;  It was very effective but what was missing from the equation was some way for people to categorize and promote really good content so they turned up in search results.  We could have installed a social bookmarking software like &lt;a href="http://scuttle.org/"&gt;Scuttle&lt;/a&gt; but, if you are like me, you would want to use something like &lt;a href="http://del.icio.us/"&gt;del.icio.us&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://digg.com/"&gt;digg&lt;/a&gt; for external links and the internal system for internal links.  That way, when you leave, you get to keep your bookmarks to pages that you still have access to.  Here is an interesting thought...  now that we have reached a point where people think of their computers (or PDAs) as an extension of their brain, is it reasonable to make them leave this data behind to be formatted when they leave? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I heard several times at the conference that knowledge management is 90% people and 10% technology but what I didn't see was how to get people to step up and deliver their 90%.  Most of the ideas that I heard were around making it &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;easier.&lt;/span&gt;  I think that the secret to Enterprise 2.0 is how to make collaboration and knowledge sharing &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;more personally rewarding&lt;/span&gt;.  That is where I think we can learn the most from Web 2.0 (more so than with the mechanics of blogs, wikis, and tagging).  People out on the web &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;want&lt;/span&gt; to publish and put in extra effort to get their contributions noticed.  Maybe companies should create their own internal information economies that reward employees for creating content that other people &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;want&lt;/span&gt; to read.   Maybe reward for hits or positive votes or links toward.  Maybe companies should come up with ways to reduce the risk of an employee sharing his private knowledge base?  If the company has a social bookmarking system, why not let users export their links into a format that can be &lt;a href="http://www.quickonlinetips.com/archives/2006/03/import-browser-bookmarks-favorites-into-delicious/"&gt;imported into del.icio.us&lt;/a&gt; when they leave?  Doing so would encourage people to share external links as well. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your employees are motivated,  they will overcome obstacles like poor usability.  They will find a way to address issues like ownership.  They will stop looking for excuses not to participate.   They will tap into their entrepreneurial creativity to improve the flow of information in your organization.</content>

    <title>Sig Alert</title>
    <content type='html'>Totally off-topic, but if you have ever listened to the radio in Southern California, you have undoubtedly heard mention of a "Sig-Alert" about some traffic accident.  In case you ever wondered what "Sig-Alert" stands for, this is what the &lt;a href="http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/paffairs/faq/faq18.htm"&gt;DOT&lt;/a&gt; has to say:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Sig-Alerts" are unique to Southern California. They came about in the 1940s when the L.A.P.D. got in the habit of alerting a local radio reporter, Loyd Sigmon, of bad car wrecks on city streets. These notifications became known as "Sig-Alerts." Later Mr. Sigmon developed an electronic device that authorities could use to alert the media of disasters. Caltrans latched on to the term "Sig-Alert" and it has come to be known as any traffic incident that will tie up two or more lanes of a freeway for two or more hours.</content>

    <title>The Internets</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I just glanced at my blog traffic stats and, on a lark, clicked on the "search engine wars" view to see that Google represented 97.81% of my search engine traffic. I knew it was going to be high but what surprised me is how much higher this is than the average (Google had a 56.96% percent share according to &lt;a href="http://marketshare.hitslink.com/report.aspx?qprid=1"&gt;Market Share.&lt;/a&gt; However, &lt;a href="http://awis.blogspot.com/2006/07/search-engine-market-share.html"&gt;Geoffrey Mack estimated Google's share at 85%&lt;/a&gt;). My snap judgement, draws me to two conclusions:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Google likes my blog more than the other search engines do.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;li&gt;My audience likes Google more than other search engines.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;These conclusions are not mutually exclusive and I think they both could be right. As for the first one, there a couple of reasons why Google could like my blog (and I am sure that it is not because they think I am smart. With all those Ph.D's, I am sure that they know better than that). I blog on Blogger - a Google product. In addition to being lazy and cheap, choosing Blogger was actually a calculated decision. I suspected that Google may favor (unintentionally of course) their own web properties. More importantly, however, I think that Google love's blogs. Their hub and spoke view of the web is very conducive to the blogosphere and their ridiculously powerful search indexes can handle the volume. Ad Sense is probably making them a ton of money off of blogs too (of course, they don't pass much on to me. Hey maybe &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; is the reason why Google's market cap is so much higher than &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net"&gt;Content Here's&lt;/a&gt;!). Other search technologies and businesses are optimized for more traditional media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I did a little test of searching about Facebook and Intranet: a topic that has captured the attention of the blogosphere (at least my little hamlet of it). On Google, the top 5 results were all blogs. On MSN, however, the top 5 results were a television station, a press release, and pages from the Facebook site. On Yahoo! 4 of the top 5 results were blogs. Maybe they use del.icio.us (the other social media phenomenon) to help their search. They would be crazy not to. So, Google loves social media. But I don't always want social media. Soon after my Facebook search, I needed to find a 1099 form to download and send to someone. On Google, I got a &lt;a href="http://www.wikipedia.org" title="Wikipedia"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; article and a bunch of other links &lt;i&gt;about&lt;/i&gt; 1099s but not the form. The top results on MSN were from the irs.gov site and got me pretty near the form that I needed to download. So Google appears to be more &lt;i&gt;about the thing&lt;/i&gt; while MSN tends do be more the thing itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for my audience loving Google, I think that is probably true too. I write a lot about open source, Firefox puts the Google search box right there in your face. Safari does too (and doesn't allow you change it) and open source geeks love their Macs. I also like to think that my blog appeals to a hipper (nerdy is hip right?) crowd and IE is for the older crowd who think that IE &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; the Internet (apologies to the 30% of my readers who I have just alienated. I promise that I will fix that IE display issue someday). Google is also a big advocate of open source so there is probably some affinity there too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, if you take these two conclusions (even a little bit) you might be open to another proposition: that the Internet may be dividing again. This time it is less about browser compatibility and more about content. You have the "popular web" that is all about "blogging" and "tagging" and "poking" and "pwning". And then you have the traditional web that is more along the lines of the formal broadcast model with a few "official trusted sources." So maybe George Bush knew what he was talking about after all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, no one wants to break up the web. Having one Internet is really nice and no one wants to give up their reach into the whole Internet. That is why Microsoft bought a chunk of Facebook and traditional media outlets are trying to push community. In the long run, the uniters (not the dividers) are going to win. But still, you need that self proclaimed elite faction trying to stake out a "cool web" to push the envelope on what you can do with Internet technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content>

    <title>An Unconventional Approach to Recruiting</title>
    <content type='html'>I have been spending enormous amounts of time filling this role for a &lt;a href="http://www.lionbridge.apply2jobs.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=mExternal.showJob&amp;amp;RID=7571"&gt;technical web project manager&lt;/a&gt;. Most of the candidates that I have interviewed are not web savvy enough. I couldn't see them adding more value than assigning tasks and updating status reports. To be effective in this role, the candidate needs to understand how web pages work, be able to problem solve, and help educate our customers on the nuances of maintaining effective websites. Most of all, the candidate needs to &lt;em&gt;love the web&lt;/em&gt;. I mean, really love it. In addition to all that, there are the standard PM responsibilities of keeping track of issues and workload management.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After sourcing candidates the traditional way, I decided to take an unconventional approach. Rather than make the job application process easy to increase number of applicants that can later be filtered (by me), I created an experiment to filter up front with this &lt;a href="http://liox-web-pm.appspot.com/"&gt;simple job application form&lt;/a&gt;. The form applies three filters:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;You need to have a presence on the web — some URL. It could be your blog or personal site, your Twitter profile, your LinkedIn profile, Google Plus, about.me, flavors.me, Facebook… This shows that you are interested in the web and are participating.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;You need to be curious. It is not immediately obvious how to submit the form. I know a lot of people will bail and prefer the conventional route of pumping out résumés and job applications. I want a problem solver who looks for a clever solution.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;You need to have web skills. The solution requires that you know your way around your browser's developer tools and can diagnose a web display issue.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Successful form submissions get sent directly to my work email. Anyone who meets those three criteria deserves my careful consideration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I have floated this idea by a few colleagues. Some people love it. Some are skeptical. I have no idea how it is going to turn out and that makes it a perfect experiment. The only challenge is to publicize this as much as possible so I can have a statistical sample. If you are curious about this approach too, please share this blog post and the application link: &lt;a href="http://liox-web-pm.appspot.com/"&gt;http://liox-web-pm.appspot.com/&lt;/a&gt;. I promise to share the results even if they stink.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you are interested in the &lt;a&gt;job&lt;/a&gt;, good luck with the application!</content>

    <title>My Washington Gilbane Slides</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://contenthere.net/presentations/when_open_source_June_Gilbane.ppt"&gt;Here are the slides&lt;/a&gt; from my presentation at the &lt;a href="http://lighthouseseminars.com/washingtondc/"&gt;Washington Gilbane Conference on Content Technologies&lt;/a&gt;.  This was the first time Gilbane held a conference in DC and it was the first one to have an industry (in this case Federal Government) focus.  I was only able to stay one day but the sessions I attended were good.  The crowd was a little small but they seemed pretty engaged.  I wouldn't be surprised if this turns into an annual event.</content>

    <content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://ftp.osuosl.org/pub/drupal/files/videocasts/5-tour.mov"&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is Robert Safuto's (&lt;a href="http://www.awakenedvoice.com/"&gt;Awakened Voice&lt;/a&gt;) Drupal screencast showing Drupal 5.   This screencast is longer and starts at a more basic level than Jeff Robbins Drupal &lt;a href="http://ftp.osuosl.org/pub/drupal/files/videocasts/5-whats-new.mp4"&gt;screencast&lt;/a&gt; which mainly highlights what is new in Version 5.

    <title>Social Business: Revolution or Differentiator?</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Thank you &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/#!/deb_lavoy"&gt;Deb Lavoy&lt;/a&gt; for writing that Social Business blog that I have been meaning to write (&lt;a href="http://www.cmswire.com/cms/social-business/social-business-doesnt-mean-what-you-think-it-does-neither-does-enterprise-20-012620.php"&gt;Social Business Doesn't Mean What You Think It Does, Neither Does Enterprise 2.0&lt;/a&gt;).  Procrastination pays!  Deb did a better job than I could have done explaining that social business goes deeper than what we call "culture" as defined by the "corporate values" poster that you would see in a lunch area.  You need to go below this &lt;em&gt;surface culture&lt;/em&gt; right down to core attitudes about people and business.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anything social is about people and their connections. To be authentic in social business, your business has revolve around people.  You can't fake it.  You can't talk about people as "resources" and then turn around expect them to feel like they are members of a community.  Treat someone like a resource and he will behave like a resource.  He will not invest his personal identity to advocate for an organization.  He will save his personality and creativity for whatever community treats him like a person.  That may include friendships he has formed at work but not to the organization itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The difference between my imaginary article and Deb's real one is a slight change in emphasis.  I don't think Social Business will transform all companies. I don't think it is possible to run every business like a social business (although I would like to see every business try).  The companies that don't go social will not necessarily just shrivel up and die.  However, if one of their direct competitors makes the leap they will be operating at a distinct disadvantage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any business that has wide  disparity in pay and privilege will have a hard time becoming a social business. People at the top who prosper from the exploitation of the bottom become a faces of the company that are easy to resent.  Aggressive management that drives performance through reward/fear (the "coffee is for closers" culture) is an obstacle to social business; so are rigid roles and repetitive tasks that stifle individual expression. Anything that makes employees grumble to their peers after work will inhibit social business success.  What people say over beers is what they will want say if you try to make them social.  If you are frustrated by their silence. Consider that they are just being polite: "if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say it."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does every business need these anti-social practices?  I don't know; but the ones that do have them think they need them.  Remember the testimonies defending executive pay during the financial crisis hearings?  As managers, haven't we all experienced passing down pressure received from above?  Anti-social business behavior is always justified by a need to be competitive and survive.  If the customers only care about price (and not service, innovation, and connection) and the owners only care about growth and profits (like investors and shareholders do), the necessity of anti-social business behavior might be difficult to argue with.  But if the company operates in an industry that values the human element of business (as in what humans can offer: ideas, problem solving, listening, trust, relationships, etc.), long-range competitiveness may depend on the ability to transform into a social business.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>CMS Comparisons</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I just saw a post on the CM Pros mailing list describing a project to compare CMS using a markup language called &lt;a href="http://www.blogger.com/app/www.cmsml.org"&gt;CMSML&lt;/a&gt; which is like &lt;a href="http://usefulinc.com/doap"&gt;Description of a Project&lt;/a&gt; for CMS with special emphasis on the features that CMS should have. For those of you that are enrolled in the &lt;a href="http://www.cmprofessionals.org/events/summit.html"&gt;CM Professionals Summit&lt;/a&gt;, you can see a presentation by Bob Doyle and Erik Hartman including a demo of a site that includes ratings for 93 CMS systems (how about that for a teaser!).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tool uses a star-based scoring system for the categories Editing, Content Management, Document Management, Information Retrieval, and Records Management. Each of these categories has from 10 to 30 criteria that sum up to an overall score. The categories sound a little like "uses" similar to the approach that I advocated in an earlier &lt;a href="http://contenthere.blogspot.com/2004/11/open-source-cms-categorization.html"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;.  For example, looking for a Document Management System vs. a Content Management System.  I could see this information being used to get to a short list of products that excel in a few key areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>The Drupal Divide</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Recently there has been a lot of chatter about friction between the designers and developers within the &lt;a href="http://drupal.org"&gt;Drupal&lt;/a&gt; community (see posts by &lt;a href="http://www.angrydonuts.com/an-observation-about-designers-versus-developers"&gt;Earl Miles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.drupaler.co.uk/blog/author-sees-long-drupal-slope/437"&gt;Greg Harvey&lt;/a&gt;).  The Drupal community is huge and dynamic and is bound to have various skirmishes as members with different backgrounds and needs try to get what they want out of the platform.  But I didn't really expect that the divide would be along the lines of developers and designers.  I thought it would be between high-end adopters (like media companies) and low-end adopters (like individuals, small companies, and non-profits that make up the bulk of the Drupal community).  Or it could have been between people who see Drupal as a business application and those who see it as a development framework.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Drupal community is keenly aware of the importance of usability and has done a lot of work to identify issues.  With the upcoming version 7 release (code freeze any day now), Drupal upped their usability efforts by bringing in some high profile designers to participate.  The transition from being developer-dominated to having a more even balance between design and development is important for the Drupal platform as a business application.  &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2009/03/drupal-7-ui-be-part-of-the-solution.html"&gt;Mark Boulton and Leisa Reichelt conducted a very open process to incorporate peoples design ideas and feedback.&lt;/a&gt;  Now that I think of it, this rift between new ideas and the old Drupal guard was pretty inevitable.  This kind of transition is not easy.  Both sides need to adapt.  I don't think there will ever be total harmony between pure developers and pure designers but I do think the project can achieve a healthy level of tension that improves the software.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>WCM 2.0</title>
    <content type='html'>At the risk of adding to the confusion and hype, Brice Dunwoodie (&lt;a href="http://www.cmswire.com"&gt;CMSWire&lt;/a&gt;) and I just released the first of a 3 part series on Web 2.0 and content management.  In &lt;a href="http://www.cmswire.com/tgo/?id=001187"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;, we define Web 2.0 in practical terms that can be applied to web content management.  Our next two articles will focus on functionality that will be critical for Web 2.0 "compliance" and the adjustments that WCM customers and vendors will need to make to stay current.  I consider Brice and myself to be reasonable and realistic people.  We tend not to get swept up in the hype.  Yet both of use are seeing profound changes on the web.  Not keeping up with these developments will probably not translate into ruin for your business, but may lead to to some missed opportunities.  Brice and I are looking forward to getting your feedback.</content>

    <title>Nuxeo 5 EP Released</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://www.nuxeo.org/"&gt;Nuxeo&lt;/a&gt; just &lt;a href="http://www.nuxeo.org/sections/news/release-nuxeo-ep-5-0-0/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; the GA release of version 5 of their Enterprise Content Management offering &lt;a href="http://www.nuxeo.org/sections/projects/ep/"&gt;Nuxeo 5 EP&lt;/a&gt;.  This is the version that replaces the &lt;a href="http://zope.org/"&gt;Zope&lt;/a&gt;-based CPS product (which broke ground for open source in Enterprise Content Management) with an all Java implementation.  I have to say that I had my doubts on this migration and I am looking forward to checking out the new software.  I really liked the technical design philosophy that went into the CPS product and am hoping that they are successful translating those ideas onto a new platform.  The second test of this decision to move will be how their customer base will respond.  I subscribe to the CPS list and see that people are still actively using and extending the CPS product.  Will these customers move, stay or defect?  Will the move be smooth?  Will new customers who had been put off by Zope be suddenly be attracted to the new product?  It is going to be interesting watching this play out.</content>

    <content type='html'>Thanks for the comment Deane.  You did get me thinking...  If I remember correctly, the Hippo CMS 7 content type definitions are stored in the repository (rather than the file system).  This can pose a problem when it comes to configuration management.  I have been working on development standards (configuration management, continuous integration, automation) with a client whose CMS stores presentation templates, content type definitions, and other configuration in a JCR.  Configuration management for this kind of stuff was much harder than other applications we were working on.  Developers needed a mechanism to work on local (source controlled) files and push them to their development environment.  Automated scripts pushed those files to various server environments.  CMS that do everything in the UI and store configurations in the repository usually need some kind of import/export mechanism.</content>

    <title>Alfresco/OpenCms Integration</title>
    <content type='html'>There was a recent announcement on the &lt;a href="http://www.opencms.org/"&gt;OpenCms&lt;/a&gt; mailing list about a new &lt;a href="http://www.alfresco.com/"&gt;Alfresco&lt;/a&gt; add-on that  allows you to publish content from Alfresco into  an instance of OpenCms.  The project is called &lt;a href="http://alfresco-ocms.sourceforge.net/index.php?s=inicio&amp;l=en"&gt;Alfresco-OpenCms&lt;/a&gt;.  You can get the documentation &lt;a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=199461&amp;amp;package_id=237027"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  I haven't tried it out yet but the documentation shows examples in a normal Alfresco "Space" rather than a "Web Project." Web Projects are still relatively new and do not yet have all the capabilities that normal Spaces do so I am not sure that the module would work for a Web Project.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps the key value to this component is that it allows you manage content within Alfresco's sophisticated repository and leverage OpenCms's more mature web content delivery functionality.   For example, maybe you use Alfresco for internal collaboration and document sharing and then you publish some assets to your OpenCms powered corporate web site.</content>

    <title>Small Deployments</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Last week, when we released a new version of &lt;a href="https://www.liondemand.com"&gt;Lionbridge onDemand&lt;/a&gt;, I was reminded of a valuable lesson: keep your deployments small.  Up to that point, we had been upgrading the production environment on a regular basis &amp;mdash; nearly daily.  When a new feature was ready, we deployed it.  But this development iteration had some systemic improvements (new service types, enterprise features…) so we held off to release everything at once.  That was a mistake.  The problem was that lots of configuration changes had been building up (new settings, new libraries on the server, etc.) and that led to a lot more work at launch time.  As you would expect, some steps were missed that compromised functionality. It wasn't a huge deal. Nothing was obviously broken. There were just some "Oh SNAP!" moments along the way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to that reminder, we are back on schedule with regular code deployments. Some of the updates will be "under the waterline" &amp;mdash; invisible changes to the underlying architecture to support visitor facing features that we are still working on.  The trick is to keep the back-log of un-deployed code to a minimum.  In addition to reducing the risk of the actual deployment, smaller upgrades make it easier to troubleshoot issues because there are fewer potential causes.  For further reading on this topic read Eric Reis's chapter on Continuous Deployment in &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0043M4Z34/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0043M4Z34&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=contenthere-20"&gt;Web Operations: Keeping the Data On Time&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=contenthere-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B0043M4Z34" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /&gt;.  David Hobbs also has some great articles on this topic in relation to website launches.  The one that springs to mind is &lt;a href="http://hobbsontech.com/content/site-launches-do-little-possible"&gt;Site Launches: do as little as possible&lt;/a&gt;.  Also, to work in this way, it is also critical that you use a mature code management strategy.  A couple of months ago my team adopted the &lt;a href="http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/"&gt;Git Flow branching strategy&lt;/a&gt; and it has been a huge help.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People getting used to this model of product management will find it counter-intuitive. They see upgrades as risky, scary things and the natural tendency is to avoid them.  But the more you delay an upgrade, the scarier and riskier it gets.  And that creates a vicious circle.  Even if you know and agree with the small deployment approach, it is easy to justify delaying an upgrade because you want to do one more thing.  That is what happened to me. &lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Nice article benchmarking Joomla! and Drupal</title>
    <content type='html'>I just saw this &lt;a href="http://buytaert.net/drupal-vs-joomla-performance"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; by Dries, who is one of the lead programmers on the Drupal project.  The article compares the performance of &lt;a href="http://drupal.org"&gt;Drupal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.joomla.org"&gt;Joomla!&lt;/a&gt;.  The tests look pretty fair. The interesting finding is that, while Joomla! generates pages faster, Drupal's caching system is more efficient.  Joomla!s performance boost from caching seems really modest. Perhaps Dries knows more about Drupal caching than Joomla!  That would be understandable.  For both of these applications, the caching mechanism is not used for logged in users.   Both projects are adding framework layers and making the code more object oriented.  These layers of abstraction make the code more maintainable but make the application do more work in executing code.  Both give you choices of developing PHP based templates or using a rendering engine with non-PHP based tagging syntax.  Still, the benchmarks look pretty good.  I am sure they would be even better with a PHP accelerator. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a similar topic, I was at a meeting of the Boston Chapter of &lt;a href="http://www.cmprofessionals.org"&gt;CM Professionals&lt;/a&gt; and one of the attendees brought up the fact that most commercial software EULAs and certain Federal laws forbid customers from publishing reviews or benchmarks of their software.  Man, I would get into trouble if I wrote about commercial software.  If anyone knows more information about this, please post comments or send me an email.</content>

    <title>CMS Consolidation</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://www.grahamoakes.co.uk/"&gt;Graham Oakes&lt;/a&gt; has a great article about &lt;a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/68fa17f2-15d6-11dc-a7ce-000b5df10621.html"&gt;CMS consolidation&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="http://www.ft.com"&gt;Financial Times&lt;/a&gt;.  Companies could have saved a lot of money had they read Graham's article 5 years ago when centralized ECM was on everyone's list of initiatives.  One of my favorite points from the article:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is this really a process rationalisation project? Of course, there is often no real reason for the different processes. They just grew that way. In this case, rationalising processes makes a lot of sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, many organisations try to use technical consolidation to force business process rationalisation. This is a risky strategy. Change management is hard enough at the best of times. When management attention is focused on technology, it is hard to engage the right players and easy to overlook key factors. If process rationalisation is the real issue, it is best to face it head on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes technology projects are just excuses to address more systemic issues.  That or getting some sexy new technology is used as a bribe for getting people to change the way they do things.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Graham also makes the point that consolidation frequently has the side effect of making the whole organization move at the pace of the smallest business group.  I would go further and say that having every division on the same CMS slows the pace of innovation and enhancement to a pace that is &lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;slower&lt;/span&gt; than the slowest business group.  A single system that serves everyone has so many dependencies (both functional and political) that it is nearly impossible to get anything done.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the market has largely accepted that having one CMS to manage everything is a pipe dream.  I think that Graham makes the points especially eloquently.  So if you need to talk someone out of a major consolidation strategy, please use Graham's arguments.  Then try to achieve the same goals with targeted tools, better integration and improved processes.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hat tip to the &lt;a href="http://cmprosbenelux.org/"&gt;CM Pros Benelux&lt;/a&gt; for pointing the article out.</content>

    <content type='html'>I am doing a joint presentation in Toronto with Julian Mills from &lt;a href="http://www.prescientdigital.com"&gt;Prescient Digital&lt;/a&gt;.  As the agenda says, seating is extremely limited.  Here is the agenda:  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to fix a broken Intranet&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;October 11, 2006 Toronto, Ontario&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Prescient Digital Media, 180 Bloor Street West Suite 1102&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organizations build an intranet to facilitate communication, encourage collaboration, and streamline processes. Unfortunately, too many of these internal sites have failed to achieve their business objectives and now require fixing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social software â€” notably blogs, wikis and social bookmarking â€” offer powerful solutions for fixing a broken intranet. And open source content management solutions provide an ideal platform for supporting these applications, because they enable organizations to afford experimentation and reduce the innovation cycle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 90 minute information packed session offered Free at 8:30 a.m. and 3:30 a.m. in Toronto, presented by Julian Mills, of &lt;a href="/"&gt;Prescient Digital Media&lt;/a&gt;, and Seth Gottlieb, of &lt;a href="http://www.optaros.com/"&gt;Optaros&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seating is limited â€“ &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a title="" href="/News_Events/Upcoming_Events/_How_to_Fix_a_Broken_Intranet_.htm" a="" to="" how="" fix="" broken="" intranet??=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;register&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; today! &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a title="" href="/News_Events/Upcoming_Events/_How_to_Fix_a_Broken_Intranet_.htm" a="" to="" how="" fix="" broken="" intranet??=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Register&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; before September 27 and be entered to win a USB watch.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Agenda:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 13.6pt"&gt;8:30/3:30: Welcome and introduction&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 13.6pt"&gt;8:45/3:45: Strategies and case studies for fixing and intranet and implementing social software: Prescient Digital Media&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 13.6pt"&gt;9:15/4:15: Implementing social software with open source CMS: Optaros&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 13.6pt"&gt;9:45/4:45: Q &amp;amp; A&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>New Job: VP of Research Products at Aberdeen</title>
    <content type='html'>I am excited to announce that I am now working at &lt;a href="http://www.aberdeen.com/"&gt;Aberdeen&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;where I am the Vice President of Research Products. This is a big time at Aberdeen because we are shifting from a traditional analyst firm to what we are calling a "Market Intelligence" company. What that means is that our analysis is based on quantitative data rather than anecdote and opinion.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In particular, we are focusing on three categories of performance indicators:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Awareness&lt;/b&gt; quantified through surveys that ask respondents whether they are familiar with a product or brand.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Consideration&lt;/b&gt;, which is based on &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intent_marketing#Intent_Data_Sources"&gt;intent data&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Market Share&lt;/b&gt;, which is based on install data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
You can read more about the methodology on our &lt;a href="https://ww.aberdeen.com/solutions/"&gt;solutions page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
In this role I have gone deep into data science and also tapped into my own nerdy creativity and curiosity. If you like &lt;a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/"&gt;FiveThirtyEight&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://freakonomics.com/"&gt;Freakononics&lt;/a&gt;, you would love my job. &amp;nbsp;It's especially great for me because it allows me to leverage many skills I have developed over the years as an industry analyst, software developer, and database administrator.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
Lately I have been exploring historical install data to analyze events where one web content management system replaces another. For example, when a company replaces a website running on WordPress with a new website running on Sitecore. Re-platforming events such as these are significant because they represent customer requirements, product strengths (at least strengths perceived during the selection process), and big investments of time and money. And then when you combine that with intent data that shows which customers are showing signs of looking for a replacement technology, you get highly actionable insight.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
These data will be incorporated as features in our subscription products but I do plan to post tidbits on the Aberdeen blog. So stay tuned!&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>David Nuescheler nominated for award for JSR 283</title>
    <content type='html'>David Neuscheler, CTO of &lt;a href="http://www.day.com/"&gt;Day Software&lt;/a&gt;, was just nominated by the &lt;a href="http://jcp.org/en/home/index"&gt;JCP&lt;/a&gt; for the Most Outstanding Spec Lead Award for his work on &lt;a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=283"&gt;JSR 283&lt;/a&gt;.  JSR 283 takes the Java Content Repository (&lt;a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=283"&gt;JSR 170&lt;/a&gt;) further by adding enhancements like federation, remoting, more standard node types, and better access control.  JSR 283 was  first introduced in October 2005 and these things typically take a long time to make their way through.  In the first go around with JSR 170, the team kept momentum by building an open source reference implementation: &lt;a href="http://jackrabbit.apache.org/"&gt;Apache JackRabbit&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;a href="http://jazoon.com/en/conference/presentationdetails.html?type=sid&amp;detail=862"&gt;According&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="http://jazoon.com/en/conference/speakerdetails.html?type=author&amp;amp;detail=Jukka_Zitting"&gt;Zukka Zitting&lt;/a&gt;, JackRabbit (or at least a branch of it) will be used as a reference implementation for JCR 283.</content>

    <title>Gilbane 2012 Slides Posted</title>
    <content type='html'>Last week I presented a session about &lt;a title="Marketing Technology and Operations at Gilbane Boston 2012" href="http://gilbaneboston.com/12/conference_program.html#t4"&gt;Marketing Operations&lt;/a&gt; at the Gilbane Conference. The big idea is that marketing technologies are like bicycles.  If you commit the effort, the right technologies will help you get far.  But you can't just buy the equipment and expect success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[slideshare id=15524408&amp;amp;doc=gilbane20122-121206155136-phpapp02]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For more information, you can read two whitepapers that I wrote (with &lt;a href="http://www.ahamediagroup.com/"&gt;Ahava Leibtag&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ahaval"&gt;@ahaval&lt;/a&gt;): &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2012/10/building-a-marketing-operations-program.html"&gt;Building a Marketing Operations Program&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2012/09/operationalizing-your-content-marketing.html"&gt;Operationalizing your Content Marketing&lt;/a&gt;.</content>

    <content type='html'>&lt;div class="thumbnail"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skitch.com/sggottlieb/xbc6/re-virtually-there-itinerary-in-date-order"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.skitch.com/20080707-grru67cxnwiyufur27c3fj8ptj.preview.jpg" alt="Re: Virtually There - Itinerary - In Date Order" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Lucida Grande, Trebuchet, sans-serif, Helvetica, Arial; font-size: 10px; color: #808080"&gt;Uploaded with &lt;a href="http://plasq.com/"&gt;plasq&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="http://skitch.com"&gt;Skitch&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been playing around with services that help me keep track of where I am going and where I have been.  So far, the standout application for me has been &lt;a href="http://www.tripit.com/"&gt;Tripit&lt;/a&gt;.  You mainly use Tripit by forwarding the email confirmations that you get from various travel booking services that you use.  Tripit parses through the confirmation email and identifies where you are going and when.  It also is smart enough to put together several reservations as part of the same trip.  For example, if I book a hotel for the January 10th and 11th and a train ticket that leaves on the 10th and returns on the 12th, Tripit knows that it is part of the same trip.  I found the email parsing capabilities to be surprisingly accurate.  I occasionally try to stump Tripit by forwarding emails from international travel or very small hotels.  It almost always got it right.  Recently, when using a client's corporate travel service, I noticed an option to add my itineraries directly to Tripit (see screenshot).  I wouldn't be surprised if other travel services started to giving their customers this option.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tripit provides a lot of upside for the minimal effort it takes to forward an email.  For one, I get a nice little itinerary that I can print out. The itinerary has the address, confirmation codes, and telephone numbers of all the places that I need to be.  It even has maps.  I can also subscribe to an iCal calendar of my trips so everything is put right into my local calendar (I use iCal) along with my meetings.  This helps prevent me from scheduling meetings when I am en route.  My wife also subscribes to my calendar so she has all the details in her personal calendar as well.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other service that I think I will start to use is &lt;a href="http://brightkite.com"&gt;brightkite&lt;/a&gt;.  I will use this to post when I am at a particular place and I want to meet up with a friend.  I like the features of brightkite.  You can easily "check in" to a location either by address or by using a saved place (called a "marker").  Brightkite suppors a simple syntax that you can use over SMS.  Plus you can &lt;a href="http://ping.fm"&gt;Ping.fm&lt;/a&gt; to email in your location.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also tried &lt;a href="http://www.dopplr.com"&gt;Dopplr&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://fireeagle.yahoo.net"&gt;Fire Eagle&lt;/a&gt;.  Dopplr didn't do it for me at all.  You have to manually enter your trips.  I tried to have Dopplr listen to my Tripit calendar but it was horrendously inaccurate.  Dopplr had me taking all these crazy trips to various parts of the world and treated lay-overs at different airports as discrete trips.  It wouldn't be so bad if Dopplr was not counting my carbon emissions.  I hated feeling defensive about all those trips I was not event taking.  I closed my Dopplr account.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am on the fence about Fire Eagle.  I should feel very lucky that I have an account there.  I hear that invites are very hard to get.  But I don't feel like I get much value from the service.  Fire Eagle can listen to other services to find out where I am.  I have it listening to brightkite.  There are a number of other applications which I don't use (like Dopplr, Plazes, and Navizon) that also talk to Fire Eagle.  The only benefit that I see is that it gives &lt;a href="http://www.yahoo.com"&gt;Yahoo&lt;/a&gt; more information to serve me up better ads (which really isn't a benefit for me) and search results (but I use Google search). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, for now, I am sticking with Tripit and brightkite.</content>

    <title>CM Professionals Summit</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cmprofessionals.org"&gt;CM Professionals&lt;/a&gt; is holding its &lt;a href="http://www.cmprofessionals.org/events/summit.html"&gt;second Summit&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://www.cmswire.com/cms/industry-news/cm-professionals-announces-second-semiannual-member-summit-000531.php"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;) in San Francisco on April 11th, 2005.  I went to the first Summit in Boston (November, 2004) and it was a great opportunity to meet others who live and breathe content management, share our experiences and think together about solving content management problems.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like the Boston Summit, the Spring Summit is being held in conjunction with the &lt;a href="http://www.gilbane.com/conferences/San_Francisco_05.html"&gt;The Gilbane Conference on Content Management Technologies&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://contenthere.blogspot.com/2004/12/keynote-themes-from-gilbane.html"&gt;my notes from the Boston Gilbane Conference&lt;/a&gt;) and Summit attendees receive a discount on their conference registration fees.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See you there!&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Outerthought Joins NGDATA</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I just received an email update that &lt;a href="http://www.ngdata.com/"&gt;NGDATA&lt;/a&gt; has bought &lt;a href="http://outerthought.org/site/index.html#"&gt;Outerthought&lt;/a&gt;, developers of &lt;a href="http://outerthought.org/site/products/lily.html"&gt;Lily CMS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.kauriproject.org/kauri/index.html"&gt;Kauri web application framework&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://outerthought.org/site/products/daisy.html"&gt;Daisy CMS&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;a href="http://www.ngdata.com/site/news/96-ng.html"&gt;Here is the announcement&lt;/a&gt;.  I do not know much about NGDATA other than it is a bigger company with a focus on big data.  But just from that information, the acquisition could be a great opportunity for both sides.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have been following Outerthought for a long time (starting in 2007 when I wrote about them in &lt;a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/77090148/Open-Source-Web-Content-Management-in-Java"&gt;Open Source Content Management in Java&lt;/a&gt;) and got to know the team when I presented at one of their &lt;a href="http://outerthought.org/site/news/events/oscmsfschat.html"&gt;Fireside Conversations&lt;/a&gt;.  The Outerthought team has always impressed me with their architectural vision and ambition.  One day, I sat down with their architects and developers and was blown away by their insight and creativity.  At times I was doubtful that a team so small (with so little external funding) could execute on such lofty plans: developing a new web application framework and building the first "big data" CMS.   But they seem to continually defy my doubts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I hope that NGDATA fully understands what it got out of this deal and gives the Outerthought team autonomy and resources to continue its successful track record and further accelerate the pace.  Most of all, I wish the Outerthought team a great future as part of NGDATA.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type='html'>Hi Roland,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks for the comment!&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;While eZ Publish is not technically &amp;quot;page oriented&amp;quot; (there is rich support for content classes), the platform definitely has a hierarchical structure.  Part of the publishing process places the content object on the site tree.  If you want &amp;quot;placeless content,&amp;quot; you need to do things like put items in a hidden folder and reference them from your templates.  Not that there is anything wrong with that. I think this is the best model for most websites because it is concrete and intuitive to most users.  eZ Publish also nicely allows content items to have multiple locations.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is very different from platforms like Wordpress and Drupal, which have content sitting in a flat structure and use facets like categories and date ranges to group them and menus to create navigational elements.</content>

    <title>Apache Lenya 2.0 Released</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;After over 3 years since its last major release, the Apache Lenya team &lt;a href="http://www.apachenews.org/archives/001098.html"&gt;just announced the official release of version 2.0&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="http://koerperarbeit-zeche-ludwig.de/index_en.html"&gt;There is one known live site running 2.0&lt;/a&gt; that was built off of the unreleased 2.0 trunk by one of the committers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;2.0 was originally slated to be called 1.4 but the release got so big that they renamed it to 2.0 (I talked about it &lt;a href="http://contenthere.blogspot.com/2007/06/tale-of-two-releases.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). Even though this is a major release that took a lot of work, most of the big changes are under the covers and are not visible to the content contributor. Hopefully these architectural improvements, plus fresh blood on the development team ( a few new committers have recently been voted in), will be a launching point for further progress on the project.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content>

    <title>Things now at 1.0 (plus a discount)</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;div class="thumbnail"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skitch.com/sggottlieb/bycqx/things"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.skitch.com/20090107-mqaxqawd5wtc2m1kifdc1gyyfa.preview.jpg" alt="Things" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Lucida Grande, Trebuchet, sans-serif, Helvetica, Arial; font-size: 10px; color: #808080"&gt;Uploaded with &lt;a href="http://plasq.com/"&gt;plasq&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="http://skitch.com"&gt;Skitch&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of my favorite personal software applications is &lt;a href="http://culturedcode.com/things/"&gt;Things by Cultured Code&lt;/a&gt;.  I wrote about Things a while ago in &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2008/06/i-use-this.html"&gt;a long post of Mac applications that I like&lt;/a&gt;.  Since that time I have increased my usage of Things.  It is now everything from a to do list to a personal issue tracker for projects that I work alone on.  Being able to quickly jot down a task saves you from breaking the flow of what you are currently working on.  The iPhone application is there to receive tasks when I am not near a computer.  The two applications synchronize whenever they see each other on a WiFi network.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Cultured Code Team has just released version 1.0 of Things.  The beta releases have been free but now it costs $50 ($49.95 to be precise). If you are also hooked on Things, you can use the coupon code "THINGSPRESALE20" to get 20% off the list price.</content>

    <title>Managing Metadata</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I just read &lt;a href="http://www.betaversion.org/~stefano/linotype/news/95/"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="http://www.betaversion.org/~stefano/"&gt;Stefano Mazzocchi&lt;/a&gt; that discusses the difficulty of merging metadata.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing we figured out a while ago is that merging two (or more) datasets with high quality metadata results in a new dataset with much lower quality metadata. The "measure" of this quality is just subjective and perceptual, but it's a constant thing: everytime we showed this to people that cared about the data more than the software we were writing, they could not understand why we were so excited about such a system, where clearly the data was so much poorer than what they were expecting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stefano speaks mainly from a Semantic Web perspective but his observations are very relevant to content management and aggregating content from multiple sources.  Right now the general business world is very far behind the community in which Stefano works (librarians, which you could say are metadata professionals).  Our users struggle to invest any time author good metadata.  But once we finally get them to truly focus on the metadata (or automate them out of the process), hopefully library science and the semantic web will have solved the issues and nuances of when you have good metadata and are ready to really use it.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Alfresco Closes $2 Million Seed Round Financing to Build an Enterprise
CMS</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.alfresco.org/"&gt;Alfresco&lt;/a&gt;, a start-up founded by John Newton (co-founder of Documentum) just got $2MM in seed round financing from Accel Partners.  They want to become the MySQL of Enterprise Content Management and promise an initial release of the product for download on July 27th 2005.  The web site is a little thin but some information can be found on the &lt;a href="http://www.alfresco.org/roadmap.html"&gt;road map page&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://www.alfresco.org/modernarchitecture.html"&gt;architecture page&lt;/a&gt;.  They have made a great selection of OSS components: Lucene search, Spring AOP framework, and JCR (Java Content Repository) support and the application will run on JBOSS. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is unclear if/how an external community will contribute to the project - that area of the site is not yet live.  However, none of the people listed on the team page have a history of open source project leadership so it is possible that development might be limited to Alfresco engineering staff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am looking forward to trying Alfresco. There are few major open source CMS projects focusing on document management despite the fact that document management represents a major part of the content management market.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Two New Plone Books</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Over the past couple of months, two new books have come out on Plone:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Definitive Guide to Plone by Andy McKay (a lead developer on the Plone team) available &lt;a href="http://his.biologie.hu-berlin.de/PloneBook/"&gt;online&lt;/a&gt; for free and onpaper from &lt;a href="http://www.apress.com/book/bookDisplay.html?bID=335"&gt;APress&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Plone Content Management Essentials by Julie Meloni available from &lt;a href="http://www.samspublishing.com/title/0672326876"&gt;SAMS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &lt;a href="http://books.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/12/21/0044235&amp;from=rss"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; on Slashdot is very thorough and interesting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plone is becoming a real market leader in content management software.  Consider that:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;"The UK's Ministry of Defence's Defence Academy says it chose Plone and Zope, an open source content management system and supporting application server, for the software's functionality, not its negligible cost." (&lt;a href="http://www.infoconomy.com/pages/strategy-column/group100524.adp"&gt;Infoconomy Article&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Two major newspaper sites (Boston Globe and the San Diego Union-Tribute) use Plone&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chief objection that I hear about Plone is Python and lack of in house skills.  I have a feeling that with books like this, this trend may change.  I wonder if Python and Zope could be the de-facto technologies for content management.  Given that Zope has been designed from the ground up as a content management focused application server and Python is an extremely effective and high performing programming language, I would not count the possibility out.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type='html'>Thanks for the comment Matt.  My understanding of the implementations that you mention is that Alfresco publishes to the file system or database of a de-coupled delivery tier.  Therefore, the Alfresco repository is not exposed to the intense load of the live site runtime.  This is especially true for implementations that use the AVM (Advanced Versioning Model repository that his built into the WCM) which is considerably slower than the standard Alfresco repository that is used by the rest of Alfresco.   If I am wrong on this, please let me know.  I am very interested in learning about how Alfresco is scaled in this way &amp;quot;out in the wild.&amp;quot;</content>

    <title>Area Architect Dreams of Model Architecture</title>
    <content type='html'>Most software architects are idealists at heart and think in terms of clean UML diagrams. In approaching a content management project, their tendency is to apply best practices in software development and design an architecture that supports highly structured and reusable content and separates concerns of management (authoring, workflow, and persistence) and delivery (formatting, personalization, and branding). The resulting picture is a "pluggable" architecture of components that can be swapped out as needed. As a software architect myself, I too am drawn to this model and, in many cases, it makes a lot of sense. However, most content management software applications try to play on both the management and delivery sides of the content management problem. If you want to achieve this de-coupled, pluggable architecture, you will most likely need to behead your CMS and put another delivery tier in front of it. Should you cut off the head to spite the face of your CMS? Maybe, but here are some things to think about.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Where a software architect's "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns"&gt;separation of concerns&lt;/a&gt;" is on functional lines, a business user's concerns are task oriented. A business user's task is to produce content. But they don't just write. They write, review, write, review, then submit. And these loops are not long workflow steps involving many people. They consist of tiny cycles of typing and previewing. Interestingly, this is how software programmers work nowadays. They code a little, then they test. It has been 20 years since programmers have been asked to write a whole program and then send it over the wall to see if it worked. Now we give programmers IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) so that they can write and review (test) in the same environment. Modern software development methodologies stress continuous testing &lt;i&gt;by the developers&lt;/i&gt; not just a separate group of quality assurance staff.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;End to end CMS, which own the management and delivery tier, perform the same service as a programmer's IDE. They create a sandbox for the content author to &lt;i&gt;develop the site&lt;/i&gt; (notice word choice here, I will talk about that later). When the delivery tier is decoupled from the management tier, this integrated environment must be custom built if it is to be provided. You need to be able to replicate the delivery sandbox and build publishing functionality to point to different delivery targets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The other area where the concerns of management and delivery are not so clearly separated is that most users want to use their CMS to control &lt;i&gt;how&lt;/i&gt; the content is displayed - a domain that should philosophically be owned by the delivery tier in that model architecture. This control is on two levels: at the content detail level (with layouts); and at the overall information architecture level - where the content will appear. Preview and control of the former is often easier to provide because it is simpler to push a single piece of content to a presentation template than to refresh the entire instance of the site (remember people like to preview every couple of minutes). Showing where a piece of content would appear in a search result list requires all the proposed content to be staged in the staging instance of the site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These requirements of being able to control the the composition and behavior of the site is what I was referring to earlier when I said "develop a site." Typical needs include explicitly determining the order of lists of content and what reusable assets appear where. When the content producer is a &lt;i&gt;site developer&lt;/i&gt;, the qualities that he must control and test do not end with the spelling, grammar, and accuracy of the text. He needs an environment that gives him a round trip preview experience of the whole site. He needs the IDE to develop the site not just a tool to produce content.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, in many cases, it may be reasonable to limit the scope of a content contributor to the composition of words and images. After all, your average Associated Press reporter is not able to control how his article will appear on the &lt;a href="http://www.gazettenet.com/"&gt;Daily Hampshire Gazette&lt;/a&gt;. If you are doing a lot of personalization, preview is also less valuable because there is no way an author can simulate all the different conditions that drive personalization rules. But this is not how your average corporate website works. Corporate websites are less query based and programmatic and more explicitly and manually composed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Systems that publish to different channels and have complex delivery logic (where preview is less useful) tend to make better candidates for decoupled architectures because of the investment that it takes to develop the delivery tier. These sites have lots of custom code (or configuration files) that has evolved over time and is extremely expensive to port. In fact, it is usually hard to even estimate the time to port these applications because no one really knows the rules and algorithms. The behavior is totally undocumented except for in the code itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So if you are designing your dream architecture with different pluggable tiers and your business users are hassling you about preview and control, you need to ask yourself "is my delivery tier sophisticated and complex enough to warrant having to build my own?" If it is, you need to be able to explain to the users that the delivery tier is a complex application that drives the presentation and their job is to fill the tank. You can give them a single page simulated preview and they can share a full staging instance of the site if they wanted to review the whole site before a mass publish. If they don't buy it, you can build in the additional integration to support "site developer" tasks or wait for the next project to design that precious architecture.</content>

    <title>My Enterprise Text Editor</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596519788?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=contenthere-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0596519788"&gt;The Productive Programmer (Theory in Practice (O'Reilly))&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=contenthere-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0596519788" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /&gt; is a useful book of how to use your computer more efficiently.  One of the several tips that I have adopted is to use one text editor (in my case, &lt;a href="http://macromates.com/"&gt;TextMate&lt;/a&gt;) for all text oriented work.  The idea behind this is that when you work in one tool, you get to know it really well and can take advantage of all its nifty time saving features.  Most software users, however, only use a tiny fraction of the useful features supported by the software.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had gradually been moving in this direction for a while.  At first, I just used a text editor to program in dynamic languages (Javascript, Python, PHP, Perl, SQL), do HTML/XML markup, and edit large data files.  About 6 months ago, I got so fed up with Eclipse's clunkiness that I started to write Java in TextMate.  Since reading the chapter in the book, though, I have started to use &lt;a href="http://blog.macromates.com/2006/blogging-from-textmate/"&gt;TextMate as a blogging tool&lt;/a&gt;.  This was a big step for me because I was quite happy with &lt;a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/"&gt;Red Sweater's MarsEdit software&lt;/a&gt;.  Yes I know that MarsEdit gives you the option to edit posts in TextMate but I decided to go all in.  I have not yet been able to get TextMate hooked up as my email editor.  I always thought programmers that did everything in EMACS were silly.  But since making the change, I have found a lot of powerful keyboard shortcuts and macros. My one hold-out is that I still use Oxygen for editing my DocBook documents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My successful experience caused me to question whether there was any merit to the "One CMS to rule them all" ECM (Enterprise Content Management) vision that I have been battling over the past 7 years (a battle that I won, by the way, but I am not gloating).  Would there be any benefit of having a knowledge worker getting to be a true expert in one tool?  Then I came to senses and realized two key differences:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Web Content Management is about managing semi-structured data, Enterprise Content Management is about managing metadata&lt;/strong&gt;.  A WCMS primarily helps a user edit and and assemble reusable, structured content. In a document-oriented ECM system, most of the documents are binary files that are edited using tools like MS Word. These ECM systems are used primarily for creating metadata, organizing, and managing permissions. Furthermore, most people organize their documents on a file system metaphor.  Web content organization tends to be much more fluid and rule based. Your website is not a file system.  You will fail at web content management if you think that a website is a bunch of MS Word documents saved as HTML.  Because there is so little functional overlap, one tool doesn't make sense.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CMS users don't define them selves as CMS users&lt;/strong&gt;. Programmers, at least the good ones, care about their craft and take pride in how they work. &lt;a href="http://www.pragprog.com/"&gt;They read books and blogs to continually hone their skills&lt;/a&gt;. They love their tools and treasure knowledge of obscure little tricks. Good designers tend to be the same way. Your average content contributor may be similarly inspired about their profession, but if they are, they don't usually consider using a computer program as part of that quest. For them the computer software is a necessary evil. They are looking for intuitive tools that require no learning.  They tend not to invest the time to achieve expertise. If I were to equate using a computer to driving a car, the average computer user drives around in 1st gear or reverse all day long.  They discover a way to get the car to move and then leave it at that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a direct relationship between specialization and intuitiveness of software.  When the software designer knows exactly what the user will use the software for, he can be very explicit in the user interface.  For example, when creating a blogging tool, the software designer can put in a big button that says "CREATE BLOG ENTRY."  A designer of a more generalized, multi-functional tool requires more compromise and negotiation with the user.  The user needs to learn how to access lots of basic capabilities and string them together to get the result that he wants. Just look at the UNIX command line and piping together commands.  TextMate is a little of both, the designer of TextMate knows that the user is going to want to enter text and save files.  That is why the program opens with a big area to type in. But the designer doesn't know whether the user will be wanting to post this block of text to a blog or compile the text into executable software or hundreds of other options.  This is why those functions need to be buried under cryptic key sequences like "control-command-p" (that's post to blog) or "command-r" (that is compile and run).  If a CMS was written for someone that wanted to be a CMS expert, it would probably look something like a &lt;a href="http://www.sabretravelnetwork.com/images/uploads/screenshots/MySabre_screenshot.JPG"&gt;command line Sabre terminal&lt;/a&gt;.  And this is why all purpose tools fail for content managers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>eZ publish Extension Supports OASIS OpenDocument Standard</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://ez.no"&gt;eZ systems&lt;/a&gt; just announced an &lt;a href="http://ez.no/community/contribs/import_export/oasis_open_document_extension"&gt;extension for  eZ publish&lt;/a&gt; that will support the &lt;a href="http://ez.no/community/contribs/import_export/oasis_open_document_extension"&gt;OASIS Open Document Standard&lt;/a&gt;.  The OpenDocument standard was approved in May 2005 and establishes an XML based format for office type applications (word processor, spreadsheet, etc.) that will increase the accessibility and re-usability of documents used within the enterprise.  Read more &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenDocument"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=office"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  OpenDocument is very close to the format developed by &lt;a href="http://www.openoffice.org"&gt;Open Office&lt;/a&gt; and, I think, is the missing link between the way we work today and our vision of a content managed world of re-usable, highly structured assets.  Of course, this all depends on Microsoft's cooperation on adopting this or some structured XML format (promised with the next release of Office).  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The eZ publish OpenDocument Extension accepts files in OpenDocument, Microsoft Word, and RTF and uses a WebDAV interface to upload documents via drag and drop.  From eZ publish, content can be automatically exported into the OpenDocument format using OpenOffice templates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have had a lot of conversations about Open Office recently.  The key issue is "what's the point."  My view is that OpenOffice could turn into the preferred authoring interface used by open source and proprietary content management systems.  This would put them at the level of Microsoft which is integrating Office with several of their server side technologies (like MCMS and SharePoint) to create a collaborative workspace using desktop applications.  Of course, Microsoft has a huge advantage in market share and you just can't sell a product without at least a claim of MS Office support these days.  But if enough CMS vendors start to support OpenOffice (and they have an interest in doing so because they compete with Microsoft on the CMS side), the office software market could get interesting again.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Jeffrey Veen on Making a Better CMS</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I just just read Jeffrey Veen's essay &lt;a href="http://www.adaptivepath.com/publications/essays/archives/000365.php"&gt;Making A Better CMS&lt;/a&gt; and was struck by his intentionally provocative claim: â€œMost open source content management software is useless. The only thing worse is every commercial CMS Iâ€™ve used.â€  In the essay, Veen admits that his sample is limited to the out of the box installs that he was able to try on &lt;a href="http://www.opensourcecms.com"&gt;OpenSourceCMS&lt;/a&gt; which, although he does not say, is limited to a few LAMP based community CMS products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I will refrain from my impulse to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisking"&gt;Fisk&lt;/a&gt; this article because I feel like people who make a living by complaining about software do have something to add to the dialog. I do have issue with calling a whole category of software â€œUselessâ€ because a couple applications do not meet his vision of how software should work.  CMS is a hard domain because these systems are used in such different ways by such different users.  There are constant trade offs between "ease of use" and complexity, "out of box" and flexibility. I can see why Jeffrey is frustrated by everything he has not written himself.  On the bright side,  with Open Source, we have the ability to change what we don't like. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are some valid points that Jeffrey raises:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;"Write task-based documentation first."&lt;/span&gt;  A couple of products do this really well.  For example, Plone's &lt;a href="http://plone.org/documentation/howto"&gt;How Tos&lt;/a&gt; are excellent.  However, some products have almost no documentation at all.  I think this is a great area where business users can contribute to the OSS movement.  We have all these excellent writers using content management systems.  Rather than complain, ask questions and write documentation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;"Why do you insist on Web sites that have 'columns'?" &lt;/span&gt; Layout and positioning with CSS is relatively new.  Most websites don't do it.  There are some incompatibility issues with older browsers.  Still, I think this technology makes leaner and easier to manage pages and newer software has a great opportunity to use it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;"Make it easy to install."&lt;/span&gt;  One of the great things about OSS is that it allows people to freely download and demo it (without even filling out a form and getting hassled by a salesperson).  Creating a simple and bullet proof install routine is critical to driving adoption.  Some products are better than others.  However, my experience with most commercial systems (CMS, and other server based software) is that they don't even try to be easy to install.  In fact, most big software vendors have installation engineers that go on-site and install the software for their paying customers (not for free either).  They rationalize this with the argument installing is a one-time thing and varies from environment to environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;"Users of a public Web site should never, never, be presented with a way to log into the CMS."&lt;/span&gt;  Good point, I see that Jeffrey can write his â€œown templates, and even dip into object-oriented Perl and Python.â€  He should be able to take care of that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</content>

    <title>Changes for Bricolage</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.betaversion.org/%7Estefano/linotype/"&gt;Stefano Mazzocchi&lt;/a&gt;, who has been called a "serial community builder" and has lead a few &lt;a href="http://www.apache.org/"&gt;ASF&lt;/a&gt; projects, once told me that the only true measure of the strength of a community is how it endures a change in leadership.  Well, the &lt;a href="http://www.bricolage.cc/"&gt;Bricolage&lt;/a&gt; community is about to find out how strong it is.  &lt;a href="http://www.justatheory.com/"&gt;David Wheeler&lt;/a&gt;  who, under his company  &lt;a href="http://www.kineticode.com/"&gt;Kineticode&lt;/a&gt;, has been the driving force behind the &lt;a href="http://www.kineticode.com/"&gt;Bricolage project&lt;/a&gt;, has taken a full time job with &lt;a href="http://www.raelity.org/"&gt;Values of n&lt;/a&gt;, to help build a new product called &lt;a href="http://stikkit.com/"&gt;Stikkit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an email posted on the Bricolage list, David pledged to stay engaged with the community and remain a committer on the project, but said he will not be able to devote as much time to developing and extending the platform himself.  He put out a call for others to actively contribute and step up into a leadership role.  While the Bricolage community has a critical mass, David's energy has really kept the project going.  He answers most of the questions on the list and takes ownership of most of the operations and enhanceme&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="return false;" tabindex="7"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;nt ideas.  In these cases, you never know whether having one really active member enables others to be more passive or whether that active member is just filling a vacuum.  It looks like we are about to find out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a number of companies that use Bricolage.  Each one has a clear motivation to keep the community energized.  It remains to be seen whether they will invest their time to do it.  I have been watching Bricolage for quite some time and I hope that we see a new leader grow out of this change.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Knowledge working open source style</title>
    <content type='html'>My career spans across the domains of a software developer and a knowledge worker. I participate in software development projects and I also do the things that your typical knowledge worker does: communicate information through reports, presentations, and other knowledge assets. One thing I have noticed from this perspective is that software development has been improving from the adoption of open source tools, behaviors, and practices while most knowledge workers live in the comparative stone ages of siloed working habits. As someone who loves living out in the country and working with people from around the world (and is also trying to reduce his carbon footprint), I look forward to the day when knowledge workers start to harness the techniques that distributed open source development teams have used to effectively produce quality software. Here are some places to start.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using &lt;em&gt;Mailing Lists&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;IRC&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;Mailing lists (and sometimes &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat"&gt;IRC&lt;/a&gt;) are the core channel of communication within open source development teams. Point to point emails (and, shudder, phone calls) are discouraged because they lead to duplicate communication and there is no centralized record of what was said. IRC is preferable to point to point instant messaging for the same reason. Frequently once there is a critical mass of substance on a topic, a wiki page (mentioned later) will be used to capture and organize the idea as it develops.Especially in the world of IRC, it is important to include some social value (i.e. fun) in the dialog. Otherwise, the people who have all the answers have little benefit in participating. I have worked on projects where everyone worked within arms reach of each other, listened to music on their headphones but constantly communicated over chat. I liked this way of working because if you had a complex thought in your head that would unravel if you were interrupted, you could ignore the conversation and catch up when you got to a good stopping place. I realized the secondary benefit much later: when the team was broken up and staffed on other projects, the conversation kept on going even though people were spread all over the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using &lt;em&gt;Wikis&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;Most open source projects use wikis for documentation. Wikis have a number of advantages over Office/Sharepoint: they stress information over formatting; they have excellent history and version comparison; they encourage referencing information (through links) over duplication (copy/paste); there is no local copy to synchronize; and they don't require special client-side tools to contribute. Every time I open a word processor, I challenge myself whether this needs to be a "document." My general rule of thumb is that I only do it for proposals, deliverables, and contracts where the audience needs their own local copy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Managing &lt;em&gt;Vision&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Tasks&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;Even though I have worked on several software projects that wound up going nowhere, I have to say that an even higher percentage of knowledge work is wasted. You could argue that the act of knowledge work leads to learning which creates knowledge. But running around in circles without any results is demoralizing. I like developing software systems because you see tangible results. I wish knowledge work was more results oriented. The better managed software projects maintain a road map which communicates an overall vision of what is going be achieved broken down into milestones. Gantt charts just don't capture the "why" like a road map does. I think knowledge work could benefit from the same understanding. People should be responsible for mapping their individual activities to a shared set of goals and priorities.Open source projects rely heavily on issue tracking systems to manage work. Bugs and enhancement ideas all go into the issue tracking system where they are prioritized and assigned. If you have an idea for a new feature, you create an issue, assign it to yourself and start working. Maybe someone else shares your interest and starts to collaborate with you. In distributed teams, where you can't see people working, you need other ways to keep track of what people are doing - not just if you are given the role of "project manager." An issue tracking system would be a good way to achieve this.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Holding &lt;em&gt;Sprints&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;Open source projects have long understood that effective collaboration depends on communication and trust, which are most efficiently achieved through face to face interaction. For this reason, many open source projects hold &lt;a href="http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/python/2006/10/19/running-a-sprint.html"&gt;sprints&lt;/a&gt; (also known as &lt;a title="Hackathon" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon"&gt;hackathons&lt;/a&gt;) where people work closely together (as in 2 to a computer) and mix hard work with an equal balance of socializing and play. In a typical office setting, people need to rush home at quitting time to attend to their home life. If they normally work from home and travel to a sprint, they are more likely to hang out after work and get to know their colleagues.I think the sprint technique could have huge potential in knowledge work. It would get people together to share information and it would create networks for people to use in solving future problems. One big thing about software sprints is that they are centered around solving a specific problem or accomplishing a goal. I think that knowledge workers would really respond well to this sense of purpose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Componentizing&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;Good developers know how to break down their software into re-usable components and reuse them. Most knowledge workers live by copy/paste (or Save As). Copy/paste not only creates redundancy that is hard to manage, it also frequently inserts unwanted content into your document. If you want to re-use something as it is, try to reference it. Granted, software has the advantage of build processes that assemble the appropriate parts to produce a cohesive product. Technical documentation (in XML) is often built like software. Most other stuff (particularly anything written in an Office (Microsoft or Open) is not.A while back I produced a coding standards document for my company. I based it on the Sun Microsystems' Java Coding Standards. Rather than copy the whole thing and then edit the parts I wanted to change, I referenced the original and created a small addendum document that discussed where we were deviating from Sun's standards. While this does not create a polished deliverable, it conveyed the necessary information which is what I was trying to do in the first place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Designating a &lt;em&gt;Committer&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;In large open source projects, lots of developers submit their code to a small team of committers who review everything before committing it to the source code repository. Knowledge workers are constantly creating assets and dumping them into places where they are often never read. Sometimes these assets are never reviewed but are randomly discovered. Then it is up to the reader to determine if the information is valid. Because of this, most companies are swimming in information of wide ranging quality and accuracy. Search technology vendors claim the answer is in sophisticated retrieval systems. I would argue that more attention to the review and categorization of information at the intake end is needed. The committer for knowledge work would be a subject matter expert with librarian skills. This committer would know about what has already been done, be able to judge quality, and see opportunities to create shared resources. In open source projects, the committer is a position of status earned by climbing up through a meritocracy. The analogous knowledge worker position in most companies is really low on the totem pole. Peo&lt;br/&gt;ple who move up the latter in the knowledge world tend to drift away from the content and their distance leads to neglect.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I don't think these practices should be that difficult to adopt but they are rare outside of software development. The obstacles are probably mostly based on culture. Old habits are difficult to break. I think another issue is that knowledge assets are commonly thought of as a &lt;em&gt;by-product&lt;/em&gt; of the work rather than the &lt;em&gt;purpose&lt;/em&gt; of the work (like software is). Therefore, there is less urgency in addressing the quality of the assets. But if institutional knowledge is a priority of the organization, the assets themselves need greater attention and investment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Further reading:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2005/03/managing-projects-the-open-way.html"&gt;Managing projects the open way&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2006/08/managing-projects-with-trac.html"&gt;Managing projects with Trac&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</content>

    <title>Web Meetings Revisited</title>
    <content type='html'>A few weeks ago I wrote a &lt;a href="http://blog.contenthere.net/2008/06/watch-out-webex.html"&gt;post about WebEx alternatives&lt;/a&gt;.  My conclusion was that there are some good options for sharing a PowerPoint presentation but WebEx was one of the few services that allowed a non-Windows user to share his screen for a software demonstration.  WebEx isn't cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just learned about a service called &lt;a href="http://yuuguu.com"&gt;Yuuguu&lt;/a&gt; that seems to work pretty well.  Yuuguu is a free service works like an IM client on Windows, Mac, and Linux.  All meetings participants need to download and install the client and register for the service.  This is not ideal for one off meetings with people you don't usually work with (like a sales demo).   Yuuguu is much more appropriate for distributed teams that work regularly together.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The service pays for itself (or at least intends to - I don't know if they are profitable) by recommending a free conference service (British Telecom's Powwow Now) to use during your meeting.  If you don't pay extra for your long distance dialing into the free conference number will not cost you anything. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content>

    <title>Novelty + Urgency = Chaos</title>
    <content type='html'>Around a year and a half ago, I coined "&lt;a href="http://blog.contenthere.net/2006/05/email-and-content-management.html"&gt;Gottlieb's law&lt;/a&gt;," which I suppose should officially be a theorem because it has not been conclusively proven. It certainly hasn't been disproved though. Because I will probably never be able to prove that "a company's success in content management is inversely proportional to the amount of information that is exchanged over email," I figured I would move on with a new theorem. Here goes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gottlieb's 2nd Law (or theorem)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Novelty + Urgency = Chaos&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This comes from an observation that when companies put a development team (or any other kind of team) in a pressurized environment and give them new technologies and tools to work with, chaos ensues. Developers don't have time to learn the new platform so they hastily try to apply legacy practices and ideas which are not necessarily appropriate for the new technology. To make matters worse, this chaos is difficult to work out of the system even after developers have learned better. Time simply hasn't been budgeted to go back and correct the mistakes that were made. Sometimes known bad habits are even repeated just for consistencies sake.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here is how it usually plays out in the world of web content management. A company buys a new CMS and intends to migrate 50-100 sites onto the new platform. The team takes a deliberately cautious approach of choosing the simplest example as a starting point/test case. After an easy experience building out the pilot site, the team writes out a migration plan that begins with the biggest site (who has been clamoring to be early because they are feeling real pain on the old platform). Before long this project blows up. The additional complexity of the larger site was not adequately accounted for in the project plan and the team is falling behind. Their unfamiliarity with the new API causes them to write hacks and work-arounds for features that are well supported by the platform - if only they knew how to use it. The longer the delay, the greater the pressure that squeezes out general practices like refactoring, code review, unit testing, and even communication. When a developer makes a new discovery, he will maybe apply it to new code but is rarely able to go back and fix sloppy, inexperienced code.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first big site is delayed but that doesn't mean that the original migration plan is abandoned. A new development team is spun up to work on the next site. Of course, these guys are new to the platform. The seasoned developers are too busy with their death march to release the first site to share what they learned.&lt;br/&gt;The new team either uses the first site as a model or tries to do everything the opposite way. The same things happens for the next couple of sites so every site is built in a different way and it is impossible to maintain them. Three years later, when the CMS is replaced, poor manageability is cited as a primary reason for moving off the platform. The chaotic condition of the code base and content makes the next migration harder. And then cycle continues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How could this be avoided? It is not so easy. Usually a CMS purchase is supported by a business case that needs to be optimistic about both cost and benefit in order to get the ROI to look right. This innocent little exercise of telling a story that the management wants to hear is where the problems begin. Maybe it would have been better to explore the option of upgrading and refactoring the current platform and comparing the ROIs of the two approaches. Both migration and upgrading are complicated process that are full of surprises.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The next error is the assumption that building out sites will be like turning a crank. It may get that way eventually but the first few are as hard as building custom software. There are lots of choices and lots of places to make mistakes. Ideally, the sequence would be: (tiny) pilot site, medium site 1, &lt;em&gt;rebuild medium site 1&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;build re-usable components and patterns&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;build a reference implementation based on the rebuilt site 1&lt;/em&gt;. After that the rest of the new sites can be built on a reference implementation that gets gradually improved as new ideas are tried out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whoever is holding the budget is cringing right now. Not only is this making more migration work (two+ additional sites), it is lengthening the time to benefit for the most important sites that may be funding this whole migration in the first place. It also means paying developers to do things other than coding: documenting, teaching, learning, and &lt;em&gt;recoding&lt;/em&gt;. As expensive as this is, the costs are trivial when compared to the price of doing it wrong and feeling the need to replace the system years ahead of schedule.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another strategy is to work with a systems integrator who has a long track record of working on the platform you selected. Of course, this only works if a) the consultants you get on the team really know the platform and b) you didn't beat them down on price so they need to cut corners and work sloppily. You really need to trust the systems integrator and partner with them to achieve joint success. These trustworthy partners don't come cheap either because they tend to be honest and conservative in their pricing. At the end of the day you may save money but the initial price tag will be discouraging when compared with others who want to tell you what you want to hear.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Too often people tend the focus on migrating the content itself during a CMS implementation. Migrating the content can be messy if it needs to be cleaned up first but there are at least some possibilities for automation (or at least hiring cheap temps to manually copy/paste). Rendering and integration code, conversely, is not at all portable (except for CSS - write as much presentation code as you can in CSS) and can be a real challenge to translate to a new platform. Porting the code is most efficient when developers can take the time to learn the new platform and logically break down the site to leverage the technology's native strengths and best practices. When under time pressure, the tendency is to revert to comfortable old ways even if they are counter-productive. And the downward spiral continues...</content>

    <title>More Users = Simpler CMS</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I just read James Robertson's short article &lt;a href="http://www.steptwo.com.au/papers/cmb_moreequalssimpler/index.html"&gt;"More Users = Simpler CMS."&lt;/a&gt;.  In it, James puts forth a proposition that if you are deploying a company wide CMS, it should be as simple as possible.  This idea runs directly against the CMS buying behavior over the last couple of years where companies rolling out the large CMS implementations were looking for "industrial grade" software that had all the bells and whistles.  Cross departmental software selection committees aggregated their feature wish lists to come up with selection criteria that favored products that had (or at least claimed to have) everything.  And after all this, companies were surprised to find that the implemented solutions were difficult to use and required more training than was budgeted for. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think the tide is changing from feature richness to simplicity and usability.  A couple of other data points:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Salesforce.com like ASP CMS solutions are gaining popularity&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oracle's ECM product has been designed for simplicity.  In the words of Rich Buchheim, Oracle's senior director of product management: "From the user's perspective it's not different than using a desktop application or file server."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leading CMS industry analyst Tony Byrne of CMS Watch sees usability as being one of the most important trends in content management:  "In conference rooms around the world, authors are standing up and declaring, 'Our CMS tool sucks!' Many CMS vendors have noted this user backlash and now fall over themselves to tout products as "intuitive," "adaptive," or just plain "easy to use."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the world of CMS, sometimes less is more.  Maybe its the feature that the software &lt;i&gt;does not have&lt;/i&gt; that will make it a success.</content>

    <title>Newspaper Next</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I just read a very interesting report by the &lt;a href="http://www.americanpressinstitute.org/"&gt;American Press Institute&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href="http://www.newspapernext.org/2005/09/report_availability_1.htm"&gt;"Blueprint For Transformation&lt;/a&gt;".  This report is from a project called &lt;a href="http://www.newspapernext.org/"&gt;Newspaper Next&lt;/a&gt; (or N2) which has been charged to study how the newspaper industry can respond to a new media landscape driven by the Internet. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report is free if you register (and I have not been called by a salesperson yet so I think it is safe) and there are also conferences happening throughout the country to discuss it.  If you are in Boston area, mark your calendars for &lt;a href="http://www.americanpressinstitute.org/07/N2Boston/"&gt;February 23rd&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report contains some very well written analysis of the disruptive impact of the Internet to traditional publishing models and applies to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disruptive_technology"&gt;Clay Christensen &lt;i&gt;Disruptive Technology&lt;/i&gt; theory to explain what is happening&lt;/a&gt;.  Some interesting points:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;We have a new reality were people can get information anytime and any place they want it.  They can also publish at will.  The social impact of these new publishing models enabled by the internet is on the scale of the advent movable type and mass literacy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People consume more media (7.5 hours a day) from more sources.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The fragmentation of information sources has changed the advertising market. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Traditional newspaper websites are squeezing an old product into a new technology.  This practice, known as "cramming," tends to overlook new opportunities created by the new technology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Although the challenges are very real, the study does not suggest that newspaper businesses should lie down and accept their destiny of irrelevance.  Instead they advocate creating portfolio companies that leverage their strengths to create disruptive technologies of their own.  Included in this recommendation is a methodology for innovation and some general business strategies.  The concepts are germane to anyone doing business in the information economy.</content>

    <title>Is Wordpress the Microsoft Windows of Web Content Management?</title>
    <content type='html'>We run our corporate marketing sites on Wordpress. It's not the perfect web content management system for us but, as long as we keep things simple, it does the job reasonably well. When we want to do something that Wordpress doesn't comfortably handle, we tend to use an alternative platform such as Marketo, UnBounce, or develop static web pages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wordpress is great, but one thing to consider when using it is that you make yourself a target to all sorts of hacker attacks. When planning server capacity, we need to accept that a lot of our traffic comes from bots trying to hack into WP Admin. There are three things about Wordpress that contribute to this.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wordpress is by far the most commonly used web content management system.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://trends.builtwith.com/cms"&gt;According to BuiltWith, 47.90% of CMS powered websites run on WordPress&lt;/a&gt;. The second most commonly used CMS is Drupal with 13.10%. Now I know that those statistics are not perfect but it is clear that Wordpress is head and shoulders above the competition when it comes to CMS adoption.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wordpress is incredibly easy to identify.&lt;/strong&gt; If you look at the source of any Wordpress generated page, Wordpress's signature is impossible to miss. Moreover, Wordpress makes it really hard to hide these tells even if you wanted to.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wordpress is the "go-to" platform for people who know nothing about web development or security.&lt;/strong&gt; While there are plenty of savvy WordPress developers out there, the majority of WordPress sites were built by people with no clue about security and operated by companies with limited technical know-how. Many of these sites were insecure from day one and only got worse as patching and other maintenance practices were neglected.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Put these three facts together and it is obvious why WordPress is the most attractive platform for hackers and botnets to attack. If you are a malicious hacker and want to get the most out of your efforts, you go after the biggest and most vulnerable target. And in that way, WordPress is a lot like Windows. Windows is everywhere because it is the go-to OS for people who just want a computer at a reasonable price. If you walk into a BestBuy/Staples/Costco to buy a computer, you will walk out with a Windows PC unless you have something else in mind. The majority of these computer shoppers know very little about managing their computers. These users will not keep their software up to date and will accept any dialog. Most of us have spent countless holiday hours removing adware, browser bars, and viruses from these computers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just to be clear: Wordpress and Windows are not inherently insecure. With conscientious maintenance, both of these platforms can be as safe to use as the alternatives. It as a sign of success for both Windows and Wordpress that they have earned the distinction of being prime targets for hackers. It is also a great opportunity for external software companies to market services to secure these platforms. The Windows security software market is already large and mature. The number of Wordpress security options is growing fast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So my advice to everyone is to keep on using Wordpress if it meets your requirements. But accept that your site will be a target for hackers and plan for security. Work with Wordpress specialists (not designers who happen to know a little about Wordpress theming). Follow all the advice in the &lt;a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Hardening_WordPress"&gt;"Hardening Wordpress" page&lt;/a&gt;. Look into 3rd party services that help protect your site. Be safe</content>

    <title>IBM agrees to buy FileNet for $1.6 bln</title>
    <content type='html'>And the mergers and acquisitions continue....  As analysts have been saying for months, infrastructure companies are buying up the content management pure plays and calling ECM infrastructure.  &lt;a href="http://www.ibm.com"&gt;IBM&lt;/a&gt; recently announced that they are buying &lt;a href="http://www.filenet.com"&gt;FileNet&lt;/a&gt;.   That leaves &lt;a href="http://www.vignette.com"&gt;Vignette&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.stellent.com"&gt;Stellent&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.interwoven.com"&gt;Interwoven&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.broadvision.com"&gt;BroadVision&lt;/a&gt; for companies like &lt;a href="http://www.sun.com"&gt;Sun&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.hp.com"&gt;HP&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.redhat.com"&gt;RedHat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.novell.com"&gt;Novell&lt;/a&gt;, etc. to fight over. I don't know who is going to pair with who but if I had to guess...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sun buys Vignette&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Novell buys BroadVision&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Red Hat buys Alfresco&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;HP buys Interwoven who buys Stellent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Google makes them all irrelevant ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</content>

    <title>The biggest thing since wood pulp</title>
    <content type='html'>One of my favorite podcasts, &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/"&gt;Planet Money&lt;/a&gt;, recently did a &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2009/12/podcast_the_cost_of_bias.html"&gt;segment on bias in journalism&lt;/a&gt;.  Apparently, back in the 1870's, most newspapers were blatantly affiliated with a political party.  In fact, their bias was openly stated in their mission statement and it was part of the newspaper industry business model.  In return for political support, a newspaper publisher would get lucrative contracts for printing government documents and cushy government posts like postmaster.  You historians will remember that Ben Franklin, himself a publisher, was the first postmaster general.  The newspaper publishers didn't do this because they were greedy or unscrupulous; it was hard to make a living publishing a paper any other way.  The cost of printing and distributing a paper was more than the audience could afford.  Given the options of the low return of serving an audience that can't afford your product or the high return of serving a political party, the choice was easy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But then a big technology disruption happened that drastically cut the cost of publishing a newspaper and all of the sudden made the business more profitable.  It wasn't the Internet, it was cheap paper made from wood pulp.  Up until that point, the news was printed on rag paper like what our dollars bills are made of.  With cheaper paper, a publisher could lower the price and get a higher volume of sales.  You could sell even more papers if you had higher quality news.  More newspapers entered the market but there were still barriers to entry to preserve profits.  Even though the variable cost of the papers was low, the up front fixed costs of the presses and distribution channels kept competition manageable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like wood pulp, the Internet also disrupted the news business but in a different ways.  While the Internet has reduced the cost of distributing the news (especially over large geographic areas), it has also driven the revenues down.  Most importantly, the classifieds business has been eaten up by sites like Craigslist.  Advertisers have other options to reach a more targeted audience than general news can.  And, of course, there are no barriers to entry.  Even an schmo like me can have a blog.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will the decline of profitability push publishers back to bias?  There are some concerning signs. Not so much with the big media brands (although you could definitely make the argument that all publications have their leanings), but there are plenty of examples in blogosphere (and Twitter) where bloggers are paid to promote a product or political agenda.  The distinction between professional and amateur media is blurring.  We tend to follow people (professionals and amateurs) who share our passion (usually on very narrow topics) and we unsubscribe when they lose our interest or confidence.  But very few people are getting rich on having us as an audience — not until they sell out and exploit our trust.  Then we will leave as quickly as we came because there is bound to be a fresh new voice that values our attention as unprofitable as it may be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As an audience that wants to be informed, we need to do two things.... First, we need to figure out a way to compensate for the value that we enjoy.  There have been some interesting ideas of establishing non-profits and public-media style structures.  Second, we need to become very good critical thinkers.  We need to be able to filter and verify the information that is bombarding us.  We need to become our own editors if we can't immediately trust anything in print.  I am sure that is what people did back in the 1860's did too.</content>

    <title>PHP + JCR = PHPCR</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;My former colleague &lt;a href="http://pooteeweet.org/"&gt;Lukas Kahwe Smith&lt;/a&gt; recently gave me a update on what is happening with the &lt;a href="http://phpcr.github.com/"&gt;PHPCR initiative&lt;/a&gt;.  Readers of this blog might remember me make &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2010/12/jackalope-a-php-port-of-the-jcr.html"&gt;a brief mention of PHPCR and the Jackalope implementation&lt;/a&gt;. My initial response was that I was unsure of whether the idea would take off but now I am pretty impressed with what I heard from Lukas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lukas and his team from &lt;a href="http://www.liip.ch/"&gt;Liip AG&lt;/a&gt; have been contributing to Jackalope as part of a large custom, content-centric web application they are building for a client using &lt;a href="http://symfony.com/"&gt;Symfony2&lt;/a&gt;.  Jackalope goes beyond standard relational database persistence by providing sophisticated content services like content hierarchy, tree traversal, versioning, and content staging &amp;mdash; common weaknesses in &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2007/07/homebrew-cms.html"&gt;homebrew CMSs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can see a number of benefits to a PHP developer using PHPCR&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;li&gt;There is less to build than when working directly against a REST interface like &lt;a href="http://sling.apache.org/site/index.html"&gt;Apache Sling&lt;/a&gt;.  You don't have to worry about making requests and marshaling XML or JSON into programmable PHP objects.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Your code can store any type of data in the JCR (not just documents).  Using CMIS would be a bit of a stretch for anything but document data.  Liip has developed an &lt;a href="https://github.com/doctrine/phpcr-odm"&gt;object-to-JCR node mapping layer (called phpcr-odm. Part of the Doctrine project)&lt;/a&gt; that behaves like a PHP &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping"&gt;ORM&lt;/a&gt; service.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;li&gt;The persistence engine is abstracted so you can swap it out with something that meets your performance needs. Jackalope ships with &lt;a href="http://jackrabbit.apache.org/"&gt;Apache JackRabbit&lt;/a&gt; but there are also transports in the works for &lt;a href="http://www.mongodb.org/"&gt;MongoDB&lt;/a&gt; and standard SQL databases.  They should be mature by the end of the year.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;li&gt;You can use PHP to build delivery tiers and other web applications using content managed in a JCR-based CMS (such as &lt;a href="http://www.day.com/day/en/products.html"&gt;Adobe CQ5&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.onehippo.com/en/products/cms"&gt;HippoCMS&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="http://www.magnolia-cms.com/"&gt;Magnolia&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are building a content-centric web application in PHP, and you find yourself doing unnatural things to a relational database to meet your requirements, consider using Jackalope or the &lt;a href="https://github.com/bergie/phpcr-midgard2"&gt;Midgard PHPCR implementation (which is designed more for speed)&lt;/a&gt;.  You are probably already be using Lucene for search indexing, how much trouble can one more Java application be to manage on your infrastructure?&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Making developer docs more accessible</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;div class="thumbnail"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skitch.com/sggottlieb/by1yu/java-ee-crxdeploy-build.xml-eclipse-sdk-users-sethgottlieb-documents-projects-clients-time-interactive-development-crx-clean-ab"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.skitch.com/20090108-tesidbny4jp3i354npbddpajy6.preview.jpg" alt="Java EE - crxdeploy/build.xml - Eclipse SDK - /Users/sethgottlieb/Documents/projects/clients/time_interactive/development/crx-clean-ab" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Lucida Grande, Trebuchet, sans-serif, Helvetica, Arial; font-size: 10px; color: #808080"&gt;Uploaded with &lt;a href="http://plasq.com/"&gt;plasq&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="http://skitch.com"&gt;Skitch&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What do developers hate more than writing documentation? Writing documentation that nobody will read.  I think everyone has been in a meeting and heard someone complain about needing some information that they didn't even bother to search the wiki or document repository for.  But what if the documentation was already in the developers face?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="thumbnail"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skitch.com/sggottlieb/byqie/new"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.skitch.com/20090107-x5sbxed6ngrum73f9jcstww2i3.preview.jpg" alt="New" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Lucida Grande, Trebuchet, sans-serif, Helvetica, Arial; font-size: 10px; color: #808080"&gt;Uploaded with &lt;a href="http://plasq.com/"&gt;plasq&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="http://skitch.com"&gt;Skitch&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A few weeks ago, a client turned me onto "Cheat Sheets" in &lt;a href="http://www.eclipse.org"&gt;Eclipse&lt;/a&gt;.  Those are the little instructions that appear on the right-most frame of the Eclipse IDE.  You may have used one of these Cheat Sheets before (and not known what they were called) but you probably didn't know how easy they are to create.  Simply choose the "File | New | Other" menu option and then, under "User Assistance," select Cheat Sheet.  This will give you a simple editing tool to create step by step instructions.  The underlying XML is very simple so you can also just use Eclipse XML editor if you want to.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="thumbnail"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skitch.com/sggottlieb/byqi7/java-ee-crxdeploy-testing.xml-eclipse-sdk-users-sethgottlieb-documents-projects-clients-time-interactive-development-crx-clean-ab"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.skitch.com/20090107-qt7at1q93ubrftcu4ri5bk3tj4.preview.jpg" alt="Java EE - crxdeploy/testing.xml - Eclipse SDK - /Users/sethgottlieb/Documents/projects/clients/time_interactive/development/crx-clean-ab" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Lucida Grande, Trebuchet, sans-serif, Helvetica, Arial; font-size: 10px; color: #808080"&gt;Uploaded with &lt;a href="http://plasq.com/"&gt;plasq&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="http://skitch.com"&gt;Skitch&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This form of documentation is best for things like development environment setup.  It is not so great for API or architectural documentation.  It assumes that the developer is using Eclipse and has been able to check the appropriate source tree out of the source code repository because the documentation is stored within the project.  I would use this in conjunction with a README and INSTALL file.  README would be used for information about the application (version, usage, recent changes, open issues).  INSTALL would be for someone installing the compiled application.  The Cheat Sheet(s) would be for developers that are getting their Eclipse environment together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Is anyone else using this feature? If so, have you found it effective?</content>

    <title>Blogs, Wiki&amp;#39;s, etc.</title>
    <content type='html'>A couple of months ago a WCMS sales guy said to me that when hears the words "we are looking for blogs, wikis, etc." from a customer it is a clear indication that the customer really doesn't know what he is talking about or (at least) doesn't have a clear vision of  goals for Web 2.0.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I too am suspicious (and a little surprised) when I hear these terms together because, other than the fact that they are relatively new to the "enterprise," blogs and wikis have little to do with each other.  Bob Doyle wrote a very good article differentiating these technologies way back in 2006 (&lt;a href="http://www.econtentmag.com/Articles/Column/I-Column-Like-I-CM/When-to-Wiki,-When-to-Blog-16900.htm"&gt;When to Wiki, When to Blog&lt;/a&gt; - read the article).  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A blog is a publishing system and a wiki is a collaboration tool.  A blog author writes &lt;em&gt;articles (posts)&lt;/em&gt; which reflect an idea or an observation at a point of time.  You don't typically update a blog entry unless you see a typo that annoys too much to ignore (like misspelling your name - as on of my recent posts).  Comments provide a forum for a dialog around the topic.  These comments may appear within the context of the blog site or somewhere else as in the case of &lt;a href="http://friendfeed.com/"&gt;friendfeed&lt;/a&gt; but they are a &lt;em&gt;conversation around the article&lt;/em&gt;, not the article itself.  Occasionally the blog author will highlight a comment by updating the blog with a reference but this is the exception not the rule.  If the author changes his mind, he will write another post rather than update the original.  To learn from blogs you read lots of posts and piece together a consistent understanding that works for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A wiki is a tool to collaboratively build a comprehensive informational resource.  Rather than blog posts that a single author publishes to an audience, a wiki page allows a group of people to jointly define a topic, establish a policy, or create some other information resource that needs to be updated over time.  Companies that use a wiki (rather than a WCMS) as their intranet have come to the conclusion that potentially anyone in the company could correct or otherwise improve the information there.  If these contributions are wrong, their updates can be corrected or rolled back.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WCMS can serve both of these publishing and information management purposes.  For example, a typical implementation "corporate brochure" of a CMS will publish "point-in-time" articles (e.g. press releases) and manage fixed pages (e.g. "about us").  If you need to do both with one tool (and want the option to strictly control contribution), you probably need a WCMS.  If you need to do one of these things but not the other, you might be in the market for a blog &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; a wiki but not "blogs, wikis, etc."</content>

    <title>Jeff Cram: Your website is not a project</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Jeff Cram started blog series called &lt;a href="http://www.cmsmyth.com/2010/05/the-post-launch-paradigm/"&gt;post launch paradigm&lt;/a&gt; with a great post called "&lt;a href="http://www.cmsmyth.com/2010/06/your-website-is-not-a-project"&gt;Your website is not a project&lt;/a&gt;."  The article lists all the ways companies fail when they think of a website as a project to be completed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a website is not a project, what is it?  Jeff calls it an "ongoing process."  I call it a "product."  &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2010/05/tips-for-web-product-management.html"&gt;Website product management&lt;/a&gt; is becoming an increasingly important service offering for Content Here and it is a natural extension of the selection work that I have been doing over the first three years of the company.  During a selection engagement I create a road map of functionality to be implemented over time and &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2009/08/dimensions-of-success-or-ways-to-fail.html"&gt;set expectations&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2010/02/the-myth-of-the-occasional-cms-user.html"&gt;user adoption&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2009/07/you-bought-a-web-page-factory-not-a-webmaster-android.html"&gt;incremental improvement&lt;/a&gt;.  Recently selection clients have been engaging Content Here after implementation to help them progress along that road map.  This feels great on a number of levels: these clients realize that their websites are not projects, they have bought in to the concept of continuous improvement, and I get to see the clients working with the products that they have selected.  I even get to go through code once in a while!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Z3ECM</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I recently &lt;a href="http://contenthere.blogspot.com/2005/10/goldegg.html"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; about the &lt;a href="http://www.goldeggstack.org/"&gt;Goldegg&lt;/a&gt; project and was interested to learn about another project related to arrival of &lt;a href="http://www.zope.org/DevHome/Wikis/DevSite/Projects/ComponentArchitecture/FrontPage"&gt;Zope 3 &lt;/a&gt;:  &lt;a href="http://www.z3ecm.org/"&gt;Z3ECM&lt;/a&gt;.  Z3ECM is a project to build an Enterprise Content Management System (ECM) on Zope 3 and is being supported by France-based &lt;a href="http://www.nuxeo.com/en"&gt;Nuxeo software&lt;/a&gt; which also manages &lt;a href="http://www.cps-project.org/"&gt;Collaborative Portal Server (CPS)&lt;/a&gt; - an ECM framework built on Zope 2.  Some Z3ECM components will be incorporated in CPS in release 3.6 (3.4 is due out next month) and CPS v 4.0 will be built entirely on Z3ECM.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Projects like &lt;a href="http://codespeak.net/z3/five/"&gt;Five&lt;/a&gt;, Goldegg, and Z3ECM are critical to Zope 3's success because they will help products (like Plone and CMF), which made Zope 2 so successful, move forward in a Zope 3 world.  Of course, even though Zope 3 is out and seems to be gaining momentum, there is nothing forcing Zope 2 users to upgrade.  One of the great things about open source software is that users of open source are free to make decisions of if/when to upgrade.  With the large install base of Zope 2, there is likely to be a Zope 2 community for quite some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zope 3 is nearly a total rewrite of the Zope platform.  The overall goal is to make Zope easier to develop on by making the code more modular and incorporating some critical features into the core.  The use of "interfaces" which are often used in Java applications to make software more object oriented ("polymorphism" is the OO term) Most notably, some aspects of Content Management Framework (CMF), a Zope "Product" (application that runs on Zope) which is used by most Zope based CMS applications, are being folded into the core.  One of Goldegg's goals is to develop a new CMF, composed of the features that are not implemented in Zope 3 core, on top of Five (Zope 3 functionality running on Zope 2) and eventually Zope 3.  If you want to learn more about Zope 3, there are two professionally published books available: &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;tag=contenthere-20&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;path=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/3540223592?v=glance%26n=283155%26n=507846%26s=books%26v=glance"&gt;Web Component Development with Zope 3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=contenthere-20&amp;amp;l=ur2&amp;amp;o=1" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;tag=contenthere-20&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;path=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0672326175?v=glance%26n=283155%26n=507846%26s=books%26v=glance"&gt;Zope 3 Developer's Handbook, First Edition (Paperback)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=contenthere-20&amp;amp;l=ur2&amp;amp;o=1" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Drupalcon 2008</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;b&gt;[Update: &lt;a href="http://buytaert.net/state-of-drupal-presentation-march-2008"&gt;here are the slides and the recorded presentation in case you couldn't be there&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="http://media.contenthere.net/blgimages/drupalconScreen.png"/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am back home in Florence after a couple days at &lt;a href="http://boston2008.drupalcon.org/"&gt;Drupalcon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.aiimexpo.com/aiimexpo2007/v42/index.cvn"&gt;AIIM&lt;/a&gt;.  It was great to see all my colleagues at both events.  I didn't attend any of the AIIM sessions but I did catch a few of the Drupalcon talks.  Here are some quick notes and observations.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drupalcon was huge.  The attendance doubled from 400 last year in Barcelona to over 800 this year and there were people turned away because the venue was at capacity.  AIIM was also pretty well attended - at least on the Expo floor.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://boston2008.drupalcon.org/session/report-formal-usability-testing-university-minnesota-libraries"&gt;Drupal Usability&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;I arrived a little late and squeaked into the session "&lt;a href="http://boston2008.drupalcon.org/session/report-formal-usability-testing-university-minnesota-libraries"&gt;Report from formal Drupal usability testing at the University of Minnesota Libraries&lt;/a&gt;," which reported results of non-Drupal users trying to do 7 tasks in Drupal.  The study looked very professional and well executed.  Unfortunately I missed Task 1 which most of the users got hung up on.  For more information, you can go to the &lt;a href="http://groups.drupal.org/usability"&gt;Drupal Usability Group&lt;/a&gt; where there is already a nice discussion and the team plans to post the slides, video and other findings.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At a high level, I think it was great that the Drupal community was able to do this.  No one was at all defensive and everyone seemed excited to fixed the problems uncovered.  They welcomed external criticism and that is a good characteristic of an open source project.    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the specific points from my notes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Newbies are confused by the stuff that the pros just ignore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Help was not helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Even after tweaking of the terminology (less references to the word "node"), users are still confused.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There needs to be a good glossary.  There used to be one but it was removed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are too many options and that buries the important stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There should be tutorials.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A common complaint was that users lost the page that they just created.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Keynote&lt;/h4&gt;Dries did a good keynote on the state of Drupal (that is strong, by the way).  Some specific notes....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drupal 6 came out with February 16th, like previous Drupal releases, it was big.  The number of downloads over the first month doubled the first month (100,000 vs 50,000 for first month of Drupal 5).  There were 741  contributors (Drupal 5 had 472).  And several thousand more fix/enhancement patches than Drupal 5.  There are now 20,000 live Drupal 6 instances pinging home.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward, the Drupal community wants to improve the project to make it ready for the next wave of adopters.  This includes addressing pain points like module compatibility and expanding Drupal's relevance.  One nice quote was "the Social Graph just connects people. we have the opp to build a graph that connects everything."  Dries went into a discussion of the semantic web and RDF and how Drupal could be a major player.  Not a lot of people can get away with promising about the semantic web.  I guess Dries is one of those people.  Here are some ideas:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Web 1.0 = WCM&lt;br /&gt;Web 2.0 = Web 1.0 + user management + infinite extensibility&lt;br /&gt;Web 3.0 = Web 2.0 + infinite interoperability&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RDF is the way to achieve infinite interoperability and federated data sources.  In my opinion, Drupal is very weak in this area and in things like web services and REST style interfaces.  Drupal developers are very database oriented and tend to use MySQL replication to move data around rather than application to application APIs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Getting into specific features, Drupal faces the &lt;a href="http://contenthere.blogspot.com/2008/02/plone-strategic-planning-session.html"&gt;same dilemma that Plone and every other content management system face&lt;/a&gt;: is it a framework for developers or is it an application for business users?  Dries took a mathematical strategy to solving the problem.  A survey of the Drupal community found that 32% wanted to focus on end users of small to medium sites, 44% wanted to focus on enterprise users, and 24% wanted to focus on developers.  Out of that he concluded that Drupal 7 should have 70% user facing features and 30% developer oriented improvements.  It is a simple solution but I don't know if I buy it.  In particular, this approach makes it hard to do some of the major refactoring that projects sometimes have to do in order to prepare for a new set of features or reach a new market.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dries also predicted that Drupal 7 would be out October 15th 2008.  In the past the community had been very reluctant to put out target dates.  It will be nice to see them make this date that they set.  Having &lt;a href="http://www.acquia.com"&gt;Acquia&lt;/a&gt; pushing things along and dedicating developers like they did with Drupal 6 will help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More robust testing practices were also mentioned.  There was talk about getting a testing framework into the core and establishing testing procedures.  This will help improve the quality of the code and make it easier for Drupal to get into more demanding IT organizations.  Better testing procedures will also make it easier for the contributor community to safely grow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://boston2008.drupalcon.org/session/drupal-and-knight-foundation"&gt;Drupal and the Knight Foundation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.knightfoundation.org/"&gt;Knight Foundation&lt;/a&gt; is giving away a lot of money through the &lt;a href="http://www.newschallenge.org/index_lang.html"&gt;News Challenge&lt;/a&gt; to users and developers that are using Drupal to transform community news.  &lt;a href="http://www.newschallenge.org/winners/lwilliams.html"&gt;Lisa Williams&lt;/a&gt; was there to talk about &lt;a href="http://www.placeblogger.com/"&gt;PlaceBlogger.com&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.newschallenge.org/winners/melancon.html"&gt;Benjamin MelanÃ§on&lt;/a&gt; talked about his "related" module.  For more information on what newspapes are doing on Drupal, see &lt;a href="http://groups.drupal.org/newspapers-on-drupal"&gt;Newspapers on Drupal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://boston2008.drupalcon.org/session/drupalcon-tutorial-best-practices-development-environments-staging-build-management-and-prod"&gt;Drupal Configuration Management&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;Configuration management (as in managing multiple environments and promoting code forward from development to production and pushing content back from production to QA) in Drupal has always been a pet peeve of mine.  To put it simply, there is no good or standard way to do it.  The core issue is that Drupal stores a lot of configuration in the database and there is no good way to move a configuration from one instance to another.  A second component of the problem is that IDs are overly important in Drupal because most developers use IDs in their application logic but these IDs are randomly assigned by database sequences.  I think these configuration management issues will keep Drupal from being adopted by large development teams building huge sites.  I sat through a &lt;a href="http://boston2008.drupalcon.org/session/drupalcon-tutorial-best-practices-development-environments-staging-build-management-and-prod"&gt;session on this topic&lt;/a&gt; and a Birds of a Feather discussion only to learn that everyone is doing some hack or another.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hacks break down into two categories: use a macro tool like the Devel module or a third party application to record and replay the clicking of options in the admin forms; use ranges of IDs for settings that are owned by different environments.  The latter is the preferred&lt;br/&gt;method by advanced developers.  They do things like start the sequence of dev at 1 and the sequence of production at 5,000 so there are no collisions.  Or they use odd numbers for development and even numbers for production.  Neither approach is straight-foward or scalable.  Developers talked about all these database scripts and diff'ing processes that they have created.  I would really like to see some fundamental improvements in this area like using the file system to store these settings and best practices in coding to avoid using IDs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;[Update: Jean-Baptiste Ingold was kind enough to record the BoF session and post &lt;a href="http://drupalstaging.blip.tv/%23725427"&gt;it on Blip&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Related links&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://boston2008.drupalcon.org"&gt;Drupalcon 2008 website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.openparenthesis.org/tag/drupalcon2008"&gt;Eckman on Drupalcon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/benfinklea"&gt;Ben Finklea tweeted like crazy on Drupalcon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/drupalcon"&gt;Twitter Feed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/drupalconboston2008"&gt;Flickr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://sgluskin.podomatic.com/"&gt;Audio from Keynote&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content>

    <title>CMS Deployment Patterns</title>
    <content type='html'>One of my favorite terms in the world of Web Content Management is "baking vs. frying," which refers to &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;when&lt;/span&gt; presentation templates are applied to render pages out of structured content.  Baking style rendering systems generate pages when content is published.  Frying systems generate pages on the fly when they are requested by the end user.  Whether a system bakes or fries content tells a lot about its architecture and what it is good at.  Baking systems are great for high volume sites that do not need to personalize content.  Frying systems excel when requirements include personalization, access control, and other presentation logic that uses information about the user in order to decide what to show and how.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While "baking and frying" does a great job of describing how a system is designed, there are lots of slight variations on how to implement a WCMS that are repeatable enough that they deserve names too.  Here are a few.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Web Content Application Framework&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src="http://media.contenthere.net.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/blgimages/WCMWAF.png" alt="" /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;When a frying style CMS has a decent templating language and a other good web application framework functionality (such as user sessions and profiles, a controller to manage URLs, and the ability to import custom and third party libraries) it is very tempting to start building applications on top of it.  In the open source world, you see this happening all the time with projects like Drupal and Plone where you can download and install application like modules (for instance a &lt;a href="http://mamboxchange.com/projects/mambo-phpshop/"&gt;shopping cart&lt;/a&gt; or an &lt;a href="http://plone.org/products/poi"&gt;issue tracking system&lt;/a&gt;).  Products like FatWire position themselves as tools for building dynamic content centric applications.  There is nothing inherently wrong with this strategy but it does run the following risks:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;Lock-in.  Most of the code that you write on a CMS is not portable to another web application framework.  You can mitigate this by writing as little logic as possible in your page templates.  Code in classes is easier to reuse.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;Sub-optimal application design.  CMS presentation tiers are designed for displaying information.  While they may have some transactional capabilities, they may not be as good as a pure web application framework designed for transactions.  You might find yourself doing funny things like making dummy pages in the CMS so you can have a URL that a form can post to.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;Depending on the licensing model, scaling up the architecture for high traffic and fail-over redundancy may be very expensive.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Published Static HTML&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Static deploy is the classic baking style presentation pattern of generating static HTML files.  Nothing special to talk about here other than the fact that this design does not support any server side interactivity. No server side activity means that you can deploy the site across a farm of inexpensive web-servers, making your website infinitely scalable.  If your site serves 200 million content-rich pages a day, this model is probably your only option (unless you are Google).  You can do things like add AJAX libraries to third party services for features like comments, record site traffic, and pulling in dynamic content.  Companies wanting to get a little more interactivity into their managed pages will often use their baking style CMS in a Published View Code pattern.  That is next.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Published View Code&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src="http://media.contenthere.net.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/blgimages/publishViews.png" alt="" /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also called "&lt;a href="http://www.cmswatch.com/Feature/91-The-GRUPA-Gremlin"&gt;parbaked&lt;/a&gt;," Published View is when your baking style CMS writes out un-executed scripting or templating code rather than just static HTML.  This code is then executed at request time for a dynamic user experience.  At the very low end, this could just be server side includes or simple show/hide conditional logic.  At the high end, it could be the View component of an &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller"&gt;MVC pattern&lt;/a&gt;.  This hybrid model has some performance advantages over a fully dynamic site and gives the architect some flexibility as to what presentation technology she can use.  There is also less lock-in because most of the complicated application logic is written into a presentation tier that will not necessarily be replaced when the CMS is swapped out.  This design is also great for when you want to slowly phase in a CMS to manage a site that is already written in a scripting language because dynamically generated scripting code (from the CMS) can coexist with hardcoded scripting code.  Keep an eye out for the following risks:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;This  design complicates the MVC pattern a bit because part of the "model" is baked into the "view." Once the MVC pattern gets kind of broken, it is a slippery slope to start baking more and more model type stuff into the view.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;If you are layering CMS generated views into an MVC architecture with its own controller (that takes in requests and routes them to the appropriate pages), the CMS is going to have less control over the website than it thinks it does.  URLs are going to be different so links may break.  Preview can (and probably will) be a problem.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;The developer may need to work on two systems that require different kinds of skills.  Different departments may even need to get involved.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;Because there is application logic being executed at request time, the delivery environment will require more computing power.  However, you will not need to buy CMS licenses for all the servers on your web farm.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Structured Publishing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src="http://media.contenthere.net.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/blgimages/structuredPublish.png" alt="" /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Structured Publishing is when your CMS publishes content as XML or rows in a relational database rather than pages on a website.  A totally decoupled presentation tier then reads from this "presentation repository" to deliver the website.  Structured assets can also be delivered at request time through a web services or a ReST style API but this requires a lot of computing power on the CMS and some good caching technologies on the delivery tier.  In this model, the CMS has little or no control over the organization or behavior of the website.  I wrote a &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2006/12/area-architect-dreams-of-model.html"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; about this design a while ago so I won't repeat myself here.  This design tends to work the best when content authors are not writing with one presentation channel in mind (for example if they are writing for print, web and sms, they tend not to get too wrapped up in the display on any one channel) and there is a separate group of people that are solely focused on the layout and behavior of the website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Depending on the WCM product that you are working with, these patterns may be more or less obvious but still possible.   For example, frying style WCM systems are designed for the Web Content Application Framework model.  However, I have seen plenty of customers use a tool like &lt;a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/"&gt;wget&lt;/a&gt; to take a static HTML image of a dynamically generated website to deploy to a simple web server farm.  The &lt;a href="http://plone.org/products/entransit"&gt;Enfold Entransit &lt;/a&gt;product allows content to be produced in Plone (a frying style system) and then publish structured content to another delivery tier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I have seen all of these patterns succeed and fail to varying degrees. The biggest driver of success is knowing when to use a pattern and when not to. You need to look at your requirements - both the immediate ones and the long term vision.</content>

    <title>OSCON 2008 Links</title>
    <content type='html'>This summer I have had a crazy travel schedule so I was not able to attend the &lt;a href="http://en.oreilly.com/oscon2008/public/content/home"&gt;OSCON&lt;/a&gt; conference in Portland.  I really need to get out there one of these days.  Fortunately, the &lt;a href="http://en.oreilly.com/oscon2008/public/content/news-coverage"&gt;O'Reilly bloggers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://raibledesigns.com/rd/entry/oscon_2008_wrapup"&gt;Matt Raible&lt;/a&gt; have great notes from the conference. The speaker &lt;a href="http://en.oreilly.com/oscon2008/public/schedule/proceedings"&gt;presentations&lt;/a&gt; are posted on the &lt;a href="http://en.oreilly.com/oscon2008/public/content/home"&gt;OSCON site&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://oscon.blip.tv"&gt;keynotes are supposed to be available on BlipTV&lt;/a&gt; but I just checked and they don't seem to be there yet.  While "virtually" attending a conference doesn't provide all the social and interactive benefits of physically being there, it is better than nothing.</content>

    <title>Dynamite CMS Implementations</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;A "Dynamite CMS implementation" is when an I.T. group deploys a CMS and then runs like hell like it's a stick of dynamite.  You can't deny that they have moved lots of material, but they have also created a mess that will take years to sort out &amp;mdash; and they have conveniently left the scene for the cleanup.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don't mean to bash I.T. here.  If content management was in their queue, along with any number of enterprise technology initiatives, they need to move on to the next project.  They don't normally have a choice.  This gets back to idea of "&lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2010/06/jeff-cram-your-website-is-not-a-project.html"&gt;Content Management is not a Project.&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get back to the Dynamite metaphor, Content management is not like making a hole in a mountain.  It's more like an archeological dig.  Like archeological artifacts, content must be preserved, organized, and continually re-assembled to create meaningful and cohesive stories.  Archeologists and content managers use specialized tools that balance efficiency and precision.  Content management is like archeology in real-time &amp;mdash; new content artifacts are being produced every day.  Some of what we find fits nicely into the organizational structures we have.  Other content challenges our models and tools and forces us to adapt.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whoever is responsible for a new content management initiative needs to understand that this is a program that cannot be walked (or run) away from when a new tool is deployed.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>iECM: Interoperable Enterprise Content Management</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.aiim.org/article-aiim.asp?ID=29284"&gt;iECM&lt;/a&gt; is a new standard being developed through &lt;a href="http://www.aiim.org/"&gt;AIIM&lt;/a&gt; - the organization that developed the first &lt;a href="http://www.aiim.org/about-ecm.asp"&gt;definition of ECM&lt;/a&gt;. The goal is to define a standard or set of standards to allow different Enterprise Content Management software to be able to work together in a heterogeneous environment. As you would expect, if you have been reading this blog, I am very hopeful for this standard. Such a standard would move ECM from a "one CMS to rule all" vision to a more practical distributed environment where different system are connected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on this, you can understand the concern that my experience with the registration process raised.  After looking at the &lt;a href="http://iecm.blogspot.com/"&gt;iECM Blog&lt;/a&gt; and seeing nothing, I figured I should register to the mailing list to see what is going on. And that is where the trouble began.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It turns out that, in order to register, you need to fill out a PDF form.   I run &lt;a href="http://fedora.redhat.com/"&gt;Fedora Core 4&lt;/a&gt; and the default PDF viewer is &lt;a href="http://www.gnome.org/projects/evince/"&gt;Evince&lt;/a&gt;. In Evince, it looked like you were supposed to print out the form, fill it out in ink, then send it in. Not seeing a mail address, or a place to sign (why else would they require a mail form?), I knew something was up. I figured it was an active PDF form after working with them on a project for a big insurance company that needed this technology for some sort of compliance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I downloaded and installed the &lt;a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/"&gt;Adobe Acrobat Viewer&lt;/a&gt;. Using the Adobe Viewer, I saw a submit button! But my hassle was not over. After I filled out the form and hit submit, I got a pop-up asking me to select my mail client. &lt;a href="http://www.mozilla.com/thunderbird/"&gt;Thunderbird&lt;/a&gt; was not on the list. I had to save a file locally and then attach it to an email to the address on the pop-up (copying and pasting the address and subject was not enabled).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not my idea of interoperability. Interoperability would be to use a standard HTML web form, not a proprietary file format and a proprietary viewer. If it had to be an Adobe technology, they could have used Macromedia's &lt;a href="http://www.macromedia.com/software/coldfusion/"&gt;ColdFusion&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.macromedia.com/software/jrun/"&gt;JRun and Java&lt;/a&gt;. This also hints that this group is really oriented to document management and not web content management. I am still hopeful that this standard can bear some fruit and become meaningful in the content management industry, but this experience was discouraging&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Bricolage gets big boost from Google Summer of Code</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;David Wheeler from the &lt;a href="http://www.bricolage.cc"&gt;Bricolage project&lt;/a&gt;  just &lt;a href="http://www.justatheory.com/bricolage/soc_2006_results.html"&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; the results from three &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/summerofcode.html"&gt;Google Summer of Code&lt;/a&gt; projects.  It looks like the program was a success for Bricolage.  Three contributors were sponsored: Marshall Roch, Christian Muise, and Andrei Arsu.  These developers added some AJAX slickness to the UI, improved the way content types are defined, and (drum roll) added &lt;a href="http://www.mysql.com"&gt;MySQL 5&lt;/a&gt; support for Bricolage.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I really like &lt;a href="http://www.postgresql.org/"&gt;PostgreSQL&lt;/a&gt;.  From a functionality perspective, it has always been well ahead of MySQL.  I think that more people will consider PostgreSQL now that &lt;a href="http://www.enterprisedb.com/"&gt;EnterpriseDB&lt;/a&gt; can give it commercial software style support and provide an easy migration path from &lt;a href="www.oracle.com"&gt;Oracle&lt;/a&gt;.  However, lack of MySQL support was a constant nag on the mail lists and, for some, a barrier to adopting Bricolage.  It is nice to see that that obstacle has been eliminated.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Tips for Web Product Management</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I am currently providing web product management services for two clients.  One client is a start-up launching a new web-based product.  The other is a 100 year old newspaper.  While at face value these two clients couldn't appear to be more different, they are actually quite similar.  Both are trying to innovate a viable product.  The startup is building a new concept.  The newspaper is a trying to re-imagine an old concept.  In both cases the development backlog is a chaotic mess of items that range from little tweaks to major features.  There is impatience for progress; but that urgency needs to be balanced with the need to build something that is scalable and sustainable if the business succeeds.  The truth is most websites operate under these conditions to some degree.  It is just the ambition of these two businesses raises the stakes and the stress level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be successful in these projects, I have had to draw on lots of different skills and experiences.  Many of the concepts and techniques come from agile methodologies like &lt;a href="http://scrummethodology.com/"&gt;Scrum&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_software_development"&gt;Lean software development&lt;/a&gt;.  What follows is a list of principles and practices that I have found to be effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establish a regular (2-3 week) release cycle&lt;/strong&gt;. Everyone benefits from a regular release cycle.  Stakeholders get the satisfaction of seeing progress.  They don't panic if one of their requests doesn't get into the current release if there is a chance that it will be addressed in a subsequent release.  The sooner a new feature hits the production site, the sooner it can be measured and improved. Shorter development cycles also mean smaller releases that are easier to test.  Site visitors perceive a constantly improving site as being vibrant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Define and communicate prioritization criteria&lt;/strong&gt;.  In order to keep releases small, you need a clear and open scoping process.  Enhancement requests need to be evaluated against the site goals (such as creating new revenue opportunities, cutting costs, maintaining credibility, etc.).  Without this kind of guidance, development gets chaotic.  Developer time is not concentrated on work that matters.  The pipeline tends to get clogged with small tweaks; larger, more substantial improvements never get done.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make each release a blend of stakeholder-focused improvements and code maintenance&lt;/strong&gt;.  When code is not regularly optimized and refactored, entropy takes over and it becomes less maintainable.  Development teams that are exclusively driven by stakeholder requests don't have time to keep the codebase clean.  A &lt;a href="http://pragprog.com/the-pragmatic-programmer/extracts/software-entropy"&gt;broken window effect causes messy code to beget messy code.&lt;/a&gt;  For this reason every release milestone should contain a balance of improvements that stakeholders see (new functionality, presentation template changes, etc.) and maintenance tasks (refactoring code, improving management scripts and infrastructure, etc.).  By maintaining this discipline, the quality of the application improves (rather than degrades) over time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't forget the HotFix queue&lt;/strong&gt;.  Even though you might have a methodical development plan, emergencies happen.  In addition to regularly spaced released milestones, I typically create a "HotFix" milestone with a rolling due date of "yesterday."  Emergency requests go into the HotFix queue and get addressed and deployed immediately.  Of course, only I can put things into the HotFix queue and I base that decision on very specific criteria: current functionality is compromised, inaction is costing money (or some other measure of value like reputation), and it is a quick fix.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Write good tickets&lt;/strong&gt;.  Every change request gets entered in a ticket tracking system.  Bug requests should be extremely descriptive: URLs, screenshots, steps to reproduce.  Feature requests take the form of a full specification complete with annotated wireframes or mockups.  Every new element shown needs an annotation describing the source of information and behavior.  It is also a good idea to put in test conditions so that the QA staff know how to verify it is working.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use your source code control system effectively&lt;/strong&gt;.  Create tags to remember milestones in the development history.  Use branches only when you are simultaneously working on two versions of the application.  The most likely reasons for branching are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Having a production branch for hotfixes while development for the next release is done on trunk.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Using an experimentation branch for functionality that may or may not make it into the main code line.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don't use branches for personal work areas or to manage environment-specific configurations.  Merging will be a pain and it will delay any integration testing you will need to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automate deployments&lt;/strong&gt;.  Deployments should be simple and mindless.  There should be one step to push the same exact code that was tested on the QA environment to the production environments.  If someone needs to manually copy individual files, you are doing it wrong.  At a previous client (a very large magazine publisher), we used &lt;a href="http://www.anthillpro.com/html/default.html"&gt;AnthillPro&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html"&gt;continuous integration&lt;/a&gt; and deployments.  Each build of the application was stored in an build artifact library where it could be deployed to different environments with a push of a button.  There were cool reports that showed you want build number was deployed where.  But that was for managing 50+ applications across hundreds of servers.  Now I am using lighter weight tools like &lt;a href="http://docs.fabfile.org/0.9.0/"&gt;Fabric&lt;/a&gt; to script builds and deployments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build a talented and committed team&lt;/strong&gt;.  I strongly believe that there is no room for mediocrity on an agile development team.  Working in this way requires a lot of trust.  Stakeholders need to trust that developers are working efficiently and doing necessary things.  Developers need to rely on each other to communicate and make good decisions.  You don't get that trust unless developers know the technology and are passionate about their craft.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the website or web application that you manage &lt;em&gt;is your product&lt;/em&gt; (or is critical to deliver your product), you need to manage it with this level of discipline and rigor.  Otherwise the site will stagnate and you will be unprepared to respond to new market challenges and opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Drupal and Alfresco</title>
    <content type='html'>Jeff Potts has a nice &lt;a href="http://ecmarchitect.com/archives/2008/05/23/827"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; about how &lt;a href="http://www.alfresco.com/"&gt;Alfresco&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://drupal.org/"&gt;Drupal&lt;/a&gt; complement each other today but will wind up competing as Alfresco develops its front end capability (&lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/reports/alfrescowcm.html"&gt;Alfresco is all back-end&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="http://blog.contenthere.net/2007/01/drupal-meets-bricolage.html"&gt;Drupal is all front end&lt;/a&gt;).  Jeff, who is writing a book on Alfesco and was the &lt;a href="http://blog.contenthere.net/2008/02/jeff-potts-alfresco-contributor-of-year.html"&gt;2007 North American Contributor of the Year for Alfresco&lt;/a&gt;, lists five areas that we can expect Alfresco to improve on the front end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a project moves, it is important to consider where it is coming from (and potentially what it is leaving behind) as well as where it is going.  Sometimes a product's heritage holds it back other times the product leaves a trail of frustrated customers.  Both Drupal and Alfresco are on the move.  Drupal has evolved to be more suitable for very large, commercial websites.  Several people commented that &lt;a href="http://boston2008.drupalcon.org/"&gt;Drupalcon 2008 in Boston&lt;/a&gt; saw a much greater commercial presence than earlier events.  Drupal employers and Drupal related businesses are now active in the Drupal community and are helping to shape its future.  But the Drupal community still has to consider the many small non-profit, departmental and personal sites running on the platform.  Many of the improvements designed to help the enterprise will also help the small guy.  Others times there may be conflict around priorities (do you spend more resources on improving caching and clustering or making it easier to install on &lt;a href="http://www.parallels.com/en/products/plesk/"&gt;Plesk&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.cpanel.net/index.html"&gt;cPanel&lt;/a&gt;?). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alfresco is facing similar questions but it is coming from the other direction.  It's early base was the "ECM for the rest of us" market - medium to large companies doing simple document management.  While the latest improvements on the WCM side are very excited to people wanting to build innovative Web 2.0-style web applications, they may be less relevant to the core customer base.  Alfresco has a lot of resources, but they still need to make choices around prioritization. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is all a matter of not being able to be all things to all people.  Alfresco and Drupal are both fortunate to be in the positions that they are in.  They both have achieved high levels of success in their original target market and are looking to expand their range.  But it is not all about expansion, it is also about focus - what to focus on and what to turn away from.</content>

    <title>Alfresco and Liferay User Group</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.alfresco.com/"&gt;Alfresco&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.liferay.com/web/guest/home"&gt;Liferay&lt;/a&gt; are hosting a &lt;a href="http://web.meetup.com/44/calendar/5819483/"&gt;CMS/Portal user group meeting&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;q=1220+Brea+Canyon+Road,+Walnut,+CA&amp;amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;amp;sspn=67.218143,89.824219&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;ll=34.098159,-117.842102&amp;amp;spn=1.123536,1.403503&amp;amp;amp;amp;z=9&amp;amp;iwloc=addr&amp;amp;om=1"&gt;Ontario, Carlifornia&lt;/a&gt; on  Wednesday July 18th.   I attended the last Alfresco user group in Boston and it was really good.  Based on feedback from the Boston event, they are making this meet-up longer and more round-table focused.  to quote:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Content management and portal software enjoy a natural synergy that begs to be exploited. Join us as we share our knowledge and discuss best practices, integration topics, roadmap ideas, and much more."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Liferay and Alfresco have an interesting partnership.  They come from very different backgrounds.  Liferay started out as a project for a local church and grew into one of the most popular open source portal systems around (in a very competitive portal market).  Alfresco's heritage is in large companies like Documentum and Interwoven and they have quickly become one of the most recognizable names in open source content management.  The two companies were brought together by customers who were using both of their products to build content-centric web applications.  Although, early releases of Alfresco had options to run Alfresco within JBoss Portal, the integration was pretty weak.  More recently, LifeRay &lt;a href="http://www.liferay.com/web/guest/about/news/announcements/alfresco"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that would offer a LifeRay portal/Alfresco bundle.  I haven't tried it out yet, but &lt;a href="http://content.liferay.com/4.2/doc/installation/liferay_4_installation_guide/multipage/ch05s06.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; are the instructions if you want to give it a go.  After that you can go to the user group and let everyone know what you think!</content>

    <title>Acquia</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;CMS Watch just &lt;a href="http://www.cmswatch.com/Trends/1086-VC-funding-for-Drupal?"&gt;reported about a new start-up&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href="http://acquia.com/"&gt;Acquia&lt;/a&gt; that will provide services and products around &lt;a href="http://drupal.org"&gt;Drupal&lt;/a&gt;. Acquia is different from some of the other companies that have tried to make money off the Drupal phenomenon. Unlike &lt;a href="http://www.spikesource.com/"&gt;SpikeSource,&lt;/a&gt; that operates independently from the Drupal community, Acquia has none other than Drupal founder Dries Buytaert on board - he is the CTO. I am intrigued to learn more about what Acquia is going to do and, more importantly, how it will be regarded by the community. It is worth noting that the Drupal trademark and domain belong to Dries - not the recently formed &lt;a href="http://association.drupal.org"&gt;Drupal Association&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content>

    <title>The Employee and the Professional</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joke going around the office: Microsoft buys Yammer, renames it SharePoint Cloud Server 2012 Mobile Enterprise Social Networking Edition&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Gene Smith (@gsmith) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/gsmith/status/213325584921665537" data-datetime="2012-06-14T17:42:37+00:00"&gt;June 14, 2012&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within all of us there are two minds: the professional and the employee.  Actually, there are probably many more but I am just going to talk about those two. On the one side, the professional is focused on his/her craft and building skills.  Professionals are passionate about their discipline and look for ways to be creative and innovative.  The professional seeks challenge and isn't afraid of failure.  The employee side, however, is focused on his/her job as it has been defined: meeting expectations, following the rules, and other forms of job preservation/advancement.  The employee side seeks comfort and safety. The employee avoids risk through routine. Innovation is limited to small optimizations of the status quo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both sides are important. You get dependability from the employee.  You get excellence from the professional.  Depending on the field, one aspect may dominate another. For example, in an unskilled field, the employee dominates the professional.  The job is easy to learn, there is no career to build, and you are easily replaced. You show up on time, you do as you are told, and you go home. The best you can do is show yourself to be dependable and hope for a promotion to lead others in the tasks that you have learned. In a high skill job, like a doctor, the employee part is minimal.  You see a lot of passion about the craft and much less interest in the details of employment. Doctors can easily shift from one practice to another but the focus is the same - solving challenging problems, contributing to the field of medicine, and delivering excellent patient care.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why am I even talking about this esoteric decomposition of the human psyche? Because it has profound implications on knowledge management and Intranets. The thing is that advanced skill and knowledge are wrapped up in the professional side of the person and that side wants to interact with his/her field (inside and outside the company). It is far more rewarding to share brilliant insight on a large professional network than to a small group of co-workers. The few co-workers that are as passionate as the professional are probably already on that external professional network too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is why the knowledge management aspect of intranets (like blogging and micro-blogging and most wikis) tend to fail so often. The dream of using an Intranet as a catalyst to synthesize all of the great ideas trapped in the brains of an organization never is achieved. The professional's brilliance is drawn to a larger stage.  The most successful bits of Intranet are the ones that serve the employee: the company directory, forms, and templates. Templates are the things that are most often passed off as knowledge but I would contend that they are more focused on routine and consistency than thinking and knowledge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is why I have such low expectations for the "Social Enterprise" solving knowledge management through tools like Yammer that emulate what is happening on the public web. The single reason for Twitter's success is its openness. With an open network like Twitter (or Google+), I can connect with a stranger on the other side of the world through the simple bond of being interested in the same thing. We can learn from each other and build off each others' ideas. Our motivation is our interest &amp;mdash; the professionals within each of us.  If you narrow down that pool to just the people you work with (a great percentage of whom are involved in totally different professions), the shared interests get fewer and much more mundane: holiday schedules, cafeteria menus, etc. This makes the value of content shared  hardly worth the cost and effort of implementing these tools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the Social Enterprise is to work, I predict it will be on open networks that can also support private group channels. Personally, the network that I think comes the closest is Google+. Perhaps LinkedIn. I guess Facebook has the functionality but Facebook has become a place for the hyper-personal and that clashes too much with our professional contexts. I would love to hear about companies that are using public networks to connect employees. Perhaps this would be putting your social network links in your corporate directory profile or creating circles and lists for co-workers. Anyone doing anything cool? I ask this question to the professional in you.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>A test framework added to core of Drupal 7</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://buytaert.net/a-test-framework-in-drupal-7"&gt;Dries reports&lt;/a&gt; on a &lt;a href="http://drupal.org/testing-sprint"&gt;2 day sprint in Paris&lt;/a&gt; where they added a test framework into the Drupal 7 core.  Drupal leadership is stressing automated testing for two main reasons: automated testing will allow the developer community to efficiently scale and will allow more development to occur in a release cycle.  The idea behind the former, is that automated testing can remove the some of the manual overhead from the committer and help maintain quality as more contributors submit code.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the latter, today code freeze happens less than half way through the release cycle.  Drupal 6 was developed for 5 months and was in code freeze to fix bugs for 7.  By shortening the code freeze period, Drupal can either release more often or get more functionality into each release.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It remains to be seen how actively the rank and file Drupal development community (especially the module developers) will embrace the test framework.  Historically, Drupal has had a fast and loose development style that has been both productive and chaotic.  Dries' passion around the subject and the presence of &lt;a href="http://acquia.com/"&gt;Acquia&lt;/a&gt; will certainly help but only time will tell.</content>

    <title>TYPO3 V4 Released</title>
    <content type='html'>TYPO3's much anticipated Version 4 was recently released.  In the words of project leader Kasper Skarhoj:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Version 4.0 represents a milestone in the development of TYPO3 that we have been working toward for a long time. It supports qualitatively superior enterprise modules. The introduction of the the long awaited versioning feature is not to be forgotten. With the management framework for versioning that we call â€˜workspacesâ€™, versioning will be brought to the userâ€™s desktop. And that brings a transparency which even surpassed my own expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stay tuned for a review.  I am looking forward to giving it a test drive.</content>

    <title>Contributing GPL Licensed Code Back</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Recently, I have come across a number of articles that made the point that you need to be careful of using GPL licensed code because you may &lt;i&gt;have&lt;/i&gt; to contribute back your improvements.  I wanted to clarify this assertion because, in most cases, it is simply not true.  Still, even if you are not required to contribute back improvements to GPL licensed code, it may be in your best interest to do so but I will get to that later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First a little on the &lt;a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html"&gt;GPL&lt;/a&gt;.  The GPL, a.k.a. the GNU General Public License, is a product of the Free Software Foundation and it is considered the most restrictive of the many &lt;a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/"&gt;OSI Certified&lt;/a&gt; open source licenses.  Many great open software applications including the Linux Kernel, are licensed under the GPL.  Unlike some of the more laissez faire licenses, such as the &lt;a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php"&gt;BSD License&lt;/a&gt;, the GPL has a "viral clause" that says derivative works must be distributed under the same terms as the source work.  So code based on GPL licensed code is GPL licensed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although this sounds scary, the "viral clause" is only triggered when the derivative work is distributed - as in sold or shared among a select group of entities.  So if you extend Zope to add a new capability for your organization, and never share the code with anyone, you do not need to publish your improvement under the GPL rules.  The trick is knowing what is considered distribution.  Philip Albert wrote a great &lt;a href="http://www.linuxinsider.com/story/38728.html"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="http://www.linuxinsider.com"&gt;Linux Insider&lt;/a&gt; on this subject.  Albert writes that sharing across certain corporate relationships, such as between subsidiaries or between a system's integrator and client, could be considered distribution.  If you are working with a system's integrator on GPL code, you should be careful to structure the relationship as "work for hire."  Otherwise, if you sharing the code with your consultants could be considered distribution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another factor is whether your code is a derived work or is considered a module or application that uses the GPL licensed application.  Plugins and things of that nature are not considered derived work.  In fact, software is often open sourced for the reason of expanding a market for non-open source software uses it.  For example, SAP open sourced their database to make the value of ERP less about the database than the application sitting on top of the database.  The Firefox browser phenomena is so interesting because it has the potential to create a market of extensions that work on the freely available browser.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have talked about why you may not &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;have to&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; contribute back your improvements to GPL licensed code.  Now, lets discuss why you may &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;want to&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; contribute back your improvements.  You contribute code back when the competitive advantage of sole access is outweighed by the cost of maintaining it.  When you contribute back, great things can happen.  The code gets reviewed by really good programmers.  The code becomes part of the core application so that you have less to worry about it when you upgrade.  The contribution that you make also has the potential to grow into a new feature that would be useful to you.  The application gets better  and attracts more users which ensures its future.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much has been written about strategies for using and contributing to open source.  One of the more powerful models is Geoffrey Moore's distinction between "Core" and "Context" which he &lt;a href="http://itconversations.com/shows/detail494.html"&gt;presented&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="http://www.osbc2004.com/live/13/events/13SFO05A"&gt;OSBC 2005 in San Francisco&lt;/a&gt;.  I have also found my colleague &lt;a href="http://stephesblog.blogs.com/my_weblog/"&gt;Stephe Walli's&lt;/a&gt; 2005 USENIX presentation &lt;a href="http://www.optaros.com/pdf/USENIX-OSSBusiness.pdf"&gt;Under the Hood: Open Source Business Models in Context&lt;/a&gt; to be helpful in understanding the benefits of using and contributing back to open source.  The general gist behind these models is that a company has certain capabilities that give it a competitive advantage (Core) and a whole lot of other capabilities that it needs to keep the lights on or make the core stuff work (Context).  That is not to say that the context stuff is not important.  Companies need to pay their employees but having the best payroll system is not going to make one company a market leader.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back to the world of content management. There are many content management features that are always context (storage) and many features that are frequently context (workflow) and occasionally there will be some features that are core (such as, perhaps, views of content that give new insight or knowledge).  But, of course, it is the content that resides in the system which is really core to the company.  Based on this breakdown, content management has high potential to attract cooperation and contributions from organizations that want solid systems and are not threatened by the prospect of their competitor having the same core capabilities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Progress for Plone</title>
    <content type='html'>Donna "Snow Write" Snow has an update on the &lt;a href="http://snowwrites.com/2008/05/25/the-summit-aftermath-psps/"&gt;Aftermath&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="http://www.openplans.org/projects/plone-strategic-planning/project-home"&gt;2008 Plone Strategic Planning Summit&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://blog.contenthere.net/2008/02/plone-strategic-planning-session.html"&gt;my notes from the event&lt;/a&gt;).  Donna is an early user and (one could say) matriarch of the Plone community (her analogy of Plone as a teenager certainly strengthens the case there).  I like her description of &lt;a href="http://weblion.psu.edu/blog/esteele/gloworm-0-1-alpha1-now-available/view"&gt;GloWorm&lt;/a&gt; and other tools to soften the adjustment to Plone's new &lt;a href="http://www.zope.org/Products/Zope3"&gt;Zope 3&lt;/a&gt; oriented architecture.</content>

    <title>The Website is Launched, the Journey Begins</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;We have all been there.  We launch a new website and, interspersed with general praise and appreciation, there are some hysterical complaints about trivial things like a word-wrap or a punctuation mark.  The tone on these emails is similar to someone who just received their huge wedding invitation order and saw that their name was misspelled.  They are mad and want immediate resolution to avoid mortal embarrassment on their special day.  Ironically, it doesn't seem to matter that the old website was a total disaster.  This site is new.  It should be perfect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are on the receiving end of one of these complaints, you know how easy the issue is to fix.  You know it is nothing like re-printing 500 wedding invitations with gold leaf on expensive paper.  You just edit the content in your CMS and republish. In fact, you fixed the problem in the two minutes that elapsed between receiving the urgent-flagged email and the frantic follow-up call.  You also know that the content that is the target of the complaint has a shelf life of only a couple of days.  In fact, you consider the entire website to be dynamic and constantly evolving.  What you launched was not a bunch of static pages but new layouts, branding, and infrastructure &lt;em&gt;to support your dynamic digital marketing program&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In retrospect, it is easy to see where the disconnect started.  The internal audience for the site had not seen anything since they fell in love with the mockups.  And the mockups were perfect &amp;mdash; artificially perfect.  The designer put in just enough text to make the layout look full, but not crowded.  The PDFs that were distributed didn't depend on a specific screen resolution or browser.   The audience was expecting to see those polished PDFs sitting in their browser on launch day; but what they got wasn't exactly the same.  Add that to the fact that the web team appeared to vanish after the last site was launched and their anxiety is understandable.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do we correct this?  The number one thing you need to do is keep up the pace.  You can't take a break after the new site is launched because that leaves the impression that the site is "complete."  You know that launch day marks the beginning of a new phase of your digital marketing program, but if you act like you think your are done, you are bound to get into discussions with people trying to prove to you that you are not.  The conversation invariably focuses on the site being "defective" rather than what it really is: a work in progress.  Keep the site changing and be transparent with your road map.  Regularly communicate with people who have ideas and update them on your progress.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, justify your decisions with data. When you relaunch a site, people will often look for their old content to make sure it is still there. If you removed it or re-organized their content, be prepared to explain why. The traffic was low, the content was redundant, the page was competing with more important pages on search results… these are all good reasons to retire a page. The fact that you can respond in this way shows that you are still engaged and moving forward in a thoughtful way. This will further re-enforce the idea that this is a journey and you are a competent and attentive driver.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depending on your organization's culture and history, breaking out of a "print-final website" mindset might be easy or hard.  Generally, the more web savvy your internal audience is, the easier it will be to change people's minds.  The older guard will be more difficult to convince.  Your line of reasoning should go like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Remember how perfect the last website seemed at launch?  Well, it only seemed perfect because it was rigid.  The designers got it just right and then locked it down through QA. But it was also brittle and it started to crumble from the moment we started to change content.  New browser versions and platforms only hastened its decay.  This new website is part of a program that involves continuous improvement.  It will improve, rather than degrade, over time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key is to sell internal stakeholders on the idea that your website is a constantly evolving asset that will never be perfect but will be always be good (or even great).  The site will adapt to changing organizational goals and audience expectations. Like the original meaning of the term "launch," putting up a new website should be considered the beginning of a journey, not the end of a project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2010/06/jeff-cram-your-website-is-not-a-project.html"&gt;Your Website is not a Project&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Wired but unstrung</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I am sitting on the plane on the way back from a wonderful time at &lt;a href="http://cmf2007.dk"&gt;CMF2007&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/cmf2007/"&gt;pics&lt;/a&gt;) in Aarhus. Thanks to Janus, Sara, Flemming (my guardian angel), and the rest of the J. Boye crew for putting together a fantastic conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before taking the trip, I made some changes to my computing toolkit to help me be more productive in the air. For those who don't know me, I am a proponent of server side tools for managing information. I use services like &lt;a href="http://www.bloglines.com/"&gt;Bloglines&lt;/a&gt; for reading blogs, Wikis and Google Notebook/Docs for writing, and &lt;a href="http://del.icio.us"&gt;del.icio.us&lt;/a&gt; for bookmarks. Ideally I should be able to log onto any computer, connect to the Internet, and have everything I need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first change that I made was to migrate from my beloved Bloglines to &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/reader/view/"&gt;Google Reader.&lt;/a&gt; While, I prefer the functionality and behavior of Bloglines to Reader, the addition of &lt;a href="http://gears.google.com/"&gt;Google Gears&lt;/a&gt; makes Reader a perfect online/offline tool. I can still access my feeds from any computer but I can take my little slice of the web with me when I am offline. According to &lt;a href="http://www.feedburner.com"&gt;feedburner,&lt;/a&gt; my immigration appears to be on the tail end of a trend. The Reader wedge of the subscriber pie chart grows in proportion to Blogline's decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also installed the blogging client &lt;a href="http://infinite-sushi.com/software/ecto/"&gt;Ecto&lt;/a&gt;, which I am finding preferable to the &lt;a href="http://www.blogger.com"&gt;Blogger&lt;/a&gt; web client because it adds little touches that are difficult to reliably support in a cross-browser web client. If it were not for packed airplanes with coach seats that are too small to work in, wasted time in the air would be a perfect place to catch up on writing blogs. From a business class seat, or at least Economy Plus, Ecto would be even better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;And with that, I will dig my laptop out of my chest, power down, and watch the in-flight movie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content>

    <title>My tack hammer is about to get just a little bit better</title>
    <content type='html'>Zak Greant wrote in his blog: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is interesting to note that Seth, despite being a CMS wizard (or perhaps, because of), uses Blogger for his blog. No point in using a 10-ton pneumatic press when a tackhammer (that someone else cleans and polishes) will do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't know about being a wizard, but going with Blogger was somewhat intentional and calculated.  I had gotten up the initiative to start a blog and I didn't want an excuse of fiddling with technology to stand in the way of actually writing.  As you can probably tell, I didn't spend a lot of time on the name either.  Since making that choice, there were times when I was happy with the decision (like when my friend's self hosted blog was down half the time due to a broken fan in his server), and times when I wished for more than Blogger was able to give.  Having a cutting edge blog platform was never enough of a priority for me to invest in an alternative and migrating.  So I decided to wait for really nice to have features like categories.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, the wait (at least for categories) is about to be over.  I just noticed that new Blogger version currently in beta will support tagged categories.  There are a bunch of other features that I don't really care about but categories are going to be great.  Of course, it is going to take me a little while to upgrade - priorities and all ;)</content>

    <title>Another clue about Oracle&amp;#39;s attitude toward Web Content Management</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;By now most industry analysts have grown skeptical of &lt;a href="http://www.oracle.com"&gt;Oracle's&lt;/a&gt; commitment to web content management (WCM).  Those analysts that are still in denial are either too focused on the document management side of enterprise content management (ECM) to even care or they are on Oracle's payroll.  The writing has been on the wall for a while now.  Before Oracle bought it, Stellent had (in my opinion) the best WCM functionality of any of the document-oriented ECM products.  They were miles ahead of EMC/Documentum and IBM/FileNet.  Stellent was even edging past traditional WCM products like Vignette and Interwoven who were neglecting WCM to concentrate on their ECM offering.  The Stellent acquisition happened right before the release of a new version that introduced big WCM improvements.  After the acquisition, Stellent got dumped into the "Fusion Middleware" (AKA "Neither Database nor ERP") division which was a clear sign that Oracle didn't want to spend too much time understanding what it bought.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason why Oracle bought Stellent is pretty clear.  For readers who are not CMS historians, many years ago Stellent bought a company called "Inso" which developed the filters that could convert documents into different formats.  Microsoft has Inso to thank for breaking WordPerfect's and Lotus 123's holds on their respective markets.  Because of OEM'ed Inso technology, an MS Word user could open a WordPerfect document.  Stellent used the acquired Inso technology to lead the market in word-processing-to-web functionality.  More than with any other ECM product, a Stellent UCM user could realistically use MS Word to maintain a structured web asset.  Oracle's plan for Stellent was to use those filters to help its document repository story.  At the time, Oracle was pitching its "ECM-light" vision that positioned its database as a step up from a file system for storing documents.  The database could store metadata and provided a search interface that could list documents in different ways.  Inso filters helped parse documents for better indexing and also introduced a capability for exporting into different formats.  Plus the Stellent user interface was a big improvement over anything that Oracle could cook up (no, knowledge workers do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; want to work in SQLPlus).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wow, that was some rant.  But why I am talking about that now?  Well, I was just listening to an &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/rss/podcast/podcast_detail.php?siteId=4985907"&gt;NPR Environment podcast&lt;/a&gt; that was underwritten by Oracle (thanks Oracle, BTW).  When reading the Oracle underwriter statement, the presenter instructed listeners to "visit &lt;a href="http://www.oracle.com/ironman2"&gt;www.oracle.com/&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;ironman2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to learn more."  Now we all know that Oracle is a big company and are probably too busy to create marketing landing pages for all of their different advertising campaigns (no matter how easy it is to do).  You can make the old "cobbler's son" excuse.  But in this era where the premium WCM vendors are selling on "interactive marketing" and "engagement" functionality wouldn't you think that Oracle would make an effort?  Wouldn't it be helpful to know whether traffic was coming from an NPR or Iron Man 2 advertising spot?  Ironically, I seem to remember A/B testing, marketing landing pages, and reporting functionality were all part of that mid-acquisition Stellent version.  Apparently the Oracle marketing team seems not to have discovered it.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Alfresco plans to open up</title>
    <content type='html'>Jeff Potts has an &lt;a href="http://ecmarchitect.com/archives/2008/03/13/816"&gt;update&lt;/a&gt; to his cogent post on &lt;a href="http://ecmarchitect.com/archives/2008/03/08/813"&gt;Alfresco's insularity&lt;/a&gt;.  According to Jeff, John Newton and Kevin Cochrane promised to create a system that would allow non-Alfresco employees to contribute to the Alfresco code base.  The changes are expected when Alfresco releases 3.0 of the Enterprise Edition.  At this time, the Community Edition (which Alfresco treats as a "lab" for introducing new, unsupported features) may start to accept contributions from non-Alfrescans.  The prospect of committer status is unsure.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What makes this a big deal is that Alfresco has always hobbled the Community Edition to drive sales to the Enterprise Edition. First, they stripped down the Community Edition.  For a while they made it badgeware.  Most recently, Alfresco's policy has been to forbid integration partners from helping Community Edition users.  Because Alfresco doesn't fix the bugs in the Community Edition and Alfresco partners will not help you implement and maintain it, the Community Edition is too risky to use for most companies to consider.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Opening up Alfresco Community Edition would allow a community to form around the project that may make it more viable to use in the same way that companies use &lt;a href="http://fedoraproject.org/"&gt;Fedora Core&lt;/a&gt; as a lower cost alternative to &lt;a href="http://www.redhat.com/"&gt;Red Hat Linux&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the open source content management world, &lt;a href="http://www.magnolia.info/en/magnolia.html"&gt;Magnolia&lt;/a&gt; is a good example of a commercial open source company that has non-employee committers on their Community Edition.  The Magnolia Community Edition serves as the core on which the Enterprise Edition is built. In order to get support, you need to buy the Enterprise Edition whether or not you intend to use its value added features (&lt;a href="http://magnolia.info/en/products/enterprise-edition/sitedesigner.html"&gt;Sitedesigner&lt;/a&gt;, clustering, etc.).  Other commercial open source projects like &lt;a href="http://www.hippocms.org"&gt;Hippo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://cocoondev.org/daisy/index.html"&gt;Daisy&lt;/a&gt; have one open source licensed product and make all their revenue on support and training contracts which are entirely optional for companies that adopt their software.  However, Magnolia, Hippo and Daisy are small and not so heavily venture funded, so they have less pressure to convert adopters into paying customers.&lt;br /&gt;</content>

    <title>Are content managers ready for personalization?</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I have been catching up on product demos recently and have seen some really elegant functionality for marketers.   Several products have introduced modules that allow CMS users to plan, implement, and measure multivariate testing, search engine optimization, and personalization without the continued support of a developer.  A developer has to put the tools in place but, after that, the CMS user can fully control the behavior of the site and optimize its business  impact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is easy to get excited by this functionality.  But then you think of the difficulty your average organization has with even the basic aspects of content production and you wonder if they ready for these tools.  How can you do an A/B test if getting someone to write option "A" is a struggle and option "B" would be a miracle?  Of course, not all companies suffer from these issues.  The more sophisticated publishers and eCommerce companies have been doing these advanced site management activities even when the technology stood in their way, much less facilitated them.  But your average marketing site is still in the dark ages when it comes to managing content.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will your average marketing group be able to leverage this functionality? Or will it be yet another unused feature that clutters the user interface?  My hope is that once contributors and site managers start to experiment and see results, they will rapidly evolve to be more committed and proactive in the same way social media participants started to embrace tagging when they saw their work start to surface in more prominent places.  A tight and accurate feedback loop is important in any learning process so maybe access to testing and metrics has been the missing feature rather than usability-oriented functionality like in-context editing.  It is probably more effective to make a task interesting and rewarding than to make that uninteresting work easier to do.  The former strategy will cause a user to overcome any obstacle he is faced with.  In the latter strategy, there will always be some excuse not to do the work.  I touched on this idea in an earlier post called &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2009/06/what-your-intranet-needs-is-a-publisher.html"&gt;"What your intranet needs is a publisher!"&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is not to say that all you need to do is drop in personalization functionality one day and your organization will immediately change.  I have seen many organizations fail with this approach because they didn't have the content to support it.  I saw a slide from a &lt;a href="http://www.sitecore.net/"&gt;Sitecore&lt;/a&gt; (below, click for a larger image) demonstration that shows a gradual maturity process that begins with understanding your users and your content and ending with real time personalization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://media.contenthere.net.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/blgimages/sitecore-personalization-maturity-path.png" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://media.contenthere.net.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/blgimages/sitecore-personalization-maturity-path_small.png" alt="Sitecore's model for incremental success in content personalization"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I very much agree with the model but I think that the trick to success is being able to see real results at every step of the way.  Most organizations will not have the commitment to sustain a continuous effort through long periods of no results.  Results are easy to felt from the conversion tracking step onward.  Getting to that point, however, will require organizations to aggressively push through traffic analysis, experience analysis, and content profiling.  Perhaps there is room to get some intermediate outcomes along the way that can keep an organization hungry for more.  These outcomes can't just be in the form of a spreadsheet that is out of date by the time that it is presented.  There needs to be some tangible business impact like being able to make a small change to the website that yields some measurable result.  If this is not possible, the best one can do is time-box this period of no feedback and have faith that the results will be worth that fixed investment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are just coming on the market now but I am really looking forward to seeing the organizational response to these marketing tools.  The early adopters will certainly benefit from the functionality because, by being early adopters, they have already shown their commitment to improvement.  It will be really interesting to see examples of this functionality transforming mainstream organizations that have struggled in the past.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Alfresco and Plone</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;[Note (2/27/2008):  Alfresco has improved its web content management capabilities quite a bit since I wrote this post.  For a more up to date assessment, check out &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/reports/alfrescowcm.html"&gt;my more recent review of Alfresco&lt;/a&gt; that covers version 2.2]&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.alfrescosoftware.com/"&gt;Alfresco Software&lt;/a&gt; frequently describes &lt;a href="http://www.alfresco.org/"&gt;Alfresco&lt;/a&gt; as the first open source Enterprise Content Management (ECM) System. To the extent that they are the first well funded open source project to aggressively invade the territory of industry incumbents like &lt;a href="http://www.documentum.com/"&gt;Documentum&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.filenet.com/"&gt;FileNet&lt;/a&gt;, that is true. However, they are not the first open source project with document management capabilities. While there are a couple of other open source CMS that are designed to do document management (&lt;a href="http://contineo.sourceforge.net/"&gt;Contineo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.xinco.org/"&gt;Xinco&lt;/a&gt;), that part of the open source CMS landscape has been dominated by &lt;a href="http://plone.org/"&gt;Plone&lt;/a&gt;.  What follows is a short analysis of the relative positioning of the two projects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recently went to training for Alfresco and really like the software. I was amazed by what the team has done in such a short period of time. The Alfresco team had benefit of being able to rapidly "assemble" their application using best of breed open source components. Equally important, the lessons learned at Documentum (the development team is largely composed from Documentum alum. In fact, A lead Alfresco developer was employee of the year at his last year at Documentum) seem to have been applied to the design of Alfresco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A particularly compelling aspect of Alfresco is the openness of the architecture.  Alfresco supports Microsoft's &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/mind/1196/cifs.asp"&gt;CIFS (Common Internet File System)&lt;/a&gt; protocol that allows you to mount the repository, or a sub-folder of the repository, as a Microsoft Windows Network File Share. Doing so makes it possible for users to unconsciously interact with the CMS by working in their natural ways. Content rules, that are triggered when files are moved in and out of folders, can execute functions like add metadata, start workflow, or send emails behind the scenes. Making the CMS "invisible" like this is a very good way to help ensure adoption. Alfresco also supports &lt;a href="http://www.webdav.org/"&gt;WebDAV&lt;/a&gt;, is &lt;a href="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=170"&gt;JSR 170&lt;/a&gt; level 1 compliant (level 1 is the watered down, read-only version of the spec which is still useful in integration with other applications), and has a Web Services interface. Support of these standards makes Alfresco very attractive in distributed, heterogeneous architectures which is where I think content management is going. It is a nice departure from the mainstream ECM vision of centralization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inside, the application is highly configurable. One interesting feature is the application of the concept of "aspects." If you are a Java programmer, you probably have heard the buzz of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect-oriented_programming"&gt;Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP)&lt;/a&gt;. The general idea is that an "Aspect" is a general set of attributes or capabilities that can be assigned to an object without relying on inheritance through the class hierarchy. For some reason, it was easier for me to get my head around applying aspects to content assets than it was for me to figure out AOP. In Alfresco, there are "aspects" like "versionable" or "categorized." This concepts allow content types to be very simple and, if they desire, &lt;i&gt;users can&lt;/i&gt; add attributes to a single instance of a content asset. Defining content types and aspects, along with almost all configuration is done by editing XML configuration files. I think it was smart not to build a sophisticated configuration user interface at this stage of the project. The people that you want to make these customizations should be comfortable editing XML files.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on their experience of most clients wanting very basic workflow, Alfresco's workflow model is very simplistic. Workflows are designed using folders to represent states and then using rules to add simple approve/reject choices that can trigger other events. This system would be a little awkward for implementing complex workflows that involve splits and merges and syncronization with other approvals. Alfresco plans to add &lt;a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=wsbpel"&gt;BPEL&lt;/a&gt; support will address this in later releases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As mentioned earlier, versioning has been implemented as an aspect so that any content type may be versioned. One small quirk with versioning is that, when you use the CIFS interface, and you editing the file directly, a new version is created, which creates a full copy of the file on the file system, with every save. This would pose a problem of consuming a lot of disk space if you were editing a large video file and you want to save frequently to prevent data loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alfresco handles all types of file types but support for Microsoft Office and PDF formats is the strongest.  Using &lt;a href="http://www.openoffice.org/"&gt;OpenOffice&lt;/a&gt; components, Alfresco is able to extract text for the full text search index (powered by &lt;a href="http://lucene.apache.org/"&gt;Lucene&lt;/a&gt;) and transform into PDF format. The system is architected to be extended with new "transformers" that can handle other conversions. I have already talked to clients that would want to extend Alfresco in this way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, is Alfresco the perfect open source ECM? Not quite. At least not yet. First of all, Alfresco is not all open source. Features like group based access control and clustering are actually "Shared Source" and require monthly &lt;a href="http://www.alfrescosoftware.com/products/"&gt;subsription fees&lt;/a&gt; to use. Without these features, it would be difficult to roll Alfresco out to a large group of users. So you could say that the "E" part of the "ECM" is not open source. The second issue is that, at this point, Alfresco does not handle web content, another critical part of the classic ECM definition. This was intentional. The Alfresco team wanted to start with a solid foundation and then grow into other aspects of content management. The demand for affordable document management solutions, and the scarcity of open source projects that do it, make this a wise choice. I actually don't mind the absence of WCM functionality. CMS that try to do too much are often difficult to use and it would be better to get it right than throw it in sloppily. Alfresco says it is going to add WCM later and that team that they have assembled to do it understands WCM. I hope, from their experience at Documentum, they learned the lesson that WCM is not just a matter of managing another type of files.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So how does Alfresco stack up to Plone? There is a large degree of functional overlap between Plone and Alfresco. They both have the functionality necessary for groups of users to manage and share documents: access control, search, metadata, etc. Plone also supports WebDAV and has a mechanism where files automatically updated on the server when edited with a client application such as Microsoft Word. But it does not support CIFS. Alfresco has the advantage of a content rules framework which Plone is missing because of its lack of an event model. Alfresco has a better content versioning system. The many companies who have standardized on Java will feel more comfortable working with a Java solution (although their standard application servers may not run Java 1.5, which is required by Alfresco - WebSphere does not). Also, Alfresco, with its open architecture, has more options for integration than Zope based applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are several areas where Plone has a significant edge. The most notable of which is handling web content. Plone is an effective and eleg&lt;br/&gt;ant hybrid of a document management system and a web content management system. Plone's workflow model is more robust than Alfresco's. The other significant advantage that Plone has is its maturity which has lead to a broad install base, excellent documentation (including several professionally published books), and an extensive library of add-on extensions which provide capabilities ranging from a blog to eCommerce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on all this, I think both applications have their uses. I would use Alfresco for a targeted document management solution that would fit into a larger enterprise content management architecture - perhaps as a node, or collection of nodes, in a deployment like the one described in &lt;a href="http://www.kmworld.com/kmw05/Presentations/D201_Wissink.pps"&gt;this presentation&lt;/a&gt; which Travis Wissinks gave at the &lt;a href="http://www.kmworld.com/kmw05/"&gt;KMWorld &amp;amp; Intranets&lt;/a&gt; conference last month. I would use Plone to build an all-in-one intranet or extranet where I wanted to mix article, page, and file content and opportunistically deploy new features to improve collaboration and retention. I would also use Plone as a department-level knowledge management system because of features like threaded discussions around content assets, event calendar, and native RSS support.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Seth Gottlieb, eZ</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Last week, I attended &lt;a href="http://ez.no/products/ez_publish"&gt;eZ publish&lt;/a&gt; developer training and got certified as an eZ publish developer:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://ez.no/certification/verify/146570"&gt;&lt;img src="http://ez.no/var/storage/ezcertdev.png" alt="eZ publish certified developer" style="border: 0px none ; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The class was largely composed of experienced eZ developers so we were able to breeze through the content management and eZ publish basics and fill the holes in our self taught knowledge (small inside joke, the instructor's name is Kristian Hole).  I will be updating the eZ publish review from the CM Problems white paper with my new knowledge and post it here as a derivative work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for now, a couple initial observations:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;eZ is making a big push into the North American market.  They set up an office in Vancouver and staffed it with some pretty senior people.  Their new sales manager, David Dempsey is tireless in his efforts to reach out to systems integration partners. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the next couple of releases, there is going to be more convergence between eZ publish and &lt;a href="http://ez.no/products/ez_components"&gt;eZ components&lt;/a&gt;.  When eZ publish is PHP 5 compatible, eZ publish will use eZ components for templating and other services.  This will have several benefits.  Among them: there will be more developers familiar with this architecture and there will be more people testing these core components.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;eZ publish is being used by some pretty high traffic websites.  Some of the students in the class had impressive high performance, high availability eZ deployments.  Still, running a development environment on the Fedora Core workstations provided was pretty slow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Send me an email if you want some eZ publish help before I forget all this stuff!&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>CMS Architecture: Managing Content Type Configurations</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Warning: this post is highly technical.  Non-programmers, please avert your eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://gadgetopia.com/"&gt;Deane Barker&lt;/a&gt; (from &lt;a href="http://blendinteractive.com/"&gt;Blend Interactive&lt;/a&gt;) and I have a running conversation about CMS architectures.  One of the recurring topics is how content models and other configuration is managed.  There are two high-level approaches: inside the repository and outside the repository.  Both have their advantages and disadvantages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Managing content types outside the repository&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;My preferred approach is to manage content type definitions in files that can be maintained in a source code management system.  This way you can replicate a content type definition to different environments without moving the content.  Developers can keep up to date with changes made by their colleagues.  &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2009/07/code-moves-forward-content-moves-backward.html"&gt;Configuration can be tested on Development and QA before moving to production.&lt;/a&gt;  There is no user-interface to get in the way.  No repetitive configuration tasks.  Everything is scriptable and can be automated.  I especially like it when content types are actual code classes so you can add helper methods in addition to traditional fields.  Of course, when you get into this, it is a slippery slope into a tightly coupled display tier that can execute that logic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the downside, it is often difficult to de-couple the content (which sits in the repository) from the content model (which defines the repository).  When you push an updated content type to a site instance, you might need to change how the content is stored in the repository.  This is more problematic in repositories that store content attributes as columns in a database.  It is less of a problem in repositories that use XML or object databases (or name-value pairs in a relational database) where content from two different versions of the same model can coexist more easily.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you do manage content type definitions outside of the repository, a good pattern to follow is &lt;a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/migrations.html"&gt;data migrations, which was made popular by Ruby on Rails.&lt;/a&gt;  I am using a similar &lt;a href="http://south.aeracode.org/"&gt;migration framework for Django called South&lt;/a&gt;.  Basically, each migration is a little program that has two methods: forward and back ("up" and "down" in RoR. "Forwards" and "backwards" in South) that can add, remove, and alter columns and also move data around.  The forward updates the database, the backward reverts to the earlier version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Managing content types within the repository&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most CMSs follow the approach of managing the content type definitions inside the repository and provide an administrative interface to create and edit content types.  This is really convenient when you have one instance of the application and you want to do something like add a new field.  There is no syntax to know and application validation can stop you from doing anything stupid.  Some CMSs allow you to version content type definitions so that you can revert an upgrade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you have multiple instances of your site, managing content types can be tedious and error prone if you need to go through the administrative interface of each instance and repeat your work.  Of course, you can't copy the entire repository from one instance unless you want to overwrite your content.  If your CMS is designed in this way, you should look for a packaging system that allows you to export a content definition (and other configurations) so that it can be deployed to another instance.  Many CMSs allow an instance to push a package directly over to another instance.  The packaging system may also do some data manipulation (like setting a default value for a required new field).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unless you are building your own custom CMS, this all may seem like an academic question.  It really is quite philosophical: is configuration &lt;em&gt;content that is managed inside the application&lt;/em&gt; or does it need to be managed &lt;em&gt;as part of the application&lt;/em&gt;.  The same thing goes for presentation templates (but that is another blog post).  However,  if you intend to select a CMS (like most people should), it is important to understand the choice that the CMS developers made and how they work around the limitations of their choice.  If you are watching a demo, and you see the sales engineer smartly adding fields through a UI, you should ask if this is the only way to update the content model and if you can push a content type definition from one instance to another.  If the sales engineer is working in a code editor, you need to ask how the content is updated when a model update is deployed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Open Source FAQ for my Mother and other Non-Digerati</title>
    <content type='html'>Since we announced &lt;a href="http://www.optaros.com/"&gt;Optaros&lt;/a&gt; a lot of friends and family have been asking for an explanation of Open Source. In the spirit of re-use, I thought I would publish some of my answers to typical questions. If you are reading this Blog, you may know all this stuff, but you also might be asked similar questions so feel free to send your friends this way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is Open Source?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Open Source is a licensing model for software where the software and the source code are distributed without requiring licensing fees. There are a number of Open Source software licenses that have different stipulations. The &lt;a href="http://perens.com/OSD.html"&gt;Open Source Definition&lt;/a&gt;, written by &lt;a href="http://perens.com/"&gt;Bruce Perens&lt;/a&gt;, contains 10 tests to determine whether a software license can qualify as Open Source. Open Source used to be called Free Software (and it still is by some &lt;a href="http://www.gnu.org/"&gt;people&lt;/a&gt;). The name Open Source was adoped because "Free" had a connotation of being worthless, rather than its intended meaning of Freedom as in Liberty. The concept of Free Software has been around for a &lt;a href="http://www.netaction.org/opensrc/future/"&gt;very long time&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;You mean like Linux?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Linux has been getting a lot of media attention but there are thousands of software applications distributed as Open Source. Today, Open Source Software is mostly used in infrastructure (operating systems such as Linux, web servers that serve web pages, databases) and sub-components of software, but a growing number of Open Source Software is software that non-programmers can use both at work (such as accounting systems, spreadsheets, word processing applications and publishing systems) and home (such as web browsers, Instant Message clients, and games).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Who writes Open Source Software?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the stereotype of an introverted high-shool student programming in his pajamas is a colorful image, it is inaccurate. Most Open Source programmers are paid to code by either software companies such as IBM and Oracle that have Open Source contributors on staff, or consultants and internal technical staff who use Open Source Software and contribute back improvements they make when working for their employer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why do people give away things for free?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of Open Source software started out as commercial software and was opened as a competitive business strategy to increase support and services revenues by increased market share. Even proprietary software is given away for free for these same reasons but those deals are kept secret. Proprietary software companies will underwrite Open Source projects to lower the overall price by making infrastructure that their software runs on free (for example, SAP open sourced a database to make SAP cheaper for their clients to run. This also took revenue away from their competitor: Oracle who sells databases). As for the individual contributors, different people do it for different reasons. Some contribute because any contribution back to the community will be further improved upon and those improvements will be available to the original author. Others contribute because Open Source is the best way to expose their talent.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Is Open Source Software any good?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Open Source is just a licensing model. The quality of the software is up to the developers. Consequently, there is some very good Open Source Software and some very bad Open Source Software. Nevertheless, the Open Source model enables processes and attracts individuals that are capable of rapidly creating very high quality software. The key here is that everything is open. People that are qualified and inspired can contribute, and the results of their efforts are visible for everyone to see. On the second point, people generally step up when their code is open for criticism (and oh yeah, the Open Source community can be very critical) in the same way that restaurants keep their kitchens cleaner if their patrons can see in. Closed software, on the other hand, is a little like sausages - you may not want to know what's inside. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;What stops some unqualified or nefarious person from writing code that will hurt my computer?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All projects have their own governance systems. Within each project there is a trusted circle of contributors, called committers, that take responsibility for evaluating every contribution for accuracy and appropriateness before entering it in the code base. Many of the better run projects have special test programs (called unit tests) that automatically check inputs and outputs for accuracy. I know many proprietary software companies that do not apply this level of rigor in their QA.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why are companies using Open Source Software?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cost savings is just one reason why companies are interested in using Open Source. The companies that are really benefitting from Open Source Software use it because of the flexibility that it provides.  Companies that use Open Source Software do not have to worry about a vendors ceasing to support a product.  They can also be more self sufficient in diagnosing and solving problems with the software.  There is nothing worse than knowing of a bug and having a software vendor deny it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Who can I call when it breaks?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It depends on the software. Some software is supported just like proprietary software. In these cases there are companies that sell maintenance or support contracts that give you access to a help desk.  In other cases, there are mailing lists and forums where you can post questions and people are generally very helpful in giving answers.  These lists are also searchable so usually you can find your question already answered.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;How do I try Open Source?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A really good place to start is to dump Microsoft Internet Explorer and start using the Open Source browser &lt;a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/"&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt; I think you will find it is a better product and you will not have to worry about all that annoying Ad-Ware.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content>

    <title>A new metaphor for living with open source</title>
    <content type='html'>This morning I was meeting with a client and going over the list of outstanding issues.  The client chose to wait on some low priority issues because someone from the community was planning on fixing the bug in the next release.  There were other features that the client didn't think it was important enough to add.   In other cases, the client really needed the feature quickly so they wanted us to take care of it.  During the conversation I stumbled on this metaphor that resonated with me: buying commercial software is a little like living in a condo while using open source is like owning a house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you live in a condo, you pay a monthly fee and the condo association decides what to spend the money on and who does the work.  Having been part of a condo association, I know first-hand how groups make different decisions than individuals would.  When you own a home, you have a lot more control over what gets fixed/enhanced and who you hire to do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, the metaphor breaks down in the case of the community making a fix and you benefit without paying for it.  House ownership is not like that - although I am holding out hope that someone will just show up and fix our garage door.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you use open source software, there can be several ways to get a feature fixed or enhanced:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do it yourself&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Put a bounty out for the feature&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you are working with a consulting firm to do the overall implementation, you can add this to the scope of the project&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Find a couple other organizations that want the feature and host a sprint&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Partner with a company that sells a commercial software style maintenance plan.  There are several open source software companies that are built on this model.  In my house metaphor, this is a little like hiring a management company to take care of everything.  You pay a little more but you don't have to think about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;The point here is that with open source you have many more options for how you invest in the software's continued evolution.   You can opportunistically adopt new features that others have built and you can finance the implementation of features that you absolutely need to have right away.  If the software is just perfect for you as it is, you don't have invest anything.   In the commercial software world, you are required to pay but you have very little say how your money is spent - a little like that condo fee.</content>

    <title>Give Your Repository a REST</title>
    <content type='html'>Through my research and my client work I have been running across this recurring pattern of exposing a content repository through a &lt;a href="http://www.infoq.com/rest/"&gt;REST&lt;/a&gt; interface.  In the past, I have written about the JCR and &lt;a href="http://incubator.apache.org/sling/site/index.html"&gt;Sling&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.alfresco.com"&gt;Alfresco&lt;/a&gt;'s Web Scripts architecture.  I really like both of those implementations.  More recently, I have been working with a client who has built their own REST interface on top of &lt;a href="http://www.day.com/site/en/index/solutions/content_management.html.html"&gt;Day's CRX&lt;/a&gt;.  They started their project before Sling was a glimmer in Apache's eye and they took a slightly different approach.  Instead of using Sling's &lt;a href="http://dev.day.com/microsling/content/blogs/main/slingrequestprocessrevisited.html"&gt;repository-oriented request handling&lt;/a&gt;, or Alfresco's model of registering a Web Script (written in Javascript) to a particular path, my client has built out a full URL based query syntax through a servlet.  Right now, the syntax focuses on searching retrieving content and is very powerful.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The strategy of using a REST API for your repository solves a central problem with the JCR and other Java base repositories: remote connectivity.  Without a remote connectivity infrastructure like JDBC or ODBC, technologies wishing to talk to a Java repository must resort to connectivity like RMI (Remote Method Invocation) that are inefficient and do not necessarily play nicely with firewalls.  While not particularly efficient (lots of protocol layers and text processing), REST offers a nice foundation for enabling remote connectivity at the appropriate layer of abstraction (that is, how content is &lt;em&gt;logically stored&lt;/em&gt; - not how it is physically persisted).  There are many reasons why REST is a good strategy but I think that the most important ones are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is great infrastructure available for optimizing and controlling HTTP traffic.  For example, reverse proxy technologies like &lt;a href="http://www.squid-cache.org"&gt;Squid&lt;/a&gt; can stand in front of the REST interface and serve repeated requests out of cache.  Firewalls can be used to filter traffic with rules that evaluate the requested path and requester origin (beware &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address_spoofing"&gt;IP Address spoofing&lt;/a&gt;).  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;REST is entirely technology neutral. Everything talks HTTP and XML.  You can replace the implementation of either the server or the client with little risk to the overall architecture.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the only downside is that developing your own API is tricky business.  While you are free to change your underlying data structures, once you publish your API and start writing applications on it, you lock yourself in.  Where possible, it is best to support standardized query syntax like &lt;a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xquery"&gt;XQuery&lt;/a&gt; or the JCR query language in addition to your domain-specific methods.    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I expect to see this pattern of REST-based repository access to be pretty much the standard as we get into Web 2.0 architectures that support mash-up applications.  If they can address the overhead of all the text handling, more and more systems will use REST API's to de-couple the various components in the application stack.  Something to consider the next time you design a content-centric application.</content>

    <title>Hos(t)ed?</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class="thumbnail"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skitch.com/sggottlieb/pusx/502-server-error"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.skitch.com/20080613-f7i67c1xx7c4eum3kpbmq3qh3n.preview.jpg" alt="502 Server Error" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Lucida Grande, Trebuchet, sans-serif, Helvetica, Arial; font-size: 10px; color: #808080"&gt;Uploaded with &lt;a href="http://plasq.com/"&gt;plasq&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="http://skitch.com"&gt;Skitch&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There has been some interesting posts and white papers (for example, CrownPeak's whitepaper &lt;a href="http://www.crownpeak.com/InfoCenter/Index.aspx"&gt;"Open Source Isn't Free (It's not Even Cheap)" (registration required)&lt;/a&gt;) about the trade-off and relative merits of open source and hosted solutions.  I think this is an important topic because, as I have said before, both strategies are worth considering for companies looking to lower their up front costs of deploying (or redeploying) a website on a new platform.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As someone who covers open source software and who hosts their blog on &lt;a href="http://www.blogger.com"&gt;Blogger&lt;/a&gt;, you would think that I would have something to say about the matter... and of course I do.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It all boils down to a simple question of &lt;em&gt;"what business are you in?"&lt;/em&gt;  In the world of content I think there is a clear breakdown into two categories of businesses: content businesses and content &lt;em&gt;distribution&lt;/em&gt; businesses.  A content business competes on the basis of the quality and/or exclusivity of the content.  A content &lt;em&gt;distribution&lt;/em&gt; business competes on the accessibility, reach and engagement of the content consumption experience.  A content business will often partner with several content distribution businesses through syndication relationships.   Content distribution businesses often have the same content as their competitors and need differentiating technology.  Product companies (and other companies whose content is &lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt; their products) tend to operate and behave more like content business. They shouldn't care about the stickiness of their own website (I am reminded of the Web 1.0 bubble when Internet strategists tried to convince their clients that their business, whatever it was, would suffer if they failed to do something fancy on the web).   Content businesses (and product businesses) need their web presence to serve their customers, support their brand and reinforce their credibility.  They don't need to be sticky.  Professional, well organized, stable, and up to date is good enough (sadly, better than average). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net"&gt;Content Here&lt;/a&gt; is a content business.  You can read the articles here and &lt;a href="http://blog.contentmanagementconnection.com/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://contentcentric.org/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and probably other places as well (I am just happy you are reading them).  The tools I use to compose and publish content are &lt;a href="http://blog.contenthere.net/2008/06/i-use-this.html"&gt;cheap and simple&lt;/a&gt;.   I don't care if other websites have similar branding treatments (as a matter of fact, other websites have used this template).  I am satisfied with the average uptime standards that Google is able to provide.  Yes, blogspot does go down from time to time but at least when it does go down I don't have to frantically troubleshoot to get it back up - I just wait.  And, yes, I would like to to have a slick little &lt;a href="http://friendfeed.com"&gt;friendfeed&lt;/a&gt; commenting plugin.  But I have more important things to worry about like finishing my next report and blinding my consulting clients with value. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When there is a good fit, I include a SaaS products in CMS short-lists for my clients.  However, I often find that business users are drawn to the promise of what &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be done on high end commercial platforms (with adequate levels of customizations that will probably never be done).  A solid, simple, basic feature set on a product that is well managed is not sexy to a buyer.  Business users don't usually sit through a product demo and visualize what the UI would look like if it was broken because their I.T. department didn't invest the right time and resources to adequately configure, customize, host, and maintain the platform.  I.T. departments don't think enough about how hard these applications can be to upgrade.  The hosted solutions in the marketplace succeed with good customer service and smooth upgrades that lead to high retention rates - not through feature/function/flash competitions.  The UIs tend to be boring but functional.  Business users like feature/function/flash competitions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you make the right choices, hosted solutions can give you &lt;em&gt;better than average&lt;/em&gt; service at a lower cost (in terms of time or money) because they can take advantage of specialization and economy of scale. For example, an outsourced data center is going to have better failover and redundancy than an average corporate server room (much better than the converted desktop server with the noisy fan under my desk).  A hosted application is going to have better administration support than an average installed application.  Better than average is good enough for the &lt;em&gt;context&lt;/em&gt; aspects of your business but not the &lt;em&gt;core&lt;/em&gt; (I knew I would be dropping a little &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_Moore"&gt;Geoffrey Moore&lt;/a&gt; knowledge before this post was through).  For the core, you want excellence and to be excellent you have to invest disproportionate resources and ownership.  You can't settle with a service that your competitor can also buy and, therefore, have just as good you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I were in the content &lt;em&gt;distribution business&lt;/em&gt;, I would make the investment to achieve greater than average uptime and continually add new features to the website.  I would do a lot of custom development on the platform to make the functionality unique.  Open source would be a key component of the technical strategy because it would help achieve an optimum mix of a commodity foundation, fast-follower (me-too) features, and unique features that I built myself.  Instead, I am pleasantly surprised when I log in and notice that a new feature (that probably has been available on alternative platforms for ages) has been added.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is actually a lot of overlap between hosted and open source.  Most of the Software as a Service providers rely heavily on open source frameworks and components to deliver their services.  There is also a great opportunity for systems integrators and commercial open source companies to deploy highly managed, turnkey solutions using open source content management systems.  The customer doesn't even need to be aware that the solution is open source because they go directly to their partner if they need any help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class="thumbnail"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skitch.com/sggottlieb/p3wt/untitled"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.skitch.com/20080616-fne9nnkgfi4h21wqrsn6cmuf1y.preview.jpg" alt="Untitled" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Lucida Grande, Trebuchet, sans-serif, Helvetica, Arial; font-size: 10px; color: #808080"&gt;Uploaded with &lt;a href="http://plasq.com/"&gt;plasq&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="http://skitch.com"&gt;Skitch&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent developments in cloud computing and third party services allow businesses to specialize even more.  With a service like Amazon's &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html?node=201590011"&gt;EC2&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/S3-AWS-home-page-Money/b/ref=sc_fe_l_2?ie=UTF8&amp;node=16427261&amp;no=3435361&amp;me=A36L942TSJ2AJA"&gt;S3&lt;/a&gt; and Google's &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/"&gt;App Engine&lt;/a&gt; a company can specialize in software development and outsource the management of the underlying architecture and infrastructure.  This is great for companies that want to run research and development teams to rapidly execute and test out new business ideas.  But, to use these services companies need to be satisfied with the level of uptime that Amazon and Google are willing to provide.  Some cloud computing resources are delivered using excess capa&lt;br/&gt;city so we don't know what will happen when there is no surplus available.  I would feel better if the market for cloud computing was mature enough to establish a sustainable price and service level agreement.  Until that happens, if &lt;a href="http://www.jiploo.com/blog/99999-or-five-nines-uptime/"&gt;five nines&lt;/a&gt; of uptime is important to you, these services are not for you.  Better to run your own software at multiple data centers on different continents and have well vaccinated, highly caffeinated support staff monitoring things around the clock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is also a marketplace for add-on widgets (as an aside, what word do business school professors use to describe a fictitious product now that there are actual products called widgets?) like &lt;a href="http://js-kit.com/"&gt;JS-Kit&lt;/a&gt; that can be plugged into nearly any existing platform.  This trend allows a content distribution company to differentiate its offering by creating a unique assemblage of commonly available components.  To win with this strategy, the company has to get very good at vetting partners and integrating their solutions.  Trend spotting, partnership building, and integration become the core competencies rather than just software development.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are in the content distribution business, you are in the technology business because technology is how you distribute your content.  You need to be able to be able to execute a strategy with an appropriate balance of outsourcing, development, and assembly.  Outsource where you want to be good.  Build where you want to be great or unique.  Or, if your special sauce is going to be breadth, get really good at finding the right third party providers to partner with and integrate their solutions in ways that allow you to nimbly shift from parter to partner.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Marketing I.T. in the Cloud</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;For a long time, I have been advocating that marketing organizations build technology capabilities.  &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2008/07/product-it-vs-enterprise-it.html"&gt;Marketing I.T. and Enterprise I.T. have totally different mindsets&lt;/a&gt;. Marketing I.T. is more like product development with an emphasis on opportunity and innovation. Traditional I.T. prioritizes stability and cost control. Increasingly I have seen ownership of digital marketing technology moving from I.T. to marketing.  Now I have a front row seat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the unexpected aspects of my job here at &lt;a href="http://www.lionbridge.com"&gt;Lionbridge&lt;/a&gt; is that I run Marketing I.T. In particular, I manage our hosting infrastructure and work with teams developing new sites and applications on it. Given that many marketing organizations are inheriting this responsibility, I figured I would share some of the tools/services that I have found useful.  I am going to talk about a lot of different products here.  I am not endorsed by any of these companies and I am only mentioning products that I like.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;h2&gt;Hosting: Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Rackspace Cloud&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;p&gt;We do everything in the cloud. We set up a multi-server infrastructure on AWS using Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2: virtual servers), the Elastic Load Balancing service (ELB), and Relational Database Service (RDS). Both ELB and RDS span multiple physical data centers which is good for availability.  We have EC2 instances in multiple data centers too.  Our sites are also replicated to infrastructure hosted on Rackspace Cloud so that if AWS has a major problem, we can re-route traffic over to Rackspace.  We test our sites on Rackspace weekly.  Both AWS and Rackspace are great.  AWS has many more features but the tech support is very limited. You need to pay extra for support and it can take a while to get an answer.  Rackspace support is amazing.  If you don't have a decent sysadmin, I would go with Rackspace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://ylastic.com/"&gt;Ylastic&lt;/a&gt; makes administering AWS services much easier.  The UI is not pretty but it is much better organized for doing specific tasks like managing backups and migrating and configuring servers.  Ylastic also gives some insight into the health of the overall AWS infrastructure.  The mobile UI is a big step up over the AWS management console on the little screen.  We just use the basic level.  At higher levels, you get some functionality to help manage your spend.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;h2&gt;Monitoring and Alerting: ServerDensity, CloudWatch, and PagerDuty&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;p&gt;AWS comes with its own monitoring service called CloudWatch.  We have set up notifications to fire if the load balancer removes one of our servers because it isn't responding.  We also wanted to have external monitoring services running so we could look at our RackSpace servers.  Plus, it's a good idea to have your monitoring service independent from your hosting infrastructure in case your hosting infrastructure is too compromised to send an alert.  We learned this the hard way when an AWS outage took out our monitoring as well.  Most of our monitoring is done with a service called &lt;a href="http://www.serverdensity.com"&gt;ServerDensity&lt;/a&gt;. This keeps track of internal server health metrics and we have it pinging the sites to make sure they are responding.  &lt;a href="https://www.pingdom.com/"&gt;Pingdom&lt;/a&gt; is also useful for checking if a site is up.  We would use that if we didn't have ServerDensity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;p&gt;We do all of our alerting through a service called &lt;a href="http://www.pagerduty.com/"&gt;PagerDuty&lt;/a&gt;.  While all monitoring services can send out pages and emails, the nice thing about PagerDuty is that you can set up on-call schedules and escalation pathways.  This is important because I have a really small team and everyone has other jobs (which can require travel).  Even a non-techie can be on the "site may be down" alert.  Usually this is a false positive because one of the servers in the cluster bounced in and out of the load balancer. Whoever gets the notification checks the site and texts a resolution code back (resolve, acknowledge, or escalate). I have trained non-techies to update the DNS to send traffic to Rackspace in the case of an emergency.&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;h2&gt;Code Management: BitBucket&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;p&gt;We have lots of different people building sites for us. Some are on staff, others are contractors or external agencies.  We use BitBucket (with Git) for source code management.  This allows me to easily bring in a contributor but thoroughly review his/her code before merging it into our code base.  We follow the classic &lt;a href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BITBUCKET/Fork+a+Repo%2C+Compare+Code%2C+and+Create+a+Pull+Request"&gt;"Fork/Pull Request model"&lt;/a&gt;.  Some developers/agencies get it better than others.  I am weeding out the folks who don't get it because it makes my life harder.  I don't want to deal with zip files of directories and worry about coordinating the changes from different people.  With a pull request, I can see every change and easily merge.&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;h2&gt;People&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;p&gt;While all of this technology is great, it's the people that make it go.  As I mentioned earlier, my team is small.  We get a lot of design and development help from outside contractors and agencies.  I share sysadmin work with a really good contractor that knows much more than I do about managing servers.  Having a "virtual team" is nice for scalability but it sometimes presents challenges for scheduling.  I found a web project manager (with the help of my &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2012/08/an-unconventional-approach-to-recruiting.html"&gt;one field job application&lt;/a&gt;) who can handle a lot of basic tech tasks like running deployments and migrating sites. She has SSH access to all of our servers and can do things like restart Apache. She only started a couple of weeks ago and she is already making a huge contribution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Process&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;p&gt;We track all of our work in a ticket tracking tool called DOT (which we also use for our &lt;a href="http://www.globalmarketingops.com/"&gt;GMO&lt;/a&gt; clients).  We also use DOT for tracking time so we can see how much effort we spend on various development projects.  We group infrastructure projects into milestones that represent maintenance windows.  Leading up to a maintenance window, we prepare the fixes and test them on a QA environment.  We defer tickets that we are not confident that we can complete.  Once the milestone is locked down, we send out an email to stakeholders explaining what we are doing, when we are doing it, and how it could possibly affect them.  Then, after we complete the maintenance window, we send out a completed email, reminding of any relevant changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, I am impressed with what a small team can do on a limited budget.  By using cloud-based technologies, we can afford levels of redundancy and sophistication that would be prohibitively expensive to buy up-front: multiple data centers, generators, alerting systems, source code management…  People-wise, we probably have around .5 FTE spread across several people (internal and external) managing and extending this infrastructure. These people have other responsibilities such as building and managing our services and products.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best part of this whole arrangement is that we can be ultra-responsive.  If something is important to a marketing initiative, we can act on it immediately.  Our work does not go into a larger queue, where it may be misassigned or assigned to someone who doesn't have the complete context to do the work properly.  The social dynamic is different as well.  We are part of the team.  Our motivations are aligned and we don't have those defensive postures that I.T. needs to fend off the entire organization.  When we push back, we do so as peers and can explain why in terms that our peers can relate to.  I think all mid  to large sized organizations need a marketing I.T. team and this seems like a good way to structure it.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Community Development</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I have finally gotten around to reading Clay Shirky's excellent book &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0143114948?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=contenthere-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0143114948"&gt;Here Comes Everybody&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=contenthere-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0143114948" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /&gt;.  I love Clay's writing style and the way his perspectives make me think.  One of the points that really resonated with me was about open source.  But before I get into it, I should say that when Clay talks about open source, he is really talking about community developed open source (not &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2009/01/is-it-open-source-does-it-matter.html"&gt;commercial&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2006/06/nice-article-on-selecting-open-source-software.html"&gt;institutional&lt;/a&gt; open source).  Readers of this blog know that the designation "open source" simply means that it is licensed under an &lt;a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses"&gt;OSI certified license&lt;/a&gt;.  "Open source" says nothing about &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; the software was developed.  Given that disclaimer, Clay nails it when he describes the advantage of community developed software:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The bulk of open source projects fail, and most of the remaining successes are quite modest.  But does that mean the threat from open systems generally is overrated and the commercial software industry can breathe easy?  Here the answer is no.  Open source is a profound threat, not because the open source ecosystem is outsuccessing commercial efforts but because it is outfailing them.  Because the open source ecosystem, and by extension open social ecosystems generally, rely on peer production, the work on those systems can be considerably more experimental at a considerable less cost, than any firm can afford.  (&lt;em&gt;from page 245 of the hard cover version&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;This quote comes from a chapter called "Failure for Free" that discusses the importance of failure for innovation.  The key point is that traditional companies can't afford to really innovate because they must limit their bets to initiatives that they feel have a high likelihood of success.  Innovation winds up being constrained to small tweaks to things that are well known.  Real breakthroughs are rare.  Community development doesn't make better ideas but it reduces the cost (and risk) of trying ideas that at first seem unlikely to succeed.  Out of all this experimentation comes unexpected successes. Even the failures provide useful data that can be turned into future successes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When open source critics see the volume of incomplete or dead open source projects as evidence against the sustainability of open source, they are missing the point.  A low success rate is critical to real innovation; but that is hard to understand by someone for whom failure is discouraged or not tolerated at all.  It is widely accepted that the best design for an experiment is one with a 50% chance of failure: if you know what the outcome will be, the experiment is not worth doing.  But if the cost (in time and resources) of the experiment is zero or close to it, the ideal failure rate is much higher.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While we have seen many examples of community developed software out-innovating its commercial peers, this phenomenon has very little to do with open source.  An open source license can create an environment that invites contribution by reducing the risk that one will exploit and unduly profit from another's contribution. But what is more important is &lt;em&gt;how the software is managed&lt;/em&gt;.  Most successful open source projects have adopted an architecture consisting of a  core that is tightly managed for stability and quality and is extensible by adding modules.  The bar for module code is considerably lower than core code.  This allows an open and dynamic community to experiment with new ideas.  The community not only bears the cost of failure but it also brings in new perspectives that the core maintainers don't have.  Some of these extensions will be absorbed into the core or will become part of a commonly used bundle.  Others will wither and die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This pattern of stable core and innovative fringe does not have to be unique to open source.  It doesn't really matter how the core is licensed if entry into the fringe is open.  The one area that open source licensing helps with the core is in achieving a level of ubiquity that attracts a community.  High licensing fees or the bottleneck of a traditional software sales process can limit the size of the user base and discourage contribution.  The community developer needs the promise of a large user base to justify the time investment of contributing his work.  But open source is not the only way to achieve a large user base and there are plenty of examples of commercial software and SaaS user communities that have a successful code sharing ecosystem.  One company that is particularly successful is &lt;a href="http://www.salesforce.com/"&gt;Salesforce.com&lt;/a&gt;.  Salesforce has created a very powerful API and module packaging framework.  More importantly, they have priced the product to penetrate small-medium sized companies and non-profits.  In particular, the &lt;a href="http://foundation.force.com/home"&gt;Salesforce Foundation makes the product very inexpensive for non-profits&lt;/a&gt;.  These strategies have infused the customer population with lots companies that are highly motivated to share.  These customers are active both within the &lt;a href="http://sites.force.com/appexchange/home"&gt;AppExchange&lt;/a&gt; community and also integrating 3rd party open source projects like &lt;a href="http://plone.org"&gt;Plone&lt;/a&gt; (see &lt;a href="http://groups.google.com/group/plonesf"&gt;Plone/Salesforce Integration&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href="http://drupal.org"&gt;Drupal&lt;/a&gt; (see &lt;a href="http://drupal.org/project/salesforce"&gt;Salesforce module&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the flip side, there are plenty of commercial open source software companies that not been able to leverage community development.  There are two primary ways an open source software product can prevent community development from flourishing.  First, there can be factors that limit adoption of the core like in the case of &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2009/10/open-core.html"&gt;open core&lt;/a&gt; products that discourage the use of the open source version.  Second, the architecture can be monolithic so the only way for an outsider to add a feature is to fork the codebase.  All a software producer has to do is solve those two problems.  The supplier doesn't even really need to provide tools for sharing code.  If the install base is large (which usually means the software is useful) and the architecture is modular, developers will find a way to communicate and share code.  They can use services like &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/"&gt;Google Code&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://github.com/"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="http://sourceforge.net/"&gt;SourceForge&lt;/a&gt; to collaborate.  Too often companies put code sharing tools in place without solving those two problems and then complain when they don't see any activity.   In many cases, the user audience is too small to support a contributing ecosystem.  In other cases, the incentives are not lined up appropriately.  Shirky calls the three ingredients of a collaborative community: promise, tools, and bargain.  The promise is what the contributor can expect to get out of participating; the bargain is the terms and rules for participating.  Open source licensing helps with the promise and the bargain. The open source promise is that others may help improve your code.  The open source bargain is that people can't take exclusive ownership and profit from your work.  Some communities, like Salesforce and &lt;a href="http://joomla.org"&gt;Joomla!&lt;/a&gt; have thriving commercial extension marketplaces.  In those cases the promise and bargain are different but they are very motivating.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any widely used software application, if it is appropriately designed, can benefit from community development and the benefits are not limited to the successful contributions.  Perhaps the biggest value of community development is increased innovation through reducing the cost of failure.  In order to harvest this value, a company needs to actively monitor, analyze and participate in its community.  There is a goldmine of information sitting in the chaff of failed contributions as well as the modules that do gain traction.  Companies that ignore this value do so at their own peril.  &lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Facebook as your Intranet?</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;At the &lt;a href="http://cmf2007.dk"&gt;cmf2007&lt;/a&gt; conference last week, there were some great sessions and conversations about intranets including James Robertson's presentation of the &lt;a href="http://www.steptwo.com.au/iia/"&gt;2007 Intranet Innovation Awards&lt;/a&gt; . There were also many interesting discussions about &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; inspired by &lt;a href="http://www.cmf2007.dk/speakers/bj_fogg"&gt;BJ Fogg's insightful keynote on persuasive technology&lt;/a&gt; (this guy knows his Facebook - he teaches a &lt;a href="http://credibilityserver.stanford.edu/captology/facebook/"&gt;college course on it&lt;/a&gt; at Stanford). The two topics merged with the provocative assertion: "Facebook will be your next intranet." The idea has been clattering around in my head all week and then I read this news that &lt;a href="http://intranetblog.blogware.com/blog/_archives/2007/11/5/3336073.html"&gt;Serena is starting to use Facebook as their Intranet&lt;/a&gt; on Toby Ward's Intranet Blog. I am sure that Toby's article was what got the whole conversation going but I didn't know it at the time. Apparently, the CEO of Serena is a huge Facebook user and has designated Friday as a day when employees should spend an hour exploring and interacting on Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;What fascinates me about this idea is that most Intranets fail as social collaboration tools because they cannot capture the energy and passion that seems to form spontaneously on the web. At least that is my theory. And my theory goes on to assert that people do not invest their personal energy on their corporate intranet because they don't own it. While people do not own Facebook, there is a tacit agreement that a user's Facebook profile belongs to the user. The user can always access it and edit it and he is free to do with it what he wants. A corporate intranet cannot provide this assurance. When the employee leaves the company all the creativity, personality and knowledge invested in the corporate intranet are lost to him. A user has a right to feel like he owns his personality, friendships and ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because people are not owned by their employers, they interact in a community that transcends corporate boundaries. This is why internal instant message system are never as popular as AIM, YIM, and MSN Messenger. This is also why email crushed those internal messaging systems that companies used to use. You need to communicate (professionally and socially) with people outside of the firewall as much as you do inside the firewall. If your network is entirely contained by your company. Stop reading this blog post immediately and go out and meet some people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Internal communities of practice fail because the population is not large enough to support them. If you ever took an ecology course, this is similar to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Island_biogeography"&gt;Island Biogeography.&lt;/a&gt; Just as species cannot survive in small, isolated pockets, neither than communities of interest. You need a population that is big enough to allow healthy turnover and new ideas. If you are interested in a topic, you would do better to join a large open community than to try to start one with the three people in your company that share your interest. It used to be that the physical proximity provided by and office made intra-office communities more viable. Now, with the Internet, location is less of an issue. Being co-workers is an arbitrary requirement to community building that often stands in the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, back to Facebook. The biggest argument against Facebook as the corporate intranet is information security. Much of the information that employees work with needs to stay within the company. Furthermore, there is a fear that allowing employees to be visible makes them vulnerable to being stolen by other companies. If your company is such a bad place to work that the only thing retaining employees is that no one knows about them to hire them away, you have bigger problems than your Intranet. Ideally, employees from other companies would see your employees on Facebook and all the fun they are having and want to come and work for you. Even if they do not come to work for you, they might be inspired to provide feedback or information that will be of some value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facebook would be a poor place for people to collaborate on company projects and other strategic stuff. However, how much of this information actually needs to be private? Does a company holiday calendar need to be private? Probably not. An interesting exercise would be to go though your Intranet and identify all the content that could be out in the open or at least minimally protected. While you are at it, you should identify information on your intranet that nobody needs to see. Now I am getting into &lt;a href="http://www.cmf2007.dk/speakers/bob_boiko"&gt;Bob Boiko's talk "Leading with Information"&lt;/a&gt;. That deserves another post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facebook's &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/networks/networks.php?view=companies&amp;amp;browse&amp;amp;q=A"&gt;"Network" feature&lt;/a&gt; supports workplace networks. This allows a user to take their profile (that &lt;i&gt;he&lt;/i&gt; owns) and use it within a closed community. The same profile can, at the same time, be used in external communities. When the employee leaves the company, he just leaves the network. All the other aspects of his profile stay with him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I guess it all depends on what you hope to achieve in your intranet. If you want to provide tools to facilitate specific workplace functions and information, then a closed intranet makes the most sense. If you are trying to create communities and build social and professional connections, you can't beat the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content>

    <title>FeedBurner and Blogger</title>
    <content type='html'>A funny thing happened to me a couple of days ago when I completed my move to WordPress by deleting Enter Content Here from &lt;a href="http://www.blogger.com"&gt;Blogger&lt;/a&gt;. The old RSS feed (http://contenthere.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default), which &lt;a href="http://feedburner.google.com"&gt;FeedBurner&lt;/a&gt; somehow kept alive with new content posted on WordPress, suddenly went dark.  The net result was that I lost my first 300 (or so) subscribers.  To them, I stopped blogging after my &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2009/02/ez-publish-fork.html"&gt;eZ Publish Fork post&lt;/a&gt; on February 25th.  Hopefully, these subscribers will notice the fetch errors and repoint to &lt;a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/EnterContentHere"&gt;http://feedproxy.google.com/EnterContentHere&lt;/a&gt; (please spread the word).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What took me off guard was that the old RSS feed was &lt;em&gt;being updated by the new site rather than the old site&lt;/em&gt;.  I think this is because I elected to "merge my feeds" (or something like that) when Google bought FeedBurner.  The readers who were subscribed to my old blogspot feed didn't notice my warning posts and the fact that I made the old blog look really ugly by changing the template.  They saw the new posts and clicked through to the new blog.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, if you are thinking about moving off of Blogger, &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2009/01/getting-your-google-mojo-back.html"&gt;first read this post&lt;/a&gt;.  Then, if you merged your feeds, remember to put a couple of warning posts on &lt;em&gt;your new blog&lt;/em&gt; to let people know you are moving before you delete your old Blogger blog.</content>

    <title>Infrae&amp;#39;s Document Library</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Recently &lt;a href="http://blog.wohlrapp.com/"&gt;Sebastian Wohlrapp&lt;/a&gt; and I published a &lt;a href="http://www.optaros.com/wp/wp_6_os_docManagement.shtml"&gt;whitepaper on open source document management systems&lt;/a&gt;.  If you are looking for a solution in this area, you also might want to add &lt;a href="http://www.infrae.com/download/documentlibrary"&gt;Infrae's Document Library&lt;/a&gt; to the list of products to consider.  I have not yet tried Document Library but have used their &lt;a href="http://www.infrae.com/download/Silva"&gt;Silva&lt;/a&gt; WCM product which does a very good job of versioning and workflow.  One thing that caught my eye is their support of the &lt;a href="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/openarchivesprotocol.html"&gt;Open Archives Initiative's Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH)&lt;/a&gt; which might become an important standard for companies implementing a distributed/federated content management strategy.  Here is a good description from the &lt;a href="http://www.oaforum.org/tutorial/english/page1.htm"&gt;OAI-PMH Tutorial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The essence of the open archives approach is to enable access to Web-accessible material through interoperable repositories for metadata sharing, publishing and archiving. It arose out of the e-print community, where a growing need for a low-barrier interoperability solution to access across fairly heterogeneous repositories lead to the establishment of the Open Archives Initiative (OAI). The OAI develops and promotes a low-barrier interoperability framework and associated standards, originally to enhance access to e-print archives, but now taking into account access to other digital materials. As it says in the OAI mission statement "The Open Archives Initiative develops and promotes interoperability standards that aim to facilitate the efficient dissemination of content."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If OAI-PMH sounds interesting, you may also want to consider looking at &lt;a href="http://dspace.org/"&gt;DSpace&lt;/a&gt; which is gaining adoption in academic research environments such as &lt;a href="http://www.mit.edu"&gt;MIT&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;In addition to OAI-PMH, Document Library does automatic document conversion (using OpenOffice - just like Alfresco), workflow, versioning and other things you would expect from a DMS.  In terms of architecture, Document Library is built on the Zope 3 platform and uses the &lt;a href="http://www.infrae.com/download/tramline"&gt;Silva Tramline&lt;/a&gt; for rapid upload and download of files.  &lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Evolutionary Software Development: A Model for Maintaining Web Sites
and Applications</title>
    <content type='html'>Since I got into software development back in 1995, I have been exposed to many different software development methodologies. I started out with a highly structured waterfall model (which is hard to avoid with fixed bid projects). Whenever possible, I have advocated agile approaches and I have been on teams that have practiced agile methods like Scrum with varying degrees of fidelity. Overall, I love &lt;a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/"&gt;the values of agile&lt;/a&gt; but the agile methodologies that I know of don't quite feel right for the kind of work I do now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These days my job focuses on managing several different web sites and applications. Officially, you could say that these applications are in "maintenance mode" but the truth is that they were always in maintenance mode. All of these applications have been built on the philosophy of a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product"&gt;minimum viable product&lt;/a&gt;. That is, we developed a minimal solution to test a) that the problem actually exists and b) that our idea is an effective way of solving it. The initial solutions were just complete enough to answer these questions and create a foundation for an evolutionary process towards continuous improvement. Everything since has been "maintenance."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The agile development methodologies that I know of don't quite fit because they all seem to focus on a notion of defining a 2-3 week "release" or "sprint" and putting the entire team onto cadence that begins with planning and ends with some kind of review. But my teams do not work that way. We release one feature at a time. We don't wait for some large milestone to push new code into production. In fact, we push a new feature as soon as it is ready. We see an un-published feature as a huge liability. Worse than simply not being able to get the benefit of the feature or see how the audience responds to it, unpublished code is a risk. When code sits in an unpublished state it needs to be maintained like working code. Otherwise, when you deploy it, you are likely to break other things. Also, large deployments are riskier than small deployments and make problems harder to diagnose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We try to define features to be small as possible. Some features are "below the waterline." That is, they are not visible to the end user and are only deployed to support another feature in the future. A very common example of this pattern is that we usually do our database work up front. For example, if we need to build a new page design, we will start by deploying the new fields that the design requires. Then our content team can add the data. Later, once the data is in place, we can deploy our page templates and other application logic that relies on the new data. We also commonly deploy infrastructure upgrades ahead of the features that they support. We also try phasing in features with an initial simplistic implementation to test out the concept and then a series of enhancements to reach the full potential.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you are maintaining a live application, the line between a bug and enhancement is blurred and the same team should responsible for both. Anyone on the team needs to be able to pull herself away from the feature she is working on to fix an urgent issue. This is another reason why keeping things small is very important. It is also why it is so important to have a very clearly defined prioritization protocol. Ours is:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;Site down&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;Feature broken with no work around&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;Feature broken with work around&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;Revenue opportunity&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;Customer Usability&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;Operations Usability&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;Brand consistency&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The product manager is in charge of setting the priorities and assigning high priority issues that need to get taken care of ASAP.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The lines between coding, content, infrastructure, and support are also blurred. Sometimes an issue is noticed and the cause is not immediately apparent. For example, let's say a customer cannot download a file. It could be that the file was not added in the first place. The code to retrieve the file could be broken. The server could be out of space and the file could not be saved. It could be a usability issue and the customer was clicking on the wrong link. Triaging and coordinating this work is critical needs to be core to the methodology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Refactoring is another big part of the methodology. You often run into situations where a feature gets a lot of traction but not in the way that you expected. You might need to change how it was built to allow it to evolve in the right direction. You will also need to refactor your successful experiments to support active use. The concept of a "user story" (common in agile methodologies) does not lend itself well to code refactoring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you can see, traditional agile methodologies do not accommodate the day to day activities required to maintain and extend an actively used web application. This is because they are designed at their core to support software development &lt;i&gt;projects&lt;/i&gt; where the team has the luxury of ignoring the operational aspects of running the application as a service. But that luxury comes at a price: alienation from critical feedback by actual consumers of the application. In agile, a "customer" role filters and simplifies end user needs and tastes. This customer makes a lot of guesses about what the end customers want. The guesses tend to be big and there is no process for correcting the wrong ones. The agile approaches that I know of seem better for building packaged software or for integration companies that are brought in to build something and leave. These are cases where you cannot or don't want to be told that you need improve something right after you thought you built it to specification.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here is a very real world example to illustrate that point. We use LivePerson to chat with customers who are on our sites. Sometimes there are cases when a customer gets stuck because he does not notice or cannot understand an error message — such as one telling him that he needs to enter something into a certain field. If it is common enough, we will use that feedback to design, implement, and deploy a fix that makes the validation message more visible and understandable. Fixing this issue could be hugely important to conversions. But think about how this problem might be solved in Scrum. A "user story" would be added to the backlog. At some point, this story makes it into the next sprint. It needs to wait for the rest of the sprint to finish before it is deployed. If you do two-week sprints, that could be up to a four-week turn around. You might say that you would handle this in a maintenance track that runs in parallel to your &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; development. But I would counter that tweaks like this are where applications succeed and fail and should be the focus of (not the exception to) your process. In fact, I think you should think of everything as a tweak.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite the fact that lots of organizations are maintaining sophisticated web applications and want to experiment with new features as fast as possible, I have found little writing on formal methodologies to support this. The best writing comes from the DevOps community but they don't directly often address the actual software development as much as I would hope. I like Eric Ries's chapter on continuous deployment in &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0043M4Z34/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B0043M4Z34&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=contenthere-20"&gt;Web Operations: Keeping the Data On Time&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" alt="" src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=contenthere-20&amp;amp;l=as2&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=B0043M4Z34" width="1" height="1" border="0" /&gt;. Speaking of Eric Ries, lean startup literature is also a very good resource. But this community emphasizes customer development and doesn't explore the architecture/implementation side as much as I would like.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What really inspired me to write this post was this relatively obscure research paper called "&lt;a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~brewer/papers/online-evolution-draft.pdf"&gt;An Online Evolutionary Approach to Developing Internet Services&lt;/a&gt;." This fit the bill when I was looking for a term to describe how we work. The word "evolution" is perfect. It captures the idea that development is a series of small modifications that respond to stresses and opportunities. Each modification is tested in the real world. The ineffective ones die off. The good ones are the foundation for future progress. It is true natural selection. We just try to be a little less random than biological evolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I would love to hear your feedback on this. I go back and forth between thinking that we are outliers for working in this way to thinking that this process is so universal that nobody thinks about it. I also think there is a lot to discuss with regards to testing, communicating changes to users, and localizing the solution.</content>

    <title>Java is losing the battle for the modern web</title>
    <content type='html'>There is a &lt;a href="http://www.theserverside.com"&gt;hot dialog going over at The Server Side&lt;/a&gt; that starts with a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisking"&gt;Fisking&lt;/a&gt; of (&lt;a href="http://www.php.net"&gt;PHP&lt;/a&gt; co-author) Andi Gutman's blog post  &lt;a href="http://andigutmans.blogspot.com/2008/03/java-is-losing-battle-for-modern-web.html"&gt;"Java is losing the battle for the modern Web. Can the JVM save the vendors?"&lt;/a&gt;.  The basic premise of Andi's article is that, despite support for dynamic languages (Jython, JRuby, etc.), the JVM will have a hard time keeping up with the modern web's demands for flexibility, performance, and agility.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As one would expect on &lt;a href="http://www.theserverside.com"&gt;TSS&lt;/a&gt;, the audience is definitely biased toward Java and there is a fair share of "PHP programmers can't code."  However, there are also plenty of well supported  arguments in the comments too - even a little bit of introspection.  No Springer-esque chair throwing but definitely worth a scan.</content>

    <title>Step right up and watch me change this page! Blindfolded!</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Over the years I have seen well over a hundred web content management system demos.  I have even done a few myself.  But it doesn't take watching many demos before you notice that they all follow the same general patterns.  "Watch me change this page." "This is how I find the content I was looking for." "Doesn't this demo website look nicer than yours?" OK, the last one is more implied than said.  In this era of Web Experience Management, there are some new elements to the story.  "See how this page looks differently to different audiences with different intents on different platforms?"  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don't get me wrong.  I still get excited by the possibilities of technology that can show a visitor &lt;em&gt;the perfect content in the ideal format&lt;/em&gt;.  The problem is that achieving this goal assumes that the user knows what the perfect content and ideal format are.  But we don't &amp;mdash; not by a long shot.  The best we can do is preview a page pretending to be a visitor; and that takes a lot of guesswork.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The missing element in this story is the visitor. That is significant because the visitor is the heart of WEM.  After all, the "E" in "WEM" stands for the visitor's experience, not the experience of the content editor previewing the page. How do we get the visitor into the center of the demo's narrative? It is hard to switch back and forth between the visitor and the editor without making the demo appear choppy and disjointed.  Besides, as I said earlier, we usually don't know as much about the visitor as we would like to.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps a better way would be to use data to represent the visitor. Having done demos, I know that showing transactional data (like web traffic) is a real challenge. You need to have lots of recent data to make the demo look realistic.  This is why the analytics segment of a WCM demo usually falls flat.  The demo environment usually just has a few hits &amp;mdash; not enough to see any real trends.  That said, wouldn't it be great to go through a scenario that begins with realistic visitor traffic data?  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I could imagine a story that started in an analytics area with the identification of an under performing section of the site. Perhaps, you are getting search traffic on the wrong key words.  Maybe a lot of people get to the page but then you loose them.  Maybe you dig a little deeper and you notice particularly low conversion rates within what you thought was a high potential audience segment. At this point you could show how you reconcile audience segments between the analytics package and the WCMS   personalization engine. That is, the CMS might have a "big spender" visitor profile, but how do you see that same population on the analytics side?  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From there, you might validate that these visitors are seeing what you configured them to see.  Going deeper, you might notice that "big spenders" are predominantly coming from mobile devices.  You preview the personalized page on a mobile emulator and, BAM, the answer hits you in the face.  The graphic that you thought would be so compelling to this group doesn't scale very well on mobile and makes the page unusable.  Only then do you start editing content.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There could be many variations of this story but the key point is that the platform is helping solve the biggest obstacle to engaging visitors: understanding them.  I would argue that unless you understand your visitors to this level, you shouldn't even touch personalization functionality.  You are not engaging visitors; you are stereotyping them and then ignoring them. You may even be making their experiences worse because you haven't really tested what they will see. You are flying blind. What kind of business value is there in tool that facilitates unproductive tasks?  I would argue less than none.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Ingredients for a good software development project</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;While nearly all of my consulting work is in software selection and technical strategy, I try to have at least one implementation project in the works so that I can stay relevant as a technologist.  For my current project, I am building the technology infrastructure for a new web based startup.  The project is going really well and I thought I would share some reasons why.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Great Client.&lt;/strong&gt;  My client is totally non technical and this is his first startup.  He found me through a mutual friend that we both think very highly of.  His lack of technology experience means he has not picked up any of the bad habits of technology owners.  He didn't force a detailed Gantt chart with a bunch of imaginary dates and tasks.  His trust in me helped us to collaboratively prioritize and plan work around his schedule.  I have followed through on all of my commitments so the trust has only gotten stronger.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fluid Design.&lt;/strong&gt;  The concept has evolved substantially since its original inception.  A critical part of the design process involves going through the application with prospective customers and then talking through how to incorporate their feedback.  We have done a really good job of keeping things flexible without adding complexity.  Some of the more speculative ideas are faked a bit until we get an indication of their viability.  The underlying machinery is only reworked when we are really onto something.  We have plans to do a holistic refactoring once the design is frozen and we are ready to start preparing the application for beta customers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strong Frameworks.&lt;/strong&gt;  Building the application on top of the &lt;a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/"&gt;Django&lt;/a&gt; web application framework makes development incredibly fast.  Python has a great unit test system where the tests are written in the comments of the code.  This makes them easy to maintain.  All of the data administration interfaces are provided for free and, because everything is data driven, the client has a lot of control over what he shows potential investors.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Simple Tools.&lt;/strong&gt;  All of the work is planned using tickets and milestones in a service called &lt;a href="http://unfuddle.com/"&gt;Unfuddle&lt;/a&gt; (looks a lot like &lt;a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/"&gt;Trac&lt;/a&gt;).  The information is very accessible and email notifications keep everyone up to date.  I am probably going to bring another developer on board to help with the beta and I think that setting him or her up with a development environment is going to be really easy. Just pull everything down from Subversion and launch the text editor of choice.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am not fooling myself into thinking all projects can be like this.  You don't always get to choose your clients or your tools.  Often other constraints are forced upon you.  But you can make some adjustments to achieve incremental improvements.  For example, on another project for a very large, established client, I used to say "we are going over a waterfall in an agile barrel" meaning that the upper management saw a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model"&gt;waterfall model project plan&lt;/a&gt; but internally, we were being as agile as possible.  We tried to be vague rather than guess and commit.  We made decisions that didn't preclude other options.  We made opportunities to refactor code. So, rather than throwing up your hands and accepting a recipe for failure, think of how you can get the ingredients for success.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Joomla! vs WordPress Usability: A Simple Case of Disruption</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.playingwithwire.com/2009/03/open-source-and-usability-joomla-vs-wordpress/"&gt;PlayingWithWire has a usability comparison between WordPress and Joomla!&lt;/a&gt; that has gotten a lot of attention on &lt;a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=09/03/03/0152241&amp;from=rss"&gt;Slashdot&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://forum.joomla.org/viewtopic.php?f=304&amp;t=377189&amp;start=0&amp;sid=19b61ce2e982ea2c1aa6484ae9f6633c"&gt;Joomla! forums&lt;/a&gt;.  The debate as is as you would expect: &lt;a href="http://wordpress.org"&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt; is more usable; &lt;a href="http://joomla.org"&gt;Joomla!&lt;/a&gt; is more powerful.   I don't disagree with either position.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think this highlights the fact that WordPress is at a point in its progression where it can handle many simple web content management use cases but has not yet achieved a level of complexity as to detract from its usability.  It has truly become a viable lightweight CMS - not just a blogging tool.  This makes WordPress and platforms like it (&lt;a href="http://www.movabletype.org/"&gt;Movable Type&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://expressionengine.com/"&gt;Expression Engine&lt;/a&gt;, etc.) disruptive technologies in the classic &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disruptive_technology"&gt;Christensen disruption model&lt;/a&gt; where a simple technology reaches a point where it can compete against a more complex incumbent that over-delivers in functionality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disruption model usually focuses on price; the challenger technology is cheaper than the incumbent.  Not that long ago, we were talking about open source as the disruptor (we still are. Just look at all the chatter about the Linux powered Netbooks).  In this case, however, both are open source and free.  Here, the cost is in the effort it takes to understand and use the technology.  Writing good content is hard enough without the barrier of a hard to use web content management system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a clear trend of companies leaning toward simpler technologies that may not meet all of the extended requirements but are very effective in the primary use cases (in this case, publishing pages and articles).  There comes a point where a simple tool reaches its limitations but many companies are prepared to make compromises or doubt whether they will ever need the fuller feature set - at least in the near term.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The incumbent CMS products are not taking this lying down.  Many of the commercial products on the market offer a simplified, "task-based" user interface for the casual user as an alternative to their traditional "power user" interfaces.  But even unused and unseen functionality has a cost in the complexity of implementation and the cost to support. If your website is very simple and you don't have any power users on staff, a simplistic, lightweight CMS (like WordPress) may be sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>All bugs are shallow</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.informationweek.com"&gt;Information Week&lt;/a&gt; recently published an &lt;a href="http://www.informationweek.com/news/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=205602186"&gt;article about an ongoing study of software bugginess&lt;/a&gt;. In 2006, a Homeland Security sponsored &lt;a href="http://www.coverity.com/"&gt;Coverity&lt;/a&gt; study of the major open source projects (Linux Kernel, Apache HTTP, etc.) found these projects to have a similar defect rate to analoguous commercial products (although commercial software defect rates are not made public). I am not surprised by this finding since these large institutional projects have professional developers (employed by major software companies like IBM and Oracle) working on them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is interesting about this article is that a new code analysis tool by Stanford University, called Prevent SQS, runs on a periodic basis and has discovered that bugs are being fixed at an extremely rapid rate. To quote the article:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A total of 7,826 defects have been identified and fixed through the Homeland Security review, or one every two hours since it was launched in 2006. Bugs and vulnerabilities have been found in most open source projects, which isn't surprising. What is surprising is the speed with which some projects resolve the issues as Coverity airs them on its Web site, versus other projects that lag behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;By putting vulnerabilities out in the open, a project with a large community is able to mobilize and respond to risks that users of the software are not willing to tolerate. However, commercial software products tend to be less open about their bugs and prioritize the addition of new features where they hope to achieve competitive advantage in acquiring new customers. That is not to say that these bugs do not get fixed. Anyone who has run a Microsoft IIS environment knows about all the security updates and packages you need to keep up with. However, the commercial patch probably comes &lt;i&gt;after&lt;/i&gt; the bug has been exploited on a customer installation and has become a customer relationship liability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content>

    <title>Portfolio Rot</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://cheezburger.com/7188809728"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.chzbgr.com/original/7188809728/hA53B422A/"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	Image Source: &lt;a href="http://failblog.cheezburger.com/thereifixedit"&gt;There I Fixed It&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://jakedimare.com/"&gt;Jake Dimare&lt;/a&gt;, over at &lt;a href="http://www.cmsmyth.com"&gt;The CMS Myth&lt;/a&gt;, has &lt;a href="http://www.cmsmyth.com/2013/04/so-you-say-you-want-a-content-management-system"&gt;a great post that speaks to the frustration that agencies feel after turning over websites to the incapable hands of their clients.&lt;/a&gt;  Back in my agency days I used to call this phenomenon "Portfolio Rot." It was so bad that we used to take screen captures of new sites before they started to look like something you would see on &lt;a href="http://failblog.cheezburger.com/thereifixedit"&gt;There I Fixed It.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;As bad as portfolio rot is for agencies, it is even more embarrassing customers.  The discomfort builds over time as the site degrades until it ultimately reaches a tipping point that triggers urgency and budget for an expensive overhaul project.  Tragically, the only thing that the project does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; fix is the underlying problem: lack of operational capacity.  At Lionbridge, we call the work of maintaining a site &lt;a href="http://www.globalmarketingops.com/"&gt;Global Marketing Operations&lt;/a&gt;. and I will be talking about all that goes into marketing operations at the upcoming &lt;a href="http://nowwhatconference.com/"&gt;Now What Conference&lt;/a&gt;.  I hope to see you there!&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Wikis Not Word! Gaining adoption through psychological warfare</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Your company has a perfectly good wiki but your (otherwise intelligent) co-workers insist on emailing you Microsoft Word documents to review.  Your gentle guidance has been ignored.  Your snarky comments have been equally ineffective.  What do you do?  I suggest the following method.  Try it (at your own risk) and let me know how it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A co-worker has sent you and four or five other colleagues a MS Word document that summarizes some research that he did.  The document contains some simple headings and paragraphs.  You have a lot of ideas and feedback to give but, rather than give it all at once, you trickle it out and have your co-worker feel the pain of merging your edits.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Draft 1: Re-Format&lt;/strong&gt;. Don't really change anything, just format the heck out of the document.  Change the styles around.  Send it back with a cryptic filename like [irrelevant name]_[your middle name]_final.doc.   Mail it with a note saying that it looks good and you had some slight wording changes.  Leave it up to your co-worker to figure out that nothing has really changed.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Draft 2: Re-Organize&lt;/strong&gt;.  A day after the first draft, take the &lt;em&gt;original document&lt;/em&gt; you received and re-organize it.    Re-order the sections and a few sentences here and there.  Make sure that you turn on "track changes" so that the whole document is a multi-hued mosaic of change notifications.   Name it [original filename]_new.doc. Send it with a note saying that you discussed it with another colleague and got some new ideas but "it is really coming along!"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Draft 3: Edit&lt;/strong&gt;.  This is the version where you provide your real feedback.  Start with your Draft 1.  Make your edits.  Name it [original filename].doc.  Send it with a note saying how excited you are about this project and have been "thinking about it non-stop."  Schedule a meeting to go over it and ask that your colleague send out a merged final draft for everyone's review. During the meeting, walk through everyone's feedback.   By this time, your colleague is probably totally fried and is ready for a new way of working.  At the end of the meeting, innocently say something like "you know, this might have been easier if we had worked in the wiki."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This method works even better if you have a co-conspiritor working with you doing the same thing.  During the process, watch out for signs of mental instability or fragility and remove all sharp objects from the office.  Make sure that the Employee Assistance Program posters are visible and well placed.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All humor aside, sometimes the only way to change people's ingrained behavior is to offer an alternative that is &lt;em&gt;substantially&lt;/em&gt; easier.  It has to be a big improvement because old habits are hard to break.  Starting to use a wiki can be hard for people accustomed to Microsoft Word.  They will initially get frustrated and resort to what they know.  If you can't eliminate the learning curve of a wiki, you can expose the inefficiency of collaborating without one.  The next time they launch Word, they will remember their painful experience and think twice.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>First Principles of Content Strategy</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Every organization should have a good hard look at their content strategy and bring in help if they need it.  However, doing any kind of content strategy work (using external or internal resources) is a waste of time without first establishing a solid foundation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your content strategy cannot succeed unless:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        &lt;h3&gt;You have information that a desirable audience wants&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to create content, you need information.  In order to create content that your target audience wants to consume, you need to have information that is of interest to them.  A steady stream of irrelevant press releases cannot be the basis for a good content strategy.  Neither is a random Twitter stream of links and retweets.  The good news is that any organization with customers (product purchasers, potential buyers, subscribers, members, etc.) probably has information that is of interest to them.  The challenge is figuring out what that information is, which requires an understanding of the audience.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        &lt;h3&gt;The information you have is capable of driving desired behaviors&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While your audience may find it intriguing, simply airing your dirty laundry isn't very strategic. For every bit of information you publish, think about expected and desired reponses.  If you work for a product company that has launched a new product, the content should contain information about who should buy the product and why.  If you have no information that would compel a customer to buy your product (that is, your product stinks), there is really nothing worth saying and no content strategy can solve that problem. Lying is a not a good content strategy.  If you have information about a defect in your product, the content you produce should support customer loyalty by resolving the issue. If publishing is your business, your content should establish your organization as the authority on this topic (and topics like it) so that the audience subscribes and/or returns.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;I call these the "First Principles of Content Strategy."  Any content strategy work should be grounded on these principles.  If you hire a content strategy consultant or staff an internal resource, testing these assertions first will help you start off on the right direction and save time.  If your answer to either of these assertions is "no," put that content strategy project on hold.  You have more pressing issues to address.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

For more information on the original report, read &lt;a href="http://contenthere.blogspot.com/2006/01/content-management-problems-and-open.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  Rather than try to republish the whole report, I am going to post updated reviews here.  The general concept is the same: group systems by how they are most frequently used.  Describe them in terms of Content Structure and Editing, Management, Presentation and Layout, Community and Support, Roadmap and Vision.  I also rate things like resources available.  The ratings are still in terms of below average (*), average (***), or above average(****).  I am also trying something with microformats in my brief assessments of the resources available.  Next up, will be Magnolia which I have been wanting to review for a long time.]&lt;table class="review-table"&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;th width="20%"&gt;&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th width="80%"&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td class="review-category"&gt;Version Reviewed&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td class="review-result"&gt;eZ publish version 3.8.3&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr &gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;td class="review-category"&gt;Most common use&lt;/td&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;td class="review-result"&gt;Informational Brochure Site&lt;/td&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;tr &gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;td class="review-category"&gt;Also used&lt;/td&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;td class="review-result"&gt;News site, eCommerce&lt;/td&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;tr &gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;td class="review-category"&gt;Architecture&lt;/td&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;td class="review-result"&gt;Lamp&lt;/td&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;td class="review-category"&gt;Organization&lt;/td&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;td class="review-result"&gt;Development controlled and supported by eZ systems&lt;/td&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;td class="review-category"&gt;License&lt;/td&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;td class="review-result"&gt;Dual GPL/Commercial&lt;/td&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;td class="review-category"&gt;Resources&lt;/td&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;td class="review-result"&gt;Books:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li class="hReview"&gt;&lt;span class="item"&gt;&lt;a class="url fn" href="http://ez.no/products/books/ez_publish_basics"&gt;eZ publish basics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.

The GPL and commercial licensed version of the software are identical.  Most end users can use the GPL version unless they intend to resell or OEM the software.  eZ publish has many reference sites including ecommerce, educational, interactive media, and corporate web sites. Development of the core product is closely managed by eZ Systems with the community contributing extensions and patches that may later be incorporated into the core product. eZ publish does not have the grassroots development community that Joomla!, TYPO3, and Drupal have.  Perhaps this is because this is a commercial open source project, not a community driven project. However, In addition to eZ systems, which licenses and supports the product, there is a large partner network that provides integration and training services. eZ systems is also having an impact on the general PHP community with their introduction of eZ components which competes with the new Zend Framework and more established frameworks such as Symfony and CakePHP as a standard framework for building PHP applications. If eZ components is successful, the population of developers that are familiar with the technology concepts behind eZ publish, such as the templating framework, will increase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Architecturally, eZ publish is well designed and extensible with a nice separation between business logic (implemented as modules) and presentation (implemented as views in eZ publish's templating language).  There is good support for pure content management features such as versioning, localization, and single sourcing.  In addition to the content module, which handles all the content management services, and other modules, such as the user module and the web shop module, developers can create custom modules to work within the framework.  The contributions section of the eZ systems website has a decent library of modules for free download.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The administrative user interface can be a little overwhelming for non-technical, un-initiated users.   This may be a reflection of eZ publish's purist approach to content management with notions of content classes and objects and node hierarchy, strong versioning, and translation.  The administrative interface definitely makes the user feel like he is managing an application rather than just editing a website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Content Structure and Editing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;eZ publish ships with several basic content types such as articles and various binary formats and as well as complex content types, such as a company (that could be used to support a feature like a partner directory) and a product. Content types can be defined at run time through the management UI by creating classes from attributes based on roughly 30 pre-defined datatypes (such as text, selection, xml block).  Each of these datatypes has an associated editing widget so the content editing forms are built dynamically based on the composition of the content type.  Certain datatypes can be designated as information collectors which allows a content class to represent form that external users can use to submit information (like a contact form).  Collected information is stored in the database and is accessible through the management UI where it can be exported to various text formats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The XML block datatype is used to store user formatted text for free-text areas.  &lt;br /&gt;Content stored in these attributes is actually stored an XML markup rather than plain HTML. For example, rather than using an &amp;lt;H1&amp;gt; HTML tag, eZ publish requires a user to use &amp;lt;heading level=â€1â€&amp;gt;. The Online Editor (now bundled with the basic eZ publish package) gives the user a WYSIWYG form control so he does not have to be aware of the XML based content behind the scenes.  There are a couple of trade-offs associated with this design.  On the negative side, it locks eZ publish into a single editor whereas other CMS can use any of several open source, or even&lt;br/&gt; closed-source editors.  Standard HTML editors allow the user to turn them off and paste complex HTML from other sources directly without an editor interpreting and possibly interfering with the original source.  Still, the Online Editor seems stable and handles pasted text reasonably well.  Also on the negative side, all this XML transformation may contribute to eZ publish's hunger for computing power.  On the positive side, storing content in more structured XML increases the system's understanding of and potential to reuse the content.  For example, eZ publish is aware of every link entered into an XML block field and has a features which checks for internal and external broken links.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In eZ publish, a page on a website has two components: the node or location, which places the content the site hierarchy; and the actual content object that stores the content.  This design allows a single piece of content to be used in several places on the website.  This feature is very useful for situations like having a news folder with all the news articles and then promoting certain articles on the home page.  Another use is to have content type which represents a "promotion" and placing that promo on different areas of the site.  Content objects are not associated to nodes until they are published.  This can be confusing because it means that unpublished pages do not appear on the page tree of the administrative interface.  They appear as drafts on the user's my drafts page. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Management&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;eZ publish does not support an in-site editing model where a user can navigate through the site and click on an icon to make an edit.  Instead, eZ publish has a management interface that is standard (although it can be modified, most customers do not) and is kept totally separate from the visitor facing website.  The management interface is what a system administrator would expect to see in an administrative interface: lots of control and an engineers logical view of the content.  However, this view goes over the head of a non-technical, untrained content author or editor.  There is the capability to turn off sections of the user interface but all those sections are really needed to navigate and edit the content.   If you deploy eZ publish, expect to train your non-technical users on a bit of content management theory and how to execute basic tasks.  Once the initial learning curve is conquered, they will probably appreciate the control that the UI affords. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The architecture of keeping the management interface separate from the visitor view is controlled by a system called "siteaccess."  Each siteaccess is a set of configurations that control what design is used and what content is being managed.  Typically, a website will have one siteaccess for the administration interface and another siteaccess for the visitor facing website.  These two siteaccesses share the same content but have a different design templates.  The same mechanism could be used to support several co-branded websites with the same content or several totally independent websites each with their own administrative interfaces.  Some of the major hosting companies that deal with eZ publish have many websites running on the same eZ publish instance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;eZ publish has a very strong versioning and translation system.  Each content object can have different versions (called "drafts" until they are "published" and "archived" if they are replaced by a newer published version).  Content can be rolled back by copying an older version forward and publishing the copied version.  By default, eZ publish will save 10 versions of a content object but that setting is configurable.  Each version can have one or more translations.  In this way, different translations of the same content object can be kept in sync.  Different language versions of the same website are controlled by the siteaccess framework in which a primary language and fall back languages are set.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;eZ publish comes with a very basic two-step workflow that can be extended by adding events (written in PHP) that affect the state of the asset and also can trigger additional functionality.  Extending workflow is generally considered one of the more challenging customizations to make in eZ publish.  Most customers stick with the basics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The eZ publish access control system is very powerful and secure.  Access is controlled by granting roles (bundles of policies which grant access with various limitations) to users or groups.  Policies can be associated to sections of the site or branches of the node hierarchy.  Groups can contain users or other sub groups.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Presentation and Layout&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the most easy to satisfy customers, the installation process includes a set of pre-built themes that can be modified through the UI (such as the type of navigation style, etc).  However, most customers (especially if they are using eZ publish for their corporate identity site) will want to do in depth customization to the presentation templates.  The method of doing this is to follow a model of template overrides.  When rendering a page, the templating engine looks in the design folders specified by the siteaccess for the appropriate template and then falls back to the standard design if the appropriate templates are not found.  Changing things like the overall page layout involves copying templates from the standard or other designs into the appropriate design folder and making modifications.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is also a system for creating rules that determine what templates are selected.  These rules can be based on the content type (or datatype), the section of the site, the original template that would have been used, or the individual node id.  The rules are defined in a configuration file.  Although the management interface theoretically could control these rules, it is so unusable that it is best to just edit the file.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The actual syntax that is used to develop templates is based on the &lt;a href="http://smarty.php.net/"&gt;Smarty PHP templating engine&lt;/a&gt;.  The general concepts and much of the syntax are similar but, at the time eZ systems was considering Smarty, it was too primitive for their needs so they pushed ahead with their own templating language.  Since that time both Smarty and eZ publishes templating system have evolved, sometimes in similar ways.  If a developer knows Smarty, eZ will look very familiar.  In fact, if you have Smarty based text highlighting rules in your text editor, they will work nicely with eZ publish templates.  The templating engine is also part of eZ components so it will compete with Smarty to be used in other open source projects or custom web applications.  The eZ publish templating framework rigidly separates layout from application logic.  There is no way to write PHP code in a "scriplet" as can be done with some other templating frameworks.  Anything resembling programming logic must be created as an "operator" which can be registered with the templating framework.  eZ ships with most of, if not all, the operators you need to build a site such as comparing values, converting strings, and extracting data from content objects.  Tags like "foreach" and "if" dictate control flow.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;eZ publish manages two sets of URLs: the system URL, which is of the format [module]/[view]/parameters (for example, /content/view/12 to view node 12) and the search engine friendly "virtual URLs" that are automatically managed by the system based on the name of the node (example: "/about") and manually managed by manual overrides (this is handy if you are migrating a site onto eZ publish and your URLs change).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The presentation supports three level of caching: view caching, template caching, and static caching.  View caching caches the output of the view (usually in the central well of the page), template caching stores compiled PHP code (generated from interpreting the templates) that is optimized by using "cache-block" statements in the page templates.  Static cache stores rendered static HTML on the file system&lt;br/&gt; for rapid access.  When you configure static cache, you tell it under what conditions to refresh the cache.  Additionally, eZ publish (for good reasons) recommends the use of a PHP accelerator, such as APC, that stores  PHP code in memory and greatly improves execution latency caused by disk I/O.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turning off caching (necessary if you are doing development) reveals why there is so much caching built into the architecture.  eZ publish is &lt;i&gt;slow&lt;/i&gt;.  Several factors contribute to this: the abstraction of the templating framework; conversion of XML blocks to HTML; the highly normalized and complex data model which supports user defined content classes, versioning, and translations; and the template override system.   Just because eZ publish is written in PHP, do not think that it can be run on an inexpensive $20 per month virtual Linux server.  &lt;br /&gt;Still, caching, plus eZ publishes support for clustering (enhanced in version 3.8) make eZ publish capable of supporting very high traffic websites. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Community and Support&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past few months, the documentation, especially for the 3.8 release has improved dramatically.  However, if you get stuck, the best place to start with an eZ publish question is the forums, which are extremely active and have a searchable archive. The lists are moderated, so almost all questions get answered, although sometimes there is a delay between the question and the answer. There are several extremely active forum contributors that are credited with hundreds of posts. eZ systems also leverages blogs and RSS for community outreach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently eZ systems has stepped up its presence in North America.  After establishing an office in Vancouver and seeding it with some senior staff, eZ systems is building its North American partner program with lots of outreach and programs including training and partner events.  eZ systems looks to partners for system implementation/integration work and bases its own revenue on support and value-add modules that it sells. eZ systems sells a network product that can be installed on a production instance to check for compliance, monitor its health, send updates, and be used by eZ systems support for issue diagnosis.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Roadmap/Vision&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;eZ systems follows a release schedule of every 6 months.  The most recent release was mostly architectural including better support for clustering.  The next major release will be more features based.  eZ publish still does not support PHP 5 and there are no immediate plans to do so.  However, this is not so much of a problem as eZ systems employs one of the top committers on the 4.x PHP series.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Hosting a CMS Panel at CMS Expo</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;On May 8th, I will be hosting a panel at &lt;a href="http://cmsexpo.net"&gt;CMS Expo&lt;/a&gt; called "&lt;a href="http://cmsexpo.net/sessions/2-152-CMS_Review___Compare_CMSs_For_Web_Design_Studios_&amp;_Development_Firms"&gt;CMS Review - Compare CMSs For Web Design Studios &amp; Development Firms&lt;/a&gt;."  The panel is designed to help web design and development shops build their CMS portfolios.  Selecting the right platforms to take to market is extremely important because building competency with these technologies takes time and your projects are risky until you do.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the panel, we will be focusing on the topics most relevant to studios and integrators:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The types of sites that the platform is best suited for.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Market awareness in industry verticals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Availability and quality of training and support.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;This session would also be useful for an internal services group that does web design and development projects for departments within the organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;I will be around pretty much the whole conference.  Look for me if you want to chat about CMS selection, localization, or marketing operations.  If you haven't registered yet, use the code Seth2012 for a 10% off discount.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Whatever happened to the URL?</title>
    <content type='html'>Even back when I was developing websites in 1998, it was considered really amateur to use frames.   One of the primary arguments against using frames is that they mess up book marking (that, and they cause the back button to behave inconsistently).  The browser does not know which frame within the frameset you are interested in.  When you reload the page, the frameset reloads to its default state.  The only way to get back is to re-enact the sequence of actions that took you to that view. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The single most important thing about the web is the URL.  The URL is a resource's identity on the web.  It is the magic behind links.   It is your only way to get back to where you were.  Without URL's the interconnected web melts into a de-referenced puddle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why are there so many new web technologies disrespecting URL based navigation?   AJAX is actually not so bad as long as you use it for targeted functionality and give the user an alternative link based navigation.  But &lt;a href="http://java.sun.com/javaee/javaserverfaces/"&gt;JSF&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flash/flashpro/"&gt;Flash&lt;/a&gt; based web applications really annoy me.  Applications built on these technologies seem to have abandoned the concept of the web and are just using a browser as a runtime environment.  That may be OK if you think of the web as just an efficient software deployment tool but it is &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; OK if you want your application to behave as a node in an interconnected network.   With content, especially web content but also documents, it is &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;absolutely essential &lt;/span&gt;that each asset is referenceable.  Referenceable content allows for very easy integration across systems.  For example, you can link to an item in your Digital Records Management system from within your Customer Relationship Management system so a user is able to see an invoice that a customer complained about.  This is the ultimate in loosely coupled architectures.  With WYSIWYG editor, a very non-technical business user is able to create all sorts of aggregated views of content.   Why even bother with a web services API if you can't even do this?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you are like me and you believe that the Internet, &lt;a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/oreilly/tim/news/2005/09/30/what-is-web-20.html"&gt;Web 2.0&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/"&gt;Semantic Web&lt;/a&gt; is all about making connections with content, stay away from technologies and uses of technologies that undermine the linkages.</content>

    <title>Vendor risk</title>
    <content type='html'>Back in 2004 (I still can't believe that I have been blogging that long!) I wrote a &lt;a href="http://blog.contenthere.net/2004/12/cms-exit-strategies.html"&gt;post that discussed the risk of buying into a web content management software market that seemed on the verge of a consolidation&lt;/a&gt;.  A few months later I wrote another post about the &lt;a href="http://blog.contenthere.net/2005/01/mid-market-cms.html"&gt;attractiveness and potential risk of mid-market products that were innovating with a much greater pace than the upper tier vendors&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That consolidation hasn't happened and I am not sure if it ever will.  There is still a concern about product continuity but it may be that the upper market products are riskier than the middle tier.  Just look at events like the &lt;a href="http://www.opentext.com"&gt;OpenText&lt;/a&gt; acquisition of RedDot, &lt;a href="http://www.oracle.com"&gt;Oracle's&lt;/a&gt; acquisition of Stellent, and constant speculation about other upper tier companies.  I am telling my clients to watch out for "portfolio" style software "enterprise software" companies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Portfolio companies collect software products - usually by acquisition.  They used to offer the promise of integrating their products into nice cohesive solutions but those solutions have (for the most part) not materialized.  Their failure to build integrated solutions was not from incompetence; software integration was never the goal.  These companies were looking to integrate customer bases, not technology.  The problem with a portfolio company is that its strategy for a software product line can be at odds with the best interest of its customers.  If a portfolio company has redundant or unprofitable products, it will try to eliminate them.  Oracle doesn't want to own three portals.  OpenText doesn't want to manage three WCM platforms.  It wants to find a winner and slowly starve the rest.  One day &lt;a href="http://blog.contenthere.net/2008/03/serena-finally-has-plan-for-collage.html"&gt;Serena decided that they didn't want to be in the web content management business&lt;/a&gt;.  Because they have plenty of other products to sell, they could afford to lose interest in Collage.  History tells us that the risk of a large company discontinuing a product is far greater than a medium size company going out of business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My new advice is to be careful of companies that have a habit of acquiring products.  If you become their customer, they might lose interest in the product that you bought and they probably will not integrate their disparate portfolio into a well integrated solution.  Nevertheless, if you look at your requirements and you find that the &lt;em&gt;best fit&lt;/em&gt; happens to be a portfolio product (the actual software today - not the promised integrated vision), you should still buy it.  Just mitigate your risk by keeping the pay-off horizon below four years and having a good exit strategy.  To quote myself from 2004:  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Plan an exit strategy as part of the selection. Look for open standards and interoperability that will make the solution substitutable, wholly or in part. Make sure that your content is does not get locked up in proprietary formats. Stick with technologies that you feel comfortable supporting. Spread your bets. Your content will outlive any technology choice you make today. Plan for it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That way, no matter what your software vendor does, your risks will be contained.  &lt;br /&gt;</content>

    <title>Wachovia &amp;quot;Content Access Services&amp;quot; Case Study</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.gilbane.com/case_studies/wachovia_case_study.html"&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; case study by Gilbane's Content Technology Works (CTW), other than being an advertisement for IBM, shows a successful execution of a content integration strategy.  The client is Wachovia, a very large financial services company (4th in the US), that grew out of acquisitions and, consequently, had several document repositories based on different technologies: IBM ImagePlus, FileNet, and Mobius.  Libraries of digitized forms and documents are a huge deal in financial services companies because they need to keep every interaction with their customers at hand for customer service and regulatory reasons.  As an aside, I once had a client that knew they had to do something major with imaging when the weight of their paper archives started to bow the floors and break the windows of their building.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to integrate the business operations of the merged companies, Wachovia employees needed to work with information about their customers from multiple sources.  Projects requests started surfacing about building desktop applications that integrated customer information from multiple departments.  Rather than trying to migrate all the content over into one system, Wachovia started building a common content access layer with adaptors for different document management systems.  The core technology they used was IBM's DB2 Information Integrator Content Edition which already came with a FileNet adaptor.  Wachovia also built new adaptors for ImagePlus and Mobius and then added their own XML-based API to insulate Wachovia's client applications from the Information Integrator API.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From reading the case study a couple of really good decisions stand out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rather than adopt a strategy of migrating all content into a single system such as FileNet, Wachovia chose an integration approach where heterogeneous systems could coexist.  This makes sense for several reasons:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;It is cheaper.&lt;/b&gt; Migrating terrabytes of content from one format to another has a huge up front cost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;It leverages existing investments.&lt;/b&gt; Not just licensing but also customization, integration and training.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;It is lower risk.&lt;/b&gt; Wachovia does not have to bet the business on one technology.  There is so much volatility in the marketplace that no one knows what is going to be a market leader and what will fall behind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;It allows best of breed selection.&lt;/b&gt; Different groups may have different needs that are best satisfied with different technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rather than have their client applications access the Information Aggregator API directly, Wachovia added an abstraction layer.  This will enable Wachovia to more easily swap out Information Aggregator if a better technology comes along.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all, I think this is an excellent approach to the vision of "Enterprise Content Management."  It is practical, cost effective and reduces dependency on a single provider.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Selecting a CMS with Narratives</title>
    <content type='html'>I just ran across this &lt;a href="http://www.steptwo.com.au/papers/cmb_narrativetender/index.html"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; by James Robertson of &lt;a href="http://www.steptwo.com.au"&gt;StepTwo Designs&lt;/a&gt;.  The general point is that the best way to convey the requirements for a product is to create a narrative that describes the business need for the system.  I like this strategy.  It is a refreshing departure from the typical "column fodder" technique where customers create feature matrices to compare products.  In addition to keeping focus on the business need, which is always a good thing, I think this technique breaks what I think are dysfunctional buying and selling habits created by checklist based selection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the buying side, putting a feature on a checklist makes an assumption that the feature (and the way it has been implemented) will solve a particular business problem.  This assumption can be incorrect because there may be better ways to solve the problem.  For example, auditing may be a more effective way of keeping a history of changes than versioning.  Or, the feature may be implemented in such a way that it is unusable to the users.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I think that matrix buying leads to bad products as well.  To compete, product companies need to be able to "check-off" certain features.  This can either lead to marketing overstating functionality of the product or, worse, products growing un-useful features for checklist coverage.  Having the most features does not make a product the best.  Not only is there a tendency toward diminishing returns, there comes a point where additional features actually reduce the utility of the product by making it overly complicated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So what do you do with narratives?  State &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; your users need to do,  and challenge your vendor to show &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; that goal would be satisfied with their product.  If there is a disconnect (and there will be most of the time) have a dialog about how the product can be modified.  Better yet, talk about how other customers have used the product to meet a similar need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The narrative technique seems less quantitative than the matrix method.  However, I think that these matrices are always less scientific than they seem.  Focusing on narratives (both of the problem and the solution) is more work for both the buyer and the seller because they have to communicate a lot more.  More importantly, the business users are more involved.  They can visualize using the solution in their context.  Just remember to control the natural desire for bright shiny objects.</content>

    <title>The Apogee Project</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;French systems integrator, &lt;a href="http://www.nuxeo.com"&gt;Nuxeo&lt;/a&gt;, makers of &lt;a href="http://www.cps-project.org"&gt;CPS&lt;/a&gt;, just announced a new project called &lt;a href="http://apogee.nuxeo.org/"&gt;Apogee&lt;/a&gt;.  Apogee is an &lt;a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/index.php/Rich_Client_Platform"&gt;Eclipse RCP&lt;/a&gt; based thick client for ECM systems such as &lt;a href="http://www.cps-project.org"&gt;CPS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.documentum.com/"&gt;Documentum&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.interwoven.com"&gt;Interwoven&lt;/a&gt;.  I think this project has a lot of potential.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First of all, although everyone loves a web based client, there are some structural limitations of using a browser to manage files.  For security reasons, browsers are designed to have very limited interaction with the underlying file system.  Signed applets and ActiveX controls can circumvent this security system but users need to know what to trust and what not to trust.  An installed thick client avoids this issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Training is a key issue in rolling out any content management system.  If you can standardize on a UI, you may be able to lower your switching costs from one ECM product to another.  Most ECM products have standardized on Windows Explorer as the interface by exposing the repository as a file share.  However, this model has its limitations because Windows Explorer does not expose metadata and other functionality that makes an ECM system more than just a file system.  There are work arounds.  For example, &lt;a href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/"&gt;Tortoise SVN&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.tortoisecvs.org/"&gt;Tortoise CVS&lt;/a&gt; both give right click menu options for source control functions such as dif, check out, commit, and history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those who are not familar with Eclipse or Eclipse RCP, Eclipse is mostly used as an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for building Java applications.   However, it is designed as a framework for building many different other kinds of applications.  Many big companies (such as &lt;a href="http://www.ibm.com"&gt;IBM&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.bea.com"&gt;BEA&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.borland.com"&gt;Borland&lt;/a&gt;) that have their own IDE's contribute heavily to Eclipse.  The idea is that there is core functionality that is common to many different kinds of business applications (navigation, editing interfaces, different views).  Eclipse supports these basic services and the actual business applications are implemented as plugins.  &lt;a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/index.php/Rich_Client_Platform"&gt;RCP&lt;/a&gt; is the core for building these plugins.  For example, the open source reporting tool &lt;a href="http://www.eclipse.org/birt/phoenix/"&gt;BIRT&lt;/a&gt; is implemented on Eclipse RCP.  If you can get Eclipse installed on your users machines, rolling out Apogee and BIRT is very simple thanks to the Eclipse plugin manager. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will be interesting to see if the major proprietary ECM vendors get behind this initiative.  They could take the view that Eclipse contributing companies do: cooperate to reduce the cost of the delivering the basic core functionality and compete on the value-add differentiators.  Somehow, I don't think that the big ECM vendors will have this perspective.  One can always hope though.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Fun with static publishing</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;In the old days, static publishing (or baking, where the CMS generates static HTML files at publish time), was pretty much the standard.  Most of the WCM products on the market did static publishing: Interwoven, Tridion, RedDot, Percussion .... Even the frying systems like Vignette and FatWire (FutureTense/OpenMarket back then) relied so heavily on caching that they were practically baking style systems.  Computing power was so expensive back then that you didn't dare to do much processing at request time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then frying-style systems became the norm.  WCM vendors needed to have an answer to market demand for personalization and other dynamic behavior and the only way to do that was through dynamic (request-time) publishing.  But static publishing isn't dead.  There are many baking style systems on the market and lots of customers swear by static publishing. &lt;a href="http://www.slideshare.net/sggottlieb/web-content-management-system-deployment-patterns"&gt;Good strategies have emerged to overcome its limitations&lt;/a&gt;.  The primary benefits of static publishing are still very real: cost-savings, security, and stability.  You can cheaply stand-up web servers that have the easy job of just serving up static HTML files.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And this brings me to my little obsession with static publishing.  I am hosting a few sites on Amazon S3.  The cost is ridiculously low and the speed is crazy-fast.  Publishing them is fun too.  For example, I publish my little personal site (&lt;a href="http://www.sethgottlieb.com"&gt;www.sethgottlieb.com&lt;/a&gt;) using a site generator called &lt;a href="https://github.com/blog/342-hyde-the-python-static-site-generator"&gt;Hyde&lt;/a&gt;, which is a Python port of a Ruby-based system called &lt;a href="http://jekyllrb.com/"&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;.  The way these generators work is that you enter your content in  HTML, &lt;a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/"&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt;, or some other syntax and then run a script that renders static HTML pages with your presentation templates.  Presentation templates can also do useful things like create listing pages.  The Hyde sample site has a blog and there is a script to migrate from Wordpress.  Versioning? Git, of course.  In fact, using a source code control system will also allow multiple authors to collaborate too. Site generators also do useful things like minifying your CSS and JS files for maximum performance.  Want interactive features like search or commenting?  For search you could use Google Custom Search.  Commenting can be supported through a service like Disqus.  You can configure secure areas with your web servers.  For little bits of interactivity, you could embed some client side Javascript or server side PHP in your static HTML files.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also used static publishing to create an archive of a site that I no longer update.  I created a Drupal website for my wife's birthday a few years ago.  I didn't want to pay for LAMP hosting indefinitely but I didn't want to lose the site either.  My solution was to pull the whole site down using &lt;a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/"&gt;wget&lt;/a&gt; and then upload it to S3.  The site has lots of pages and I wouldn't want to manage them as static HTML but since I have no plans to change the site, I don't have to worry about it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am not saying that static publishing is a good idea all or even most of the time.  Dynamic publishing opens up a whole new word of interactivity and personalization.  Just don't write off static publishing too quickly &amp;mdash; especially if your site doesn't change much and doesn't need to be very interactive.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Good Article on Web Application Security Vulnerabilities</title>
    <content type='html'>The &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; programming language has historically gotten a bad rap in the area of security. While the language itself has had some vulnerabilities, three other aspects have (in my opinion) played a larger role:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_1"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; is an easy language to learn so there are a lot of unsophisticated beginners with no awareness of security holes writing web applications on it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;The rise of &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_2"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; coincided with a rise in community content applications (bulletin boards, blogs, Nukes) where external, untrusted users could insert their own content with potentially malicious payloads.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;The &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_3"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; programming community was a little late in adopting web application frameworks. Good frameworks provide the plumbing for a web application and take care of security holes so that the custom code that developers write doesn't have to worry as much about known hacker exploits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two of these three factors are rapidly changing. The &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_4"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; development community is getting more sophisticated from a technology perspective and frameworks are getting better and are becoming more commonly used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I am seeing more and more articles concerning security on &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_5"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; developer websites and magazines. For example, there is a &lt;a href="http://ez.no/community/articles/dangers_of_csrf_and_xss"&gt;really good article&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href="http://ez.no/"&gt;&lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_6"&gt;eZ&lt;/span&gt; publish&lt;/a&gt; site about Cross Site Request Forgery (&lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_7"&gt;CSRF&lt;/span&gt;) and Cross Site Scripting (&lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_8"&gt;XSS&lt;/span&gt;). It goes over how a hacker can inject malicious code into your site and how to protect yourself against these attacks. Here is a hint... never trust anything that a user enters. For more reading, check out Rob Miller's &lt;a href="http://php.robm.me.uk/"&gt;&lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_9"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; Security Guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you have been holding back on using a framework, I would reconsider. Most of the &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_10"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; frameworks have filter components (The &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_11"&gt;Zend&lt;/span&gt; Framework has their &lt;a href="http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.filter.html"&gt;&lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_12"&gt;Zend&lt;/span&gt;_Filter&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="http://ez.no/ezcomponents"&gt;&lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_13"&gt;eZ&lt;/span&gt; components&lt;/a&gt; has a &lt;a href="http://ez.no/doc/components/view/latest/%28file%29/classtrees_UserInput.html"&gt;User Input component&lt;/a&gt;) that disarms potentially hazardous user input. Tapping into the collective intelligence about security can free your own mind to building better, more effective web applications.</content>

    <title>Jahia Community Edition V6 Available</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.jahia.com"&gt;Jahia&lt;/a&gt; has some big news.  As of today, V6 of their Community Edition is now available.  This is a big release for Jahia on a number of levels.  Architecturally, they have refactored the application to make it cleaner by removing &lt;a href="http://portals.apache.org/jetspeed-2/"&gt;Jetspeed-2&lt;/a&gt; from the architecture.  JSR 286 portlets are still supported through the &lt;a href="http://portals.apache.org/pluto/"&gt;Apache Pluto portlet container&lt;/a&gt;.  More importantly, they have developed a framework for "pluggable repositories" where Jahia can now connect to content providers like a JCR or a file system (see screenshot).  A new rules engine can be configured to do different actions on content depending on its type.  For example: unzip an archive when it is uploaded.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/38298452@N00/3251384576" title="View 'Jahia 6 File Manager' on Flickr.com"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3389/3251384576_6f4a436826.jpg" alt="Jahia 6 File Manager" border="0" width="500" height="437" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Jahia 6 File Manager has a Outlook-style tabbing scheme that allows you to browse multiple repositories&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of new contributor features such as improved workflow, inline editing, and a preview feature where you can emulate preview for a specific user type on a specific date (see screenshot).  There is also image cropping and scaling functionality built in.  From a usability perspective, Jahia has aggressively adopted &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/"&gt;Google Web Toolkit (GWT)&lt;/a&gt; to AJAX-ify the user interface.  There are now fewer popups and many other subtle improvements that lead to better user flow. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/38298452@N00/3250607329" title="View 'Jahia 6 &amp;quot;Preview as&amp;quot;' on Flickr.com"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3387/3250607329_a02d697381.jpg" alt="Jahia 6 &amp;quot;Preview as&amp;quot;" border="0" width="500" height="266" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jahia 6 preview feature allows a contributor to emulate a specific user type and date.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest changes in Jahia 6 has to do with the licensing.  Readers of my &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/products-page/reports/open-source-web-content-management-in-jahia"&gt;Jahia 5 evaluation&lt;/a&gt; know that I have been quite hard on Jahia for talking so much about open source but not offering a single open source product (their Community Edition had a non-OSI-certified badgeware license).  Well, as of V6, Jahia Community Edition is licensed under the &lt;a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html"&gt;GPL (V2)&lt;/a&gt;.  Version 6 of the commercially licensed Enterprise Edition (due out this summer) is also going to have some licensing changes but I don't want to spoil the surprise.  For now, you can try out the supportable, open source licensed Community Edition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>XSL - Your Next Templating Language?</title>
    <content type='html'>When you implement a web content management system, you usually do most of the development on the presentation tier.  Expect to spend 2/3 to 3/4 of your development time working on page templates.  (Also expect to spend double what you expect in content migration but that is the topic of &lt;a href="http://contenthere.blogspot.com/2006/10/migrating-content.html"&gt;another post&lt;/a&gt;).  That is where you define the page layouts, the formatting of the content, and other visitor facing behavior.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have implemented a number of WCM products, you know that most have have their own proprietary templating syntax or at least their own set of tags to use.  After a while you begin to realize that while the syntax varies, the core concepts are  common.  Most are designed on the assumption that a dynamic web page is actually mostly static with a few dynamic regions embedded within. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a result, the page template is mostly static HTML with a bit of code to retrieve and display dynamic content in the defined regions.  The proprietary tags (be they JSP tag libraries, XML tags, or scriptable objects) encapsulate the work of finding, retrieving, and formatting content from the underlying repository.  Some templating systems are stricter than others about keeping business logic out of the template code and forcing that logic to be embedded in more reusable objects.  For example, in the Java world, &lt;a href="http://freemarker.sourceforge.net/"&gt;FreeMarker&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://velocity.apache.org/"&gt;Velocity&lt;/a&gt; deliberately limit what can be done in a presentation template.  JSP, with its ability to embed any Java code scriptlets, puts developers on the honor system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this delineation, server side developers and web designers are able to keep from treading on each others toes.  There is a long standing process for implementing the presentation tier that goes like this:  graphic designers create page mockups in something like Adobe Photoshop; creative developers code the mockup in statich HTML (or DHTML); and then the server side developer embeds the objects and tags to replace the static example text and pictures with dynamic content.  Some templating syntaxes are supported by HTML editors (such as DreamWeaver) to facilitate round trips between server side developers and HTML developers.  With the appropriate plugins you can get code completion and other conveniences.  Zope's Tag Attribute Language (TAL) is nice because it does everything in extended attributes within regular HTML tags and that reduces the chances that the HTML editor will scramble the dynamic code.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The common patterns, tool support, and the fact that you can orient yourself in the code by reading through the familiar HTML, make the traditional templating systems relatively easy to learn.  It's a great system that the majority of the industry has embraced.  It's great, I should say, until those bits that you expected to be static and unchanging start to change.  To make matters worse, they become variable in unexpected ways: by exception.  All of the sudden, someone from the business side wants to do a "small change just on a few pages."  Or it might be a global change like when a new browser comes out and HTML tricks that you used to be able to get away with start breaking pages.  Of course, these changes are urgent and need to be done yesterday.  You put in a hack like a temporary template expecting to fix it later.  However, you know that later you will be responding to some other urgent change.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if you are clever about using server side includes, macros and other best practices, unless you constantly refactor your template code and actively manage the presentation tier, you will start to experience template proliferation.  At first, this seems like an acceptable price to pay for the ease of development.  Having lots of templates may not seem like such a problem if they are easy to read and edit.  For companies with small to medium sites and modest pressure to make special feature layouts, this might be totally acceptable.  But for large media sites with lots of content and lots of editors, things get out of control.  One of my clients had 7,000 templates.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An alternative strategy is to use XSLT.  Unlike traditional web templating technologies, XSL templates build the whole page dynamically as a result tree and fragments can be overridden in a CSS kind of way (not exactly, but you get the idea).  So, if you want to override a section of static HTML markup in one area on the page,   in one section of the site, you do not have to write an alternative template out include that is identical but for that one difference.  The die-hard JSP guys out there are thinking "I wouldn't do that, I would write conditional logic around that little fragment."  You could.  But that makes the JSP harder to read and manage.  Think about how easy it is to have a media specific CSS style sheet for a print-only view that does a "display:none" for all the HTML classes and IDs that you don't want on the print version.  Contrast that with writing a bunch of JSP "if" statements around screen only HTML.    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not think that XSLT is all light and happiness.  There are several limitations that may rule out XSLT for you.  For example, XSL has nowhere near the tool support that traditional HTML based templating languages have.  Forget about WYSIWYG editors.    There are a couple of them out there but they are nowhere near as good as straight HTML editors.  Most HTML programmers get totally lost in XSL code.  XSL processors have traditionally been slower than other presentation systems that are optimized for request time response.  There are a couple of WCM systems that use XSL (commercial products like &lt;a href="http://www.ingeniux.com/"&gt;Ingeniux&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.hannonhill.com/"&gt;Hannon Hill&lt;/a&gt; and the open source WCM &lt;a href="http://lenya.apache.org"&gt;Apache Lenya&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;a href="http://www.alfresco.com"&gt;Alfresco&lt;/a&gt; has an XSL templating option), but as one sales engineer said, they have had to sell &lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;around&lt;/span&gt; this aspect of the product rather than highlight it.  Writing dynamic, request time logic for something like personalization is harder on a presentation tier built on XSLT.  &lt;a href="http://cocoon.apache.org"&gt;Apache Cocoon&lt;/a&gt; is an XML web application framework designed to address this limitation but, for some reason, it has not getting a lot of attention lately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, I think that the tide is shifting on XSLT and here is why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Layout is now more driven by CSS.  This does two things.  First of all, the HTML is getting much simpler (no more nested tables for positioning) and semantically meaningful so the XSL will need to do less work.  Second, the declarative style of CSS is similar to XSL so HTML programmers are more prepared to think in this way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;With all of interest in AJAX, HTML developers are starting to get more comfortable with XML.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;XSL processors are getting faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Also thanks to AJAX, you can have a statically deployed ("baked") HTML website with dynamic AJAX components layered in.  Baking style presentation tiers are especially appropriate for XSLT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;XML is becoming increasingly popular for data exchange and storage.  You can't go to a content management conference without hearing the term XML in every presentation.  Even large companies like &lt;a href="http://contenthere.net"&gt;Content Here&lt;/a&gt; are using XML for content authoring :).  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Better browser support for XML may make client side XSLT rendering a reality soon.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Architects are looking for standards and de-coupled architectures to reduce lock-in.  Just as the JCR or any other standards based repository presents flexibility and an exit strategy, a presentation tier that uses XSLT will make it cheaper to move to another platform.  All you need to do is get another platform that publishes XML and your page templates will still work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Depending on your need&lt;br/&gt;s, XSLT may not be appropriate for your architecture.  But if you are searching for a presentation tier to address problems in template proliferation and poor separation between business and display logic, you might consider it.</content>

    <title>J. Boye: Philadelphia 2009</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.jboye.com/conferences/philadelphia09/"&gt;The conference schedule for J. Boye Philadelphia 2009 (May 5th-7th)&lt;/a&gt; is taking shape nicely.  The J. Boye team has added several case studies to make it a true "user conference" just like the J. Boye conferences in Denmark that I have raved about in the past.  Expert speakers include &lt;a href="http://www.jboye.com/conferences/philadelphia09/speakers/david_pogue"&gt;David Pogue&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.jboye.com/conferences/philadelphia09/speakers/lou_rosenfeld"&gt;Lou Rosenfeld&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.jboye.com/conferences/philadelphia09/speakers/lisa_welchman"&gt;Lisa Welchman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.jboye.com/conferences/philadelphia09/speakers/martin_white"&gt;Martin White&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.jboye.com/conferences/philadelphia09/speakers/tony_byrne"&gt;Tony Byrne&lt;/a&gt;.  J. Boye takes great care to keep the tone of the conference un-salesy and encourage a candid exchange of information.  To keep the conversation going after the sessions end each day, there are also three social events: the Conference Dinner (May 5th), the Conference Party (May 6th) and the Farewell Dinner (May 7th).  If you are coming in from overseas you also might want to attend the "Jetlag Reception" on Monday May 4th.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the early bird special is no longer available, you can use the coupon code "sgphilly" to get 15% off the list price.  If you work for a non-profit, you can probably get a better discount by contacting the&lt;a href="mailto:info@jboye.com"&gt; J. Boye team&lt;/a&gt; directly.  I hope to see you there!&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Book Review: OpenCms 7 Development</title>
    <content type='html'>I just got through reading Dan Liliedahl's book &lt;a href="http://www.packtpub.com/opencms-7-development/book"&gt;OpenCms 7 Development&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://www.packtpub.com/"&gt;Packt Publishing&lt;/a&gt;).  I met Dan when I was at the &lt;a href="http://www.opencms-days.org/en/index.html"&gt;OpenCms Days&lt;/a&gt; developer conference and was impressed with his presentation.  Dan knows his stuff (not just about &lt;a href="http://www.opencms.org"&gt;OpenCms&lt;/a&gt; - he worked for FutureTense in the early days).  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The book was first introduced at the conference.  I was surprised that Dan was able to get it out so quickly after Version 7 was released.  It seemed like Version 6 was out a long time before a book on it came out.  Dan did mention that writing about the product as it was being developed was a challenge.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I started reading the book, I was pleasantly surprised to not have to go through any content management theory.  The book stays true to its title.  Not that theory isn't important but I think it is reasonable to assume that someone developing on a CMS knows the about the basic concepts.  If you don't, some background reading (and also some requirements analysis too) is in order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One short-coming about diving right into the OpenCms architecture is that the beginning is a little choppy as the author tries to orient the reader to the platform (OpenCms is a very mature and elaborate application).  Although it is choppy, there are some very good explanations of things like OpenCms's request processing chain and how the code is organized.  There are also excellent tips on configuration management and how to configure your IDE.  Still a reader may want to supplement the book by reading some additional OpenCms doc to help introduce him to some of the bigger OpenCms concepts. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The book hits its stride as it gets into the examples, which revolve around building a blogging site.  There is good coverage on everything from creating content types and display templates to building extensions.  By over-engineering some of the design, Dan is able to go into depth in modularizing code and managing logic in Java classes.   Dan's experience in building big sites shows in how he designs for manageability and reuse.  All the code is put into modules that can be exported and deployed to different OpenCms instances.  The book also covers some of the new features like WebDAV, the new security model (with organizational units) and the relationship engine.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one area that I think could use a little more coverage is on the TemplateOne and TemplateTwo frameworks.  Dan builds everything from scratch to show how OpenCms works but these frameworks allow you to get up an running with less development.  Unfortunately, neither of these are particularly well covered in the OpenCms documentation.  Perhaps a whole book on TemplateOne and TemplateTwo is in order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, OpenCms 7 Development is a must read for anyone who wants to implement robust sites on the OpenCms platform.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OpenCms is covered in the&lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/products-page/reports/open-source-content-management-in-java"&gt; Open Source Web Content Management in Java report&lt;/a&gt;.  The &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/products-page/reports/open-source-web-content-management-in-opencms"&gt;standalone evaluation of OpenCms is also available&lt;/a&gt;.</content>

    <title>Honest Open Source</title>
    <content type='html'>I just read Kris Buytaert's blog post &lt;a href="http://krisbuytaert.be/blog/node/612"&gt;"Honest Open Source"&lt;/a&gt;, which talks about how customers can trust open source consultants to recommend suitable software because, unlike commercial software, there are no incentives for selling licenses.  His point balances on the fact that most open source products do not have partner programs to pay consultants when they implement the solution.  While some open source companies use other methods of encouraging their partners to recommend their products[1], the business influence over technical decisions is certainly less than in commercial software.  You may remember the case of &lt;a href=http://www.cmswatch.com/Trends/1010-Uncle-Sam-cracks-down-on-vendor-selection-abuse"&gt;Accenture taking kick-backs while having the Department of Justice pay them for a "Vendor Neutral" product selection&lt;/a&gt;.  With millions of dollars of licensing revenue at stake, scruples are going to be tested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, even without kick-backs, people have their biases.  Developers like to use software that they know.  Working with known technologies improves efficiency and reduces risk.  When you are doing a fixed bid proposal, this is very important.  I pretty much beat this point to death &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2007/09/the-importance-of-vendor-neutrality.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  Most of the open source consultants that I know are affiliated with a project on both a business and an emotional level.  At a business level, most of their work is associated with the project.  On an emotional level, they believe in the community and the software. They are usually pretty candid about their connection and position their opinions accordingly but sometimes the passion gets in the way.  You could say, bias through passion is more honest than bias through reward but to the customer it is still bias.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice is to talk to different companies and accept their partiality.  Have them defend their opinions and disclose their affiliations.  I find that talking to the consultants that will be staffed on the project is the best way to get a straight answer. They know better than to over-promise on the technology platform because they are going to be around when the truth is revealed.  It is going to be their fault if implementing a feature turns out to be difficult and they will be left holding the bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[1] Readers of &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/products-page/reports/open-source-content-management-in-java"&gt;Open Source Web Content Management in Java&lt;/a&gt; know about these strategies.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content>

    <title>Goodbye ZServer, Hello Twisted</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.eshea.net/index.html"&gt;Eric Shea&lt;/a&gt; just passed on &lt;a href="http://uk.builder.com/programming/python/0,39030014,39292462,00.htm"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; describing how &lt;a href="http://www.zope.org/DevHome/Wikis/DevSite/Projects/ComponentArchitecture/FrontPage"&gt;Zope3&lt;/a&gt; is dumpinjg the old ZServer and go with &lt;a href="http://twistedmatrix.com/"&gt;The Twisted Framework&lt;/a&gt; for its web server. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those of you unfamiliar with the Zope platform, ZServer is ancient, slow and not too secure.  The security part is not so much of a problem because any serious Zope 2.x installation is going to sit behind an Apache web server.  Twisted, on the other hand is a high performance framework for building Python applications.  We did a prototype based on Twisted as part of a proposal for a very high traffic web service and our experience with it has been very positive.  You may also notice the last name of one of the Twisted project team (Lefkowitz).  &lt;a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/glyf/"&gt;Glyph&lt;/a&gt; is the son of r0ml, our former VP, Research and Executive Education.  I am pretty sure that the Lefkowitz family enforces a strict nickname policy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Bluenog subtly forks Hippo</title>
    <content type='html'>I was catching up on my blog reading and noticed a few &lt;a href="http://www.cmswire.com/cms/enterprise-cms/bluenog-launches-integrated-collaboration-environment-003149.php"&gt;announcements&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;a href="http://www.bluenog.com/"&gt;Bluenog's&lt;/a&gt; new integrated suite offering &lt;a href="http://bluenog.com/site/products"&gt;ICE&lt;/a&gt;.    I knew that Bluenog was a preferred US Hippo CMS integrator (before &lt;a href="http://blog.contenthere.net/2008/03/one-hippo.html"&gt;Hippo opened a U.S. office&lt;/a&gt;) and it made me wonder if their platform was based on Hippo (despite the fact of not mentioning it).  Sure enough, Bluenog CMS is a direct fork of Hippo.  Hippo's permissive Apache 2.0 open source license allows this but I think that it is considered standard practice to at least mention where the code came from.  While the UI is most clearly Hippo with a simple logo swap, Hippo is mentioned nowhere in the literature.  It took some digging to find the &lt;a href="http://www.bluenog.com/BluenogDependencies/"&gt;list of open software included in the full Bluenog ICE suite&lt;/a&gt;.  The Bluenog product itself is not open source (&lt;a href="http://www.bluenog.com/clickwrapsla/"&gt;license&lt;/a&gt;).  The  only downloads available are the compiled JARs and to get that, I needed to fill out a registration form.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile &lt;a href="http://www.onehippo.com/en/home"&gt;Hippo B.V.,&lt;/a&gt; makers of Hippo CMS, continues their work on their &lt;a href="http://docs.onehippo.org/hippo-ecm/"&gt;re-write of Hippo&lt;/a&gt;.  While the wiki has not seen much change, there seems to be a steady flow of source code commits.</content>

    <title>Reference Checks</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Without a doubt the tool that software selections most neglect is the reference call.  More often than not, reference calls are treated as a mere formality &amp;mdash;  a box to check after the decision has been made just in case someone asks.  When checking references after the decision has been made, the reference checker is just going through the motions hoping against the unlikely chance that something negative turns up.  Any hints at issues or other useful information are summarily ignored.  When done this way, reference calls are probably not worth doing at all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But reference calls don't have to be this unproductive.  When done properly they can provide critical information of what it is like to partner with a software supplier and use its software &amp;mdash; after all, isn't that what a software selection is all about?  Doubters of the efficacy of reference checks point to the fact that the software supplier is in control of the process.  Vendors only connect you to customers that they have been successful with.  This can be a valid point.  But I would counter with two facts: one, it is desirable to know what types of clients and engagements a supplier has been successful with; and two, every software integration/implementation project has its challenges and it is useful to know what they were and how the supplier overcame them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To make reference calls as effective a possible, I recommend the following guidelines:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When to call?&lt;/strong&gt;  Call references as early in the process as you can.  Usually this is once you have established your short list of products and you have qualified your organization as a legitimate buyer.  Insufficient references is a great way to rule out products that are not worth considering.  The vendors that you work with may balk at connecting you with references this early.  This is understandable since these people are their customers and they don't want to annoy them by repeatedly asking them to talk to unqualified prospects.  You need to work out some kind of compromise here.  Limit your request to one really relevant customer rather than a long list from which you will call two or three.  You might be able to connect to one of these customers through your own network.  Also, if you have benefited from a reference call, "pay it forward" by offering to be a reference for products your company owns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which Customers?&lt;/strong&gt;  Be very selective as to which references you speak with.  You only want to talk to companies that are using the software to solve similar problems.  When the software salesman flashes the customer logo slide (you know the one I am talking about), don't be dazzled by the household brands that you recognize.  Really dig into what the customers are doing with the software.  If you work for a university and you see another university's logo on the slide.  Stop the conversation and ask what that university is doing with the software.  You might learn that only a tiny department uses the product.  In that case, don't put much stock in that "customer success story."  If, like your employer wishes to do, the customer has standardized all departmental websites onto the platform, put that customer on your list of references to request.  In addition to learning about their use of the product, you might also learn about some organizational challenges that would be relevant to your initiative.  It is a red flag if the vendor can't point you to any customers who have used its software to do what you want to do.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which Contacts?&lt;/strong&gt; Only talk to reference contacts who are intimately involved with the implementation and day to day usage.  Senior level managers tend to be sheltered from the detail that you want to know.  They usually only hear about usability issues if the users are picketing down the halls.  If they did hear about a usability issue, they many not know if it was related to the product or the implementation.  Ideal reference contacts are project managers who were involved with the planning, execution, and rollout of the implementation.  They know what "out of the box" features took weeks to "configure."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to ask?&lt;/strong&gt; It is important to have a list of questions to guide the conversation but don't be afraid to go off script.  Look for clues of problems and dig in to unravel hidden issues.  As a baseline, you want to know what they use the software for, when and to whom they first rolled it out, what version they are on, workflow and user segmentation, how actively they maintain the solution.  Ask open ended questions because every one of those topics can be a source of issues.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you follow these guidelines, reference calls can become a central part of your selection process rather than a useless formality.  You will get first-hand knowledge from someone who has been down the path you are considering and can avoid spending too much time looking at products that have not demonstrated an ability in your problem domain.  &lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Back to Java?</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Robert Cringely has an interesting article predicting the return of Java as a core language for the web: &lt;a href="http://www.cringely.com/2011/10/the-second-coming-of-java"&gt;The second coming of Java&lt;/a&gt;.  The flow of his argument is that Java is much faster than interpreted languages (such as Ruby, PHP, and Python) but performance hasn't mattered because the primary bottleneck has been disk I/O. Without the practical performance downside, Ruby, Python, and PHP have been attractive because of their easy learning curves. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The game changer, according to Cringely is that the disk i/o problem is getting solved with technologies like solid state drives.  To qoute:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Yeah, but there’s a problem looming for Ruby and Rails (Python, Groovy, etc.) and it is that web frameworks based on interpreted, dynamic languages only exist at all because disks are just so damned slow.  What happens to these frameworks when disks get faster or disappear entirely?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interesting argument. But I think that in order to bring back the real appeal, Java frameworks need to start practicing some of the philosophies that the newer web frameworks embrace (like convention over configuration).  Java developers need to get more pragmatic and stop building &lt;a href="http://discuss.joelonsoftware.com/default.asp?joel.3.219431"&gt;Hammer Factory Factory Factories&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Personally, I think the big thing is going to be newer JVM languages (like Scala).  That is, if Oracle doesn't get too greedy.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Hippo CMS 7&amp;#39;s New Content Type Editor</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Arjé Cahn posted a short &lt;a href="http://blogs.hippo.nl/arje/2009/08/an_improved_template_editor.html"&gt;video demonstrating the Hippo CMS 7's new content type editor&lt;/a&gt;.  The process is all GUI driven and looks very slick.  It is difficult to know whether this is as flexible as the old Hippo CMS 6 system of editing layout and xsd files but it certainly appears easier.  It is also nice to see that Hippo CMS 7 maintains the ability to control the layout of the entry form.  Most CMS products only let you control the widgets used, their order, and, in some cases, what tab they appear on.  Hippo gives the developer control over the layout of the whole form.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Feature Request: Audience-Inspired Keywords</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;In order to maintain my vendor neutrality, I refrain from advising software companies about their products.  But that doesn't stop me from having ideas and opinions so I am starting a series of features that I would like to see.  Please feel free to use them and, if you do, tell me about it!  If you don't like an idea, let me know why.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today's feature request can probably be implemented (at least primitively) as a minor customization on most content management systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Audience-Inspired Keywords&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a visitor searches for content on the site (or arrives at the site from an external search result), the presentation tier records the keywords that he used.  These keywords are then listed as options that content contributors can use to tag their content.  This would allow contributors to tag content in the language of their audience.  To keep things manageable, there should be a mechanism for filtering out typos and organizing the keywords.  There may be some system that would allow you to group synonyms so if people search equally for "bike" and "bicycle," the contributor only has to use one of those terms and the asset is returned on both "bicycle" and "bike" searches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The original seed for this idea occurred way back when &lt;a href="http://blogs.hippo.nl/arje/"&gt;Arjé Cahn&lt;/a&gt;, from &lt;a href="http://www.onehippo.com/"&gt;Hippo&lt;/a&gt;, told me of an experimental feature that used the terms a contributor used to search for related images and links as keyword suggestions for the asset he was working on.  This feature idea takes it one step further by using the language of the audience, rather than the contributor.  Another part of the inspiration comes from the "&lt;a href="http://www.steptwo.com.au/papers/cmb_bestbets"&gt;Best Bets&lt;/a&gt;" strategy where you train a search engine to recommend a certain set of assets when a specific keyword is used.  &lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Presentations from the Boston Gilbane Conference</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I am catching up from a whirlwind of activity at the &lt;a href="http://gilbaneboston.com/"&gt;Gilbane Conference in Boston&lt;/a&gt; this week.  I gave three presentations (below), organized a breakfast for open source CMS software executives, and had a great time talking with so many industry friends.  It was particularly nice to meet people like &lt;a href="http://gilbane.com/blog/mt-cp.cgi?__mode=view&amp;amp;blog_id=44&amp;amp;id=221"&gt;Scott Liewehr&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/sliewehr"&gt;@sliewehr&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href="http://brandinteractivism.com/"&gt;Scott Paley&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/spaley"&gt;@spaley&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href="http://predicate-llc.com/"&gt;Jeffrey MacIntyre&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/jeffmacintyre"&gt;@jeffmacintyre&lt;/a&gt;),  and &lt;a href="http://lars.mp"&gt;Lars Trieloff&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/trieloff"&gt;@trieloff&lt;/a&gt;) who I had known only virtually before.  I wished I could have stayed for the third day of the conference but I had to get back to work.  Everyone seemed to feel very positive about business and where content management is going so I left brimming with enthusiasm for 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;What follows is a brief run through of the presentations I gave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.slideshare.net/sggottlieb/open-source-wcm-and-standards"&gt;Open Source WCM and Standards&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div style="width:425px;text-align:left" id="__ss_2649314"&gt;&lt;a style="font:14px Helvetica,Arial,Sans-serif;display:block;margin:12px 0 3px 0;text-decoration:underline;" href="http://www.slideshare.net/sggottlieb/open-source-wcm-and-standards" title="Open Source WCM and Standards"&gt;Open Source WCM and Standards&lt;/a&gt;&lt;object style="margin:0px" width="425" height="355"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://static.slidesharecdn.com/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=cmpros-091204082034-phpapp01&amp;stripped_title=open-source-wcm-and-standards" /&gt;&lt;param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"/&gt;&lt;param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always"/&gt;&lt;embed src="http://static.slidesharecdn.com/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=cmpros-091204082034-phpapp01&amp;stripped_title=open-source-wcm-and-standards" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="355"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;div style="font-size:11px;font-family:tahoma,arial;height:26px;padding-top:2px;"&gt;View more &lt;a style="text-decoration:underline;" href="http://www.slideshare.net/"&gt;documents&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a style="text-decoration:underline;" href="http://www.slideshare.net/sggottlieb"&gt;sggottlieb&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday morning, I did a presentation called &lt;a href="http://www.slideshare.net/sggottlieb/open-source-wcm-and-standards"&gt;Open Source WCM and Standards&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href="http://cmprofessionals.org/"&gt;CMS Professionals&lt;/a&gt; Summit.  To summarize, open source really has nothing to do with open standards but there are some areas where they converge.  "Open source" describes a license.  Any software can be open source if it is assigned an &lt;a href="http://www.opensource.org/docs/osd"&gt;OSI-compliant&lt;/a&gt; license.  Open standards is about software design &amp;mdash; technology choices about what standards to support.  That said, there are three areas where open source and open standards converge:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;when an open source project is started to create a reference implementation for an emerging standard (note, on slide 5 I didn't say that Alfresco was created as a reference implementation for CMIS, you had to be there.);&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;when there is a chicken and egg problem of value and adoption (like RSS and now &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework"&gt;RDF&lt;/a&gt;) some open source projects have the install base to easily create widespread support and a lower hurdle create an implementation;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;projects driven by developers tend to put a higher priority on aspects like integration  and attention to technical detail than marketing driven products which are more feature oriented.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How to Select a WCMS&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;My "How to select a WCMS" workshop is turning into a signature presentation for me.  There was not too much difference from &lt;a href="http://www.slideshare.net/sggottlieb/selection-workshop-slides-from-gilbane-san-francisco-2009-conference"&gt;prior presentations of this workshop&lt;/a&gt; except this time I went into more detail &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2009/03/doubt.html"&gt;on using doubt to make a decision&lt;/a&gt;.  At that time, my friend &lt;a href="http://www.siteworx.com/company/leadership/tim_mclaughlin/"&gt;Tim McLaughlin, from Siteworx,&lt;/a&gt; had popped into the room.  He told me afterwards that he agrees with the approach and even read a scientific paper that found that the best decision makers use this method of elimination for choosing.  Tim, if you are reading this, you owe me that link!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One particularly interesting part of that worshop was that one of the audience doubted the necessity of content management systems in general. So I was put into the position of having to defend the industry.  He was coming from an organization that was managing 100 very small, unique, independently managed, and unimportant websites.  In this case, I had to agree and I used the &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2009/07/you-bought-a-web-page-factory-not-a-webmaster-android.html"&gt;metaphor of a factory&lt;/a&gt;.  You don't build a factory to produce less than 10 units.  A CMS would not help him until he started to try to manage all those websites in a more uniform way.  For the time being, I suggested that he look into &lt;a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/contribute/"&gt;Adobe Contribute&lt;/a&gt; which handles basic things like deployment and library services without trying to manage reusable content.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.slideshare.net/sggottlieb/open-source-whats-it-to-you"&gt;Open Source: what's it to  you?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div style="width:425px;text-align:left" id="__ss_2648532"&gt;&lt;a style="font:14px Helvetica,Arial,Sans-serif;display:block;margin:12px 0 3px 0;text-decoration:underline;" href="http://www.slideshare.net/sggottlieb/open-source-whats-it-to-you" title="Open Source Whats It To You"&gt;Open Source Whats It To You&lt;/a&gt;&lt;object style="margin:0px" width="425" height="355"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://static.slidesharecdn.com/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=opensourcewhatsittoyou-091204060416-phpapp02&amp;stripped_title=open-source-whats-it-to-you" /&gt;&lt;param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"/&gt;&lt;param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always"/&gt;&lt;embed src="http://static.slidesharecdn.com/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=opensourcewhatsittoyou-091204060416-phpapp02&amp;stripped_title=open-source-whats-it-to-you" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="355"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;div style="font-size:11px;font-family:tahoma,arial;height:26px;padding-top:2px;"&gt;View more &lt;a style="text-decoration:underline;" href="http://www.slideshare.net/"&gt;documents&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a style="text-decoration:underline;" href="http://www.slideshare.net/sggottlieb"&gt;sggottlieb&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;I presented with &lt;a href="http://www.webmergers.com/about/bio_detail.php?eid=294"&gt;Kathleen Reidy from The 451 Group&lt;/a&gt; on "The rise of Open Source WCM."  Kathleen had some great slides talking about commercial open source vendors in the market.  My presentation was from a buyer and implementer perspective.  The general message was that buyers have the benefit of more choices and more information but they also have the responsibility to take a more active approach to selection.  They can't expect an analyst firm or salesman to tell them what is the best product.  They need to understand their requirements and implement a solution that solves their business problems.  Open source software suppliers depend on customers doing more pre-sales work themselves and they pass that savings back in the form of no (or low) licensing fees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biggest disappointment was when &lt;a href="http://gadgetopia.com/"&gt;Deane Barker&lt;/a&gt; misunderstood slide 5 and &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/gadgetopia/status/6278017713"&gt;tweeted that I think that open source is like a free puppy&lt;/a&gt;. Of course, this was re-tweeted several times.  As I have said, &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2008/12/interwovens-foss-fud.html"&gt;all CMSs are like puppies: some are free, some cost lots of money, but all require care and feeding&lt;/a&gt;.  If you have the intention of owning a puppy and understand the costs involved, you appreciate that a free puppy is less expensive than a puppy that you have to buy.  If you spontaneously come home with a  a puppy just because it was free, you might be in for an unpleasant surprise.  Similarly, if you adopt a CMS just because it is free and you have not budgeted for properly implementing a website, you will get into yourself into trouble.  Later, Deane and I had a great dinner together with &lt;a href="http://hobbsontech.com/"&gt;David Hobbs&lt;/a&gt; before I headed back home.  &lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>JCR: More than just Java</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;If you have been intrigued by the &lt;a href="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=170"&gt;The JCR&lt;/a&gt; but feel left out because you are not a Java shop, you might be interested to know that other technologies are getting in the game as well.  Henri Bergius, of the &lt;a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/"&gt;Midgard CMS&lt;/a&gt; has started working on &lt;a href="http://www.bergie.iki.fi/blog/jukka_back_from_hiatus__jcr_for_midgard.html"&gt;making Midgard accessible to a JCR via JNI&lt;/a&gt; (the Java Native Interface which allows you to execute native, non-java, code from a Java application).  There has also been talk about a &lt;a href="http://thinkforge.org/projects/php170/"&gt;PHP-170 project&lt;/a&gt; to implement a JSR 170 compliant repository in PHP although no code has been submitted.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More recently, Stefane Fermigier has written about an attempt to &lt;a href="http://blogs.nuxeo.com/sections/blogs/fermigier/2005_06_25_jsr_170_java_content"&gt;hook Zope into a JCR&lt;/a&gt; by using &lt;a href="http://jpype.sourceforge.net/"&gt;JPype&lt;/a&gt;, a Java-Python bridge.  In this blog entry, Stefane makes a good case that the structure of the JCR is very similar to the ZODB because both are node based rather than relational (as in a relational database).   Having JCR storage option this would address a common issue with Zope which is that the ZODB is closed and difficult to manage in extreme conditions.  My current client has a ZODB which is over 45 GB (That is just text.  Images are stored outside.) and is growing at a rate of 2 GB per month (packed).  We are working on a prototype to store content in a relational database to get around that limitation.  In the elevator, I ran into a former co-worker who works for another company upstairs and they are doing the exact same thing.  The ZODB is enticingly easy to build applications on and, in most cases, more than sufficient.  However, in extreme cases, alternatives, especially standards compliant ones, are nice to have.  &lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Engagement is not a Plugin</title>
    <content type='html'>I recently attended &lt;a href="http://cmsexpo.net/"&gt;CMS Expo&lt;/a&gt; and there was a lot of discussion about "engagement" — presentation-side functionality to create more enriching experiences for customers (on the website and beyond). Engagement is a pretty hot topic within the CMS industry these days. By focusing on engagement, companies can get more value from their content and serve their customers better. The upper tier of WCM vendors have fully committed to this trend. &lt;a href="http://www.sitecore.net/"&gt;Sitecore&lt;/a&gt; now describes its offering as a "Customer Engagement Platform." &lt;a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/cq.html"&gt;Adobe calls CQ the "foundation of the Adobe Web Experience Management (WEM) solution"&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="http://ektron.com/Products/Web-CMS/Digital-Experience-Hub/"&gt;Ektron has its "Digital Experience Hub"&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="http://www.opentext.com/2/global/products/products-opentext-ecm-suite/products-ecm-suite-engagement.htm"&gt;OpenText puts its WCM products under the "Engagement" section of their portfolio&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="http://promote.autonomy.com/promote/solutions/customer_experience/index.page?"&gt;Autonomy has theirs under "Customer Experience Management."&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When hearing about the opportunities and benefits of engagement, you could see the audience (mostly open source CMS developers) thinking about how they would build these features into their platforms. What struck me though is that thinking about engagement as a technology problem, to be solved with code, is doomed to failure. Yes, we can program some logic that displays different content under different conditions and automates some actions. But as long as we think of engagement as "features" that the developers leave behind, the result will be a fortress of software that insulates an organization from its customers and inhibits real engagement. The software will be correct to the specification but fail to achieve its goal of enhancing visitor experience. In fact, it is more likely to assume wrong and frustrate visitors than get lucky and do the right thing. We all know how hard Amazon and Netflix work with their algorithms &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?sugexp=chrome,mod=6&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;q=netflix+thinks+i+am+gay"&gt;and they still get it wrong&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Engagement is a two-way conversation. To create an engaging experience, a company needs to deeply understand its audience. A company needs to listen for the slightest hints of delight or disappointment and continually adjust to get more of the former and less of the latter. Like with anything, you can only automate engagement once you get really good at doing it manually. You can only offer good suggestions if you have been observing what people pick on their own and know how happy they were with their choices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you start to build in business logic to engage visitors, you better have metrics and in place, constantly monitor them, and have the skills and the time to tune your algorithms. Engagement functionality is not going to work for companies with a set it and forget it attitude. But for companies that are already executing a content strategy (so they have the right content) and actively seeking performance feedback (through analytics and anecdotal information), engagement features will present opportunities to serve their customers even better.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The same is true for the editorial side of content management technologies. If a company is not good at developing and organizing effective content, if it doesn't have the right skills and processes, a CMS is not going to help much. But in the hands of an organization with a good content strategy and strong executional capabilities, a CMS is an invaluable asset. You can't execute a content strategy without one. Some CMS vendors get this and have developed training programs to help build the organizational capabilities necessary to execute a successful content program (both on the editorial side and on the engagement side). The ones that don't risk losing customers &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2011/03/what-is-a-content-management-assessment.html"&gt;who fail to meet their goals and wind up blaming the product&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Engagement is something that all companies should strive for. An unfulfilled visit is a huge missed opportunity. It could be a lost sale. It could lead to an expensive call to a call center. Worst of all, it creates frustration with your brand that, through social media, spreads like kudzu. Companies won't succeed with engagement because they bought software with the word "engagement" on the tin. They will succeed by having the organizational capacity to learn and serve their customers and by working with tools that support their optimized business processes.</content>

    <title>Demonstrating CMS Value</title>
    <content type='html'>I have a reputation in the content management industry for being an open source advocate.  Commercial CMS vendors that do not know me well sometimes balk when they hear that I am involved in a product selection. They are afraid that I am going  to steer my client toward an open source solution.  It is true that I know a lot about the open source options. I have written &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/products-page"&gt;reports on open source content management systems&lt;/a&gt; and directed a content management practice at a consulting company specializing in open source software.  However, people that know me well know that I don't favor software based on licensing model.  I focus on the appropriateness and quality of the technology as well as the viability and compatibility of the supplier.  I have worked for systems integration partners of CMS vendors and I even did a tour of duty in the professional services organization of CMS Vendor.  In fact, 8 of my last 10 product selections resulted in commercial CMS purchases — and I think that these clients all made good choices based on their particular requirements and infrastructure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Perhaps a greater fear from some vendors is that my client is going to be price sensitive.  I think this is a valid point but not because there may be an open source solution on the short list.  The short lists that I provide my clients typically contain products from different price points.  I can do this because I take the time to learn about the products and what they are good at.  I see roughly 50 product demos a year and I regularly talk to people who implement the technology.  CMS selection consultants that build short-lists from third party analyst research tend to pick from a single pricing tier based on the client's budget.  When this happens, value is factored out of the decision-making equation and I think that is a problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When competing against lower price products, the onus is on the vendor to justify the additional cost of its solution by demonstrating additional value.  I think that is a fair request and the better upper tier vendors succeed in answering that request.  To prove  value, a vendor needs to have great software that efficiently solves hard problems.  &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2009/06/is-this-cms-worth-the-money.html"&gt;The best product for the a particular set of requirements is not always the most expensive one&lt;/a&gt;.  When it is, the vendor of that product needs to invest time to understand and translate features into the valuable solution.  It is not enough to point to an analyst chart to justify a price position.  A vendor needs to &lt;em&gt;show&lt;/em&gt; why the product is a better choice than potentially less expensive alternatives.</content>

    <title>Magnolia Community Edition 3.5 (RC1) Available</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;This morning there was an announcement on the &lt;a href="http://www.magnolia.info"&gt;Magnolia&lt;/a&gt; user mailing list that the first release candidate (RC1) of version 3.5 is now available for &lt;a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=86297&amp;amp;package_id=89560"&gt;download&lt;/a&gt;. If you were waiting for version 3.1, don't worry, you didn't miss it. It is the same release. Still, this is a pretty big release. Some of the more notable features is better internationalization support. It used to be that localized sites needed to be managed more or less independently with no real relationships between different translations of the same asset. The new version provides better support for 1:1 localization schemes. Future releases and add-on modules will provide more functionality in this area. The new version has also been re-factored to be easier to customize. For example, many of the configurations have been transformed into beans that can be overridden and extended. There is also better support for filters. Security has also been enhanced with URL level access control (in addition to content level access control).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Enterprise Edition will be released after the Community Edition is final and stabilized. If you are using Magnolia Community Edition, you might want to download it and give it a try - especially if you have built modules. The Magnolia team has tried to support backward compatibility for 3.0 modules but you never know. Now would be a good time to tell them if there is a problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content>

    <title>Can Outages be Good for the Cloud?</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I was just thinking about &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2012/07/cloud-blues.html"&gt;the recent AWS outage&lt;/a&gt; and came to the conclusion that infrequent events like this probably help Amazon.  While the first wave of response is usually criticism and doubt, the end result is probably increased adoption.  Here is why.  I don't think that events like these are chasing anyone away from the cloud.  The reality is that technology occasionally breaks &amp;mdash; especially under extreme conditions.  No matter where you have a data center, bad events are going to happen.  I was just talking to a friend who works in the Baltimore area and their self-hosted site has been down for days due to power outages.  When people take a close look, they realize that most cannot provide better availability than cloud computing resources.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than abandon the cloud, I expect that most customers will do what I found myself doing: the opposite &amp;mdash; increase their cloud investment.  If they were in one availability zone, they will expand their cluster to get into multiple availability zones and even multiple regions (which I am doing).  They will create warm standby servers to switch over to in the event of a catastrophic failure.  All these changes increases their monthly AWS bill and leads to higher Amazon revenues.  It's just like the insurance business.  The best time to sell new policies is right after an unlikely disaster, which is also usually the least likely time for the disaster to happen again (especially when new controls are put in place to prevent it).&lt;/p&gt;</content>

I am really looking forward to visiting Gent and meeting the content management community there.  Hopefully I will see you.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>&amp;quot;Tell me about your setup&amp;quot;</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Finding excellent technical people is a constant challenge that I struggle with every day. The traditional recruiting process of searching résumés for keywords has been broken for a long time.  You need to use clever techniques like my "&lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2012/08/an-unconventional-approach-to-recruiting.html"&gt;One Field Job Application&lt;/a&gt;" and engage in various communities to find people who are passionate about their craft and want to do great work.    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interviewing candidates is even harder than sourcing them. You don't want to waste anyone's time (including your own) but you also want to get a real feel of how someone works.  Developers who work on large teams are particularly hard to evaluate because responsibilities are often ambiguous.  It takes a while to learn that a candidate had a really mundane role on that very interesting project on the résumé or that he/she didn't have the professional curiosity to learn about what other people were doing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some recent experiences are leading me to believe that the ideal technical interview question is "Tell me about your setup." While the tools that people use may at first seem mundane and subjective, I am starting to believe that tools are a reflection of the attitude a person brings to his/her work. This theory was originally inspired by the site &lt;a href="http://usesthis.com/"&gt;UsesThis&lt;/a&gt;, which contains personal descriptions of the tools that people use.  The people that submit their setups are clearly passionate about their work and pay attention to the details.  Most importantly, they identify with their work &amp;mdash; and that is critical to the type of commitment that leads to greatness.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am not so interested in &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; the tools are (although I am starting to see some interesting patterns that I might share in a later post).  I am more interested in the &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt;.  If an interview candidate starts to light up when explaining why she loves to use something, you know right then that she loves her work and she loves being good at her work.  This is especially true for people who like tools that require some dialing in but have incredible power. Users of these tools have proactively invested their time to get better at something.  Contrast that with someone who is indifferent about his tools: who just uses what he is offered; who likes a tool because it has buttons that you can click that does things that he doesn't understand. To me, that is a sign that I am talking to a drone that is satisfied with the bare minimum. His passion lies elsewhere or doesn't exist at all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Passionate professionals who care about their craft don't just make a team more effective, they also make work more fun because passion is contagious. When you see a colleague doing cool things, you want to learn from them. You are also inspired to raise the level of your own work. When your peers are just going through the motions, it has the opposite effect. You de-personalize and get cynical and start identifying with Dilbert.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Plone 4 Features Announced</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I was catching up on my blog reading and noticed that the &lt;a href="http://plone.org"&gt;Plone&lt;/a&gt; community has &lt;a href="http://plone.org/news/plone4-plips-accepted"&gt;announced what features will be in Plone 4&lt;/a&gt;.  Version 4 will incorporate 40 "PLIPs" ("Plone Improvement Proposal:" the Plone project's issue/enhancement tracking system).  You can see the &lt;a href="http://dev.plone.org/plone/milestone/4.0"&gt;list of enhancements and bug fixes here&lt;/a&gt;.  The release is expected to be completed in the end of 2009.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While, to me, 4.0 seems like a less ambitious release than 3.0, a few features caught my eye:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tiny MCE replaces Kupu as the default WYSIWYG editor&lt;/strong&gt;.  From a user perspective, this is probably the most noticeable change.  While a number of number rich text editors are supported through add-on modules ("Products"), Plone has been a bit of an outlier for using Kupu as the default, and best integrated editor.  Plone has favored Kupu because of its simplicity and the well formed HTML that it produces.  However, users tend to like all the buttons and additional formatting features offered by TinyMCE and FCK.  TinyMCE is widely used as the standard editor in many open source and commercial CMSs.  Plone will be in good company.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cleaner handling of object references.&lt;/strong&gt;  Plone's repository (an object database) is hierarchical like the Java Content Repository.  In most cases, business users like the similarity with the familiar filesystem model.  However, like file systems, there is a disadvantage when you want the same item to appear in more than one place in the content tree.  Like most hierarchical repository systems, Plone has developed a referencing system (like a symbolic link or a shortcut).  Version 4.0 of Plone will make references cleaner and easier for non-technical users to use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delegated group management.&lt;/strong&gt;  Plone has a good system for managing groups and roles.  However, to this point, only a site manager can control group membership.  With this release, there can be group owners who manage membership for the groups that they own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;jQuery will be bundled.&lt;/strong&gt;  jQuery, the popular AJAX framework is becoming nearly ubiquitous.  Now Plone will ship with it bundled into the basic install.  From this, I expect to see lots of little UI optimizations in the upcoming releases.  Of course this will be balanced with Plone's emphasis on accessibility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improvements to the self registration system.&lt;/strong&gt;  Plone can be configured to allow users to register to the site and be put into a pending status or become full blown members.  4.0 will have some enhancements to fine tune these configurations with more sophisticated behavior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better control over portlet visibility.&lt;/strong&gt;  Plone 4.0 will make is easier to configure rules that control when a portlet displays on  page.  For WordPress users, I think this is a little like &lt;a href="http://freakytrigger.co.uk/wordpress-setup/"&gt;Widget Logic&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;a href="htt://drupal.org"&gt;Drupal&lt;/a&gt; users will recognize this as part of the blocks framework.  Hopefully, Plone will not ask the user to implement the display logic in code.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New default theme&lt;/strong&gt;  Plone 4 is going to ship with a new default theme based on the newly redesigned plone.org site.  This will affect intranet implementations (which tend to do less custom theming work) than external website implementations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those are the big changes from what I can tell but I am sure that I am leaving things out.  Please add any major oversights in the comments.  &lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Being a 10X programmer</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/#!/jacktemplin"&gt;Jack Templin&lt;/a&gt; just sent me this excellent article called &lt;a href="http://blog-johnfn.herokuapp.com/entry/4"&gt;How to be the 10X programmer&lt;/a&gt;.  A 10X programmer is a single person who has the effectiveness of 10 programmers.  While this at first sounds like an impossible or at least unsustainable model of one super hero doing more work than a team, it is reasonable when you think of one person having the effect of increasing the productivity of everyone around him.  That is, the productivity increase is not limited to his/her own output.  Here is the kernel of the argument. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The 10X programmer is hypersensitive to problems. Solving a problem that costs other programmers a minute of waiting will gain a lot more than a minute for any programmer who then encounters that problem later. This is because of flow).&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Importantly, the 10X programmer fixes the problems that knock her out of flow. Fixing problems - even "trivial ones - , leaving documentation so people can understand faster, keeping a database of common problems, and so forth, all potentially make a much larger difference because of flow than just a few minutes it takes to fix them. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;I feel like I have worked around people like this and have had fleeting episodes when I have added that value.  The true challenge is that the 10X programmer quickly becomes a bottleneck because he/she is the pivot point through which many decisions get made.  The temptation to fill up his/her time with meetings is too great.  Also, there is the question of compensation.  Can the employer really afford to pay these programmers what they are truly worth?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is probably more realistic is to establish a culture where everyone on the team thinks like this.  I love the Pragmatic Programmer books because they help inspire you to do great work that makes you and your peers more productive.  Maybe you don't get a full team of 10X programmers but a team of 5X programmers is nothing to complain about.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Who is replacing WordPress?</title>
    <content type='html'>I have been working on an interesting data set about web content management system (WCMS) installs. From these data I am able to identify events when an organization rebuilds their website on a new WCMS. As anyone who has been involved with a web development project knows, a website re-platforming represents a lot of time, expense, and decision making. So these events are important market signals -- especially when you consider the platform they are leaving and how long ago it was deployed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I am starting to publish interesting observations on the Aberdeen Blog. &lt;a href="https://ww.aberdeen.com/techpro-essentials/what-replaces-wordpress/"&gt;This first post lists which WCMSs most commonly replace WordPress&lt;/a&gt;. I am doing similar analysis on other software categories such as eCommerce.&lt;br /&gt;

    <title>Karim Lakhani on The Mozilla Corporation</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://web.mit.edu/lakhani/www/"&gt;Karim Lakhani&lt;/a&gt; wrote an interesting &lt;a href="http://spoudaiospaizen.net/archives/2005/08/organizational-innovationthe-mozilla-corporation/"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; about the &lt;a href="http://www.mozilla.org/reorganization/"&gt;Mozilla Corporation&lt;/a&gt;, a wholly owned, "taxable," subsidiary of the &lt;a href="http://www.mozilla.org"&gt;Mozilla Foundation&lt;/a&gt;.  Karim is serving on the advisory committee to help Mozilla how to figure it all out.  The article describes how Mozilla Corporation has an opportunity to become a new kind of software company focused on "social responsibility, profitability and community purpose."  Of course, corporate buyers will focus on the price and quality of the product, but the social/community angle will help foster good will and contribution from the development community.  Who knows? Maybe the Mozilla Corporation will become the &lt;a href="http://www.benjerry.com/"&gt;Ben and Jerry's&lt;/a&gt; of software.</content>

    <title>First PodCast</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I know I am late into the game but I am still trying to figure out the utility of podcasts.  For me, the medium does not really work.  I guess that is because&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol type="A"&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't have an iPod&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I take &lt;a href="http://www.mbta.com/"&gt;the T&lt;/a&gt; to work and like to read during my commute&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My life has lots of interruptions.  So when I read, I just get in really small bits at a time - except when I am riding the T&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those of you who can make better use of this medium than I can, Rahel Anne Bailie from &lt;a href="http://www.intentionaldesign.ca"&gt;Intentional Design&lt;/a&gt; recorded &lt;a href="http://www.intentionaldesign.ca/index.php/weblog/blogcentre/seth_gottlieb_demystifies_authoring_in_a_content_management_environment/"&gt;this semi-lucid commentary&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="http://lighthouseseminars.com/gilbane_sf_06/sf_06.html"&gt;Spring Gilbane Conference&lt;/a&gt; in San Francisco.</content>

    <title>Sean Kelly&amp;#39;s Better Web Application Development Screencast</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Sean Kelly, from &lt;a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/"&gt;NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory&lt;/a&gt; (no, not &lt;a href="http://www.seankelly.com/"&gt;Sean Kelly of cycling fame&lt;/a&gt;), has a &lt;a href="http://oodt.jpl.nasa.gov/better-web-app.mov"&gt;funny screencast&lt;/a&gt; comparing web application frameworks.  While there is a clear bias toward Python and Zope (the JPL used Plone for the Mars Rover Site), it is good entertainment mixed in with some very valid points.  So, if you like Python, or if you like Java and have thick skin, it is worth a look.  It reminds me of my days back in college trying (fruitlessly) to make the case for IBM PC DOS over my roommate's Mac 512. Hearing myself say "C Colon Backslash Data Backslash ...  Backslash  ... Backslash," I knew that every "Backslash" was a another hole in my argument.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly,  Java is not as efficient as many of the newer frameworks.  Moving most of the code into XML configuration files has not really solved the problem, just moved it.  Sean calls all the XML work that you need to do with Java nowadays "XML Situps."  I am not a total Java basher.  But I do think that Sean raises an excellent point: if you want fast turn around in your development cycle (code, review, fix), which is what is good for web application development, an interpreted scripting language gives you an edge over a compiled language.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Noticeably absent from this comparison is anything from the PHP world.  Sean just reviews J2EE, Ruby on Rails, Zope (Plone), Django, and TurboGears.  We have a couple of project teams using the &lt;a href="http://www.symfony-project.com/"&gt;Symfony framework&lt;/a&gt; and they love it.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>How to Post on an Open Source Mailing List</title>
    <content type='html'>I was going through some slide presentations on my computer and I stumbled upon a deck that my friend &lt;a href="http://www.oslutions.com/"&gt;Renaud Richardet&lt;/a&gt;  presented &lt;a href="http://contenthere.blogspot.com/2007/01/open-source-myths.html"&gt;on my panel at the 2006 Boston Gilbane Conference&lt;/a&gt;.  Renaud talked about how to join a community and gave some tips on getting help from a mailing list.  Looking at some lists that I subscribe to, it looks like this advice needs to get out more.  If you find no one is answering your questions, it might not be the community.  It might be you.  Sometimes someone will (perhaps brusquely) rebuke you for poor forum manners.  Other times you might be ignored or (worse) silently blacklisted.  To prevent this from happening, I suggest you practice the following habits:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lots of projects have guidelines for using the mailing list.  Read them and follow them.  They often include some good advice like you see here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do your homework before posting on the list.  Search the archives.  Read the documentation. Only ask after you have tapped existing resources and came up blank -  not because you are too busy to try.  Everyone else is busy too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Indicate the work that you have done in your post by saying things like "I followed these instructions (with link) and this is what I am seeing" and "I tried the following approaches."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Give as much background information as possible including what you are trying to do, the version of the  components you are working with, your platform, code snippets, and excerpts from your log files (BTW, be sure to edit down your log files to remove confidential information such as passwords etc.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Even if your problem is urgent, don't treat the community like they are your paid help.  Avoid demanding language in ALL CAPS, etc.  No tantrums allowed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you are really stuck, many projects have IRC channels that may give you more a immediate response.  It is a good idea to hang out in these channels to get to know the community and learn.  Sometimes the conversation may lean toward the social/fun side.  Feel free to participate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If your request does not get a response, reply to your message with more information that shows you are still working on the problem and are trying different things.  This will also bubble your message to the top so that more people can see it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Remember to thank anyone who responds - even if they have the wrong answer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Frequently there are independent consultants participate in the lists.  Consider hiring one if you are really stuck.  Think of it as spending a fraction of the money you are saving by not buying an annual support subscription.  If you find yourself frequently needing hands-on help, consider building a formal relationship with a support provider.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you figure out the problem on your own, reply to your message with the answer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you see people with similar problems, engage them to work together to figure them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Consider publishing the information that you could have used in the documentation wiki of the project.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;If you follow these guidelines, you do more than just help yourself.  Well worded questions and good follow up make the mailing list archive a richer resource for others to search.  If you are already an expert in the community, try to be as patient with the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N00b"&gt;n00bs&lt;/a&gt; as possible and gently coach them on list etiquette. Community karma swings both ways.</content>

    <title>Never use cost savings to justify spending more on a CMS</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Replatforming your website to a new web content management system is an expensive proposition.  In fact, a CMS migration can be so expensive and risky, that &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2011/03/what-is-a-content-management-assessment.html"&gt;I  advised many of my CMS selection clients against doing it&lt;/a&gt;.   That is not to say that there are not perfectly legitimate reasons to replace a CMS.  The wrong CMS can hold you back and prevent you from seizing valuable opportunities.  But one sure fire way to spot a foolish CMS replacement project is when it is justified by a return on investment (ROI) calculation that relies on future labor cost savings to offset the price of an expensive CMS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The truth is, if you make a big CMS investment, you will probably spend more time managing your content and optimizing the experience for your visitors.  Why? Because advanced (expensive) web content management systems allow you to  do more sophisticated things like personalization, multivariate testing, and advanced analytics.  If your CMS has these features, you better actively manage them because &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2012/05/engagement-is-not-a-plugin.html"&gt;neglecting advanced engagement functionality is worse than not having it in the first place&lt;/a&gt;.  Buying an expensive CMS to avoid the human effort of managing a website is about as silly as buying an expensive car because you want to spend less time driving.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you must show an ROI projection to justify the cost of a new web content management system, focus on the top line.  &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2007/11/cms-business-case.html"&gt;Talk about the value (or potential value) of your content&lt;/a&gt;.  Talk about the opportunity to reach new markets or connect with potential customers in new ways.  And make sure to set aside plenty of budget for people to operate and get the most out of that CMS.  To learn about all that goes into effective an marketing operations program, see me present at the &lt;a href="http://nowwhatconference.com/"&gt;Now What Conference&lt;/a&gt; next month.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to treat your website like a project where you "do the website" and then forget it about it for a few years, I would seriously consider ripping out your CMS entirely and &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2012/01/fun-with-static-publishing.html"&gt;build a nice static brochure website&lt;/a&gt; that you can cheaply host.  If you just need to make occasional updates, there are lots of cheap and free web content management products available.  Many of these products can take you pretty far as you increase the intensity of your digital marketing program. But if you want to go high end, your initiative will fail unless you build a competent marketing operations program that gets the most out of the technology.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>The RFP is Dead! Long Live the RFP!</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;There has been an interesting thread on the &lt;a href="http://www.cmpros.org" title="CM Professionals"&gt;CM Professionals&lt;/a&gt; mailing list discussing the efficacy of an RFP. Many participants cited frustration with an RFP process that wastes people's time with unnecessary formality and the pretension of an even contest. I think everyone who has been in business has witnessed the act of an RFP being distributed after the contract has been awarded. The RFP process, as it is commonly practiced, suffers from four major flaws:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Buyers make their choices harder by forcing suppliers to submit identical proposals. I hate the expression "comparing apples to apples." What if you would prefer an orange? You &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;want&lt;/span&gt; the vendor to show their individuality.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vendors are suspicious of the RFP process and try to limit their exposure by expending energy qualifying the deal and their chances rather than investing in their proposal. You don't get anything but canned demos and copy-paste responses until you have reached a short list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Companies with good products are too busy to respond to blind, widely distributed RFPs. The issuer of these RFPs tend to be flooded by responses from marginal companies with struggling products.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The RFP process is, by nature, adversarial and not a good way to start a partnership. Imagine finding a spouse with an RFP.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, you need some kind of process to keep you from falling in love with the first pretty user interface you see. There are some good aspects of an RFP that are worth keeping. You need some kind of document that communicates your requirements and your selection process. It is important that all the candidates have the same baseline information to tailor their sales process. &lt;a href="http://contenthere.blogspot.com/2007/05/while-back-i-wrote-post-on-selecting.html"&gt;My process for selecting a CMS&lt;/a&gt; uses an RFP in this way. I don't send an RFP to more than three vendors that I think are a good match for the requirements. I am sure to communicate this fact to the candidates. Vendors that have worked with me before know that if I contact them, they should jump right to the short list stage of their sales process when victory is in sight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the RFP contains the baseline, vendors should be invited to ask questions to help them produce more compelling and tailored proposals. Their ability to ask the right questions (and actually listen to the answers) is a differentiator. I want them to understand as much as they can about my client so they can put together a great proposal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The required written response to an RFP should be lean. Less time invested in the written response means that the vendor can put more work into preparing a customized demo that will resonate with the audience. The goal is not for the client to lock themselves in a room and read proposals. You want to engage with the vendor. If you have been selective about who is participating, you can spend the time with each vendor that you are evaluating and get to know each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the RFP itself is not dead, the old RFP process has certainly outlived its use. The RFP should not be a restrictive conduit for communication. It should be a starting point for a dialog. The RFP should not be an open call for the market to stand forward and identify itself. The issuer of an RFP should already understand the market and be selective as to who it invites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Software selection should be an active process, not a passive one. It takes investment and education from both sides to meet in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content>

    <title>Users want easy. Developers want simple.</title>
    <content type='html'>One of my favorite tech presentations is &lt;a href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy/"&gt;Rich Hickey’s Simple Made Easy&lt;/a&gt;. The premise of the talk is that simple and easy are not the same thing. In fact, you often sacrifice simplicity in pursuit of easiness. As Rich says, we consider something easy if it is “at hand.” Like the &lt;a href="https://www.staples.com/Staples-Easy-Button/product_606396"&gt;Staples Easy Button&lt;/a&gt;. Simplicity is something totally different. It is the absence of complexity - lots of moving parts entwined together in intricate ways. If an “easy button” really existed, it would be supported by a complex network of solutions that could take care of any problem. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Rich was talking about programming and how to keep code maintainable. Simple code is easier to understand and extend. But I apply this perspective to lots of things. For example, a bicycle is a simple machine. A quick glance reveals how it works and what every part does. But pedaling up a hill is not easy. A modern car is complex. There is a lot of stuff going on under the hood and nearly all drivers accept that they have no hope of understanding it all.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In building software, I have come to realize that users only value ease. A user wants the features he/she likes “at hand.” In a mature, multi-featured application, UI design is mainly focused on hiding some features to make the frequently used ones stand out. Users don’t want simple. Take away any feature and there will be complaints. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Developers want simple. They want to work with code that is understandable and behaves predictably. They realize that every new feature is supported by hundreds of lines of code that need to be tested with every modification. Much of Rich's talk deals with programming styles that unnecessarily create complexity. But some requirements will force even well designed code to become complex. Ironically, these requirements are often driven by a desire for a "simple and easy" user experience (personalization, natural language inputs, voice control...).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Why does this matter? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If we don't acknowledge that "simple and easy" are in conflict, there will be unmet expectations that lead to friction between stakeholders. Users can become impatient discussing complex details about their "simple feature." Development teams can feel under-appreciated for the effort required to do a "simple thing." The time taken to wrestle with ignored complexity can look like incompetence.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Take, for example, the Google search box. It is easy to use... just type in some text and click the button. But it is anything but simple. There is an &lt;a href="https://www.lifehack.org/articles/technology/20-tips-use-google-search-efficiently.html"&gt;art to constructing effective queries&lt;/a&gt; and a whole industry (SEO) dedicated to manipulating what comes back. There is also a set of &lt;a href="https://zapier.com/blog/advanced-google-search-tricks/"&gt;features that makes the search box like the command line for the web&lt;/a&gt;. I can't tell you how many times I have heard "I just want something simple like Google." Google isn't simple. But it &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; easy. What makes Google search feel easy is that the core functionality is obvious and it gives useful feedback to help you get what you want. You may not get what you want on the first try, but it is easy to refine your search to hone in on your target. Voice assistants aim for the same level of ease but I find the trial/error loop to be more frustrating. That is probably because the system can return only one response and the feedback loop takes longer. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I know how annoying it can be for someone to pick at language and I am not advocating to constantly correct people on their word choices. But I do think it is important for everyone to understand what they are asking for and what they are giving up when they get it. We can do that by probing into what the user means by "simple." That question is reasonable because both "simple" and "easy" are subjective terms that require elaboration. When we document requirements, we should avoid all subjective language. After all, most of the work to achieve the perception of ease and simplicity is through iteration and refinement. These qualities are not intrinsic to the feature but rather to the sentiment of the user. </content>

    <title>Code moves forward. Content moves backward.</title>
    <content type='html'>One of the primary functions of a web content management system is separating content from layout.  Authors create semi-structured content in a display-neutral format and then the presentation templates transform that content to web pages for regular browsers, mobile browsers, RSS feeds, email, and print.  As most readers of this blog know, this separation introduces big efficiencies in re-use: content is managed in one place and appears in many places and in many formats.  But this magic does not come for free.  Someone has to build presentation templates that render the content and that person needs to have developer skills.  The template developer needs to know HTML and the special templating syntax to retrieve and format content from the repository.  The developer also needs know how to test software for all the different conditions that it will encounter: different browsers; content with extreme values in any of its elements (like a really long title or a missing summary); and even high traffic load.  Because one piece of code can potentially affect every page on the site, testing is important and it needs to be done in a safe place.  The same thing goes for all sorts of other software configurations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Essentially, the role of the static webmaster has been broken into two: the content contributors (that no longer need to be technical) and the developer (who needs to be more skilled than your average DreamWeaver jockey).  It also breaks up the management of the site into two lifecycles: the content lifecycle and the code/configuration lifecycle.  The production instance of the CMS itself is designed to support the content lifecycle.  CMS have workflow functionality to manage the state of an asset from draft through published and to archived.  They have preview functionality so that only contributors can see content that has not been published.  Some CMS are designed sot that the development lifecycle can also occur in the production instance.  This is usually done by creating workspaces or sandboxes — essentially treating code like another category of content.  To be sure, you still want to have a QA instance of the system so you can test software upgrades (of the core) before applying them to your live site.  In most CMS, however, developers work on separate environments (either individual developer environments and a code staging area or a shared development environment) and not the live, productive instance of the CMS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the content and the software lifecycles are de-coupled, they are interdependent.  Developers need realistic content to develop and test code.  The content relies on the code to define and display itself.  There are lots of situations where these aspects get tangled.  For example, when a new field is added to a content type it needs to be populated (sometimes manually) and the presentation templates need to be modified to display it.  There are also cases where the line between content and code starts to blur: contributors style their content with CSS classes that are defined in style sheets; contributors can embed a tag that calls some additional display logic (like inserting a re-usable display component); contributors can build web forms that need to be submitted to code that does something with the information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src="http://media.contenthere.net.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/blgimages/code-content.png" alt="" /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The standard approach for managing these interdependencies is what I call "code forward, content backward." Code and configuration is developed in a development environment and tested in a QA environment.  When it is ready, it is deployed to production.  Content is developed and previewed in the production instance that contains the staging (or preview) and live content states.  Periodically, content should be published backwards to the development and QA instances so that testing can be realistic as possible.  In cases where the code/configuration and content are so tightly coupled (like when you need to break one field into two), you may need to export production content to the QA instance where you do some content transformation and test it with the newest code and then push that content and code back to production at the same time.  When you do this, just make sure that you don't have anyone adding content to production because it will be overwritten or (worse) cause some kind of corruption.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Different CMS handle the migration of code and content in different ways.  Some provide nice graphical utilities to export configurations from instance of the application to another.  In other products, there are ways to manually transfer the settings as a collection of files.  Some products don't support this at all so you have to manually repeat the same steps on each environment you are managing.  When you are evaluating CMS products, keep these requirements in mind.  Otherwise, you will be in for a surprise as you near the launch date of your new website and you need to fix bugs on live content.</content>

    <title>Jarn releases special sauce for hosting</title>
    <content type='html'>If you run a &lt;a href="http://plone.org"&gt;Plone&lt;/a&gt; site, you may find yourself envious of PHP WCM systems that are so easy to host on cheap, basic hosting plans.  While many of the PHP based WCM products are designed to run on a shared hosting plan, most hosting providers don't even know what &lt;a href="http://zope.org"&gt;Zope&lt;/a&gt; is and don't want it on their servers.  You may have been burned by the Zettai implosion and have been afraid to trust another Plone specialist.  Maintaining a single instance of Zope on a leased server is not hard.  You just need to know about packing the database and other administrative functions.  The only hurdle is the need for basic server administration skills (monitoring, security, backups, etc.) that many small companies tend not to have...  at least not to the level that you need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things may be about to change.  &lt;a href="http://www.jarn.com"&gt;Jarn&lt;/a&gt; (formerly Plone Solutions.  &lt;a href="http://www.zeapartners.org/articles/jarn008"&gt;They changed their name&lt;/a&gt; as part of the transfer of the Plone name to the Plone Foundation.) has &lt;a href="http://www.jarn.com/blog/diy-plone-hosting"&gt;published their framework for Plone hosting&lt;/a&gt;.  From a technical perspective, this may be an even more generous move than changing there name.  If hosting providers pick this up and use the technology as a way to expand their offering, Plone may see an adoption trend similar to what &lt;a href="http://www.mamboserver.com/"&gt;Mambo&lt;/a&gt; saw when it became installable through &lt;a href="http://www.swsoft.com/plesk/"&gt;Plesk&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Mambo-like growth spurt is probably too ambitious.  Zope tends to need more resources (memory, in particular) than your average PHP based system that can run on a stingy VM or shared host.   But still, there may be a noticeable increase in options.  On the &lt;a href="http://plone.org/documentation/faq/where-can-i-host-my-plone-site"&gt;Plone hosting page&lt;/a&gt;, there are 6 providers (including Jarn).  It will be interesting to see if this list expands as a result of Jarn's move.</content>

    <title>Hey Look! I am on the TV!</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Last week I had the privilege of joining &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/#!/sliewehr"&gt;Scott Liewehr&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="http://www.cms-connected.com/"&gt;CMS Connected&lt;/a&gt;, a web television show about content management.  The topic was "&lt;a href="http://www.cms-connected.com/Previous-Shows/Web-CMS-Year-in-Review-2011.aspx"&gt;2011 WCM Year in Review&lt;/a&gt;" and we covered a lot of ground: mobile, engagement, and the cloud.  &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/#!/twentworth12"&gt;Tom Wentworth&lt;/a&gt;, from &lt;a href="http://www.ektron.com/"&gt;Ektron&lt;/a&gt; dropped in on Skype for a cameo appearance too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had a great time and folks on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/#!/search/cmsconnected"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; seemed to enjoy the conversation as well.  You can watch it &lt;a href="http://www.cms-connected.com/Previous-Shows/Web-CMS-Year-in-Review-2011.aspx"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  I also got to meet &lt;a href="http://butchstearns.tumblr.com/"&gt;Butch Stearns&lt;/a&gt; who I know from listening to &lt;a href="http://www.weei.com/"&gt;WEEI&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Big thanks to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/#!/typyburn"&gt;Tyler Pyburn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.thepulsenetwork.com/"&gt;The Pulse Network&lt;/a&gt; for hosting and &lt;a href="http://www.falcon-software.com/"&gt;Falcon-Software&lt;/a&gt; for their generous sponsorship.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>How Open Source CMS Fits into the Future of Digital Publishing</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;In his &lt;a href="http://www.shore.com/commentary/newsanal/items/2006/20060206siiaiia.html"&gt;summary of the SIIA Information Industry Summit&lt;/a&gt;, John Blossom makes some interesting observations about the future of the publishing industry.  His ideas were largely based by the presence of Craigslist CEO, Jim Buckmaster, and his measured customer focused approach to the content industry that appears to be so successful.  Some of the points that John makes that I think are directly relevant to open source.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;"Online publishing is swinging the base of the content industry back to small to medium businesses."&lt;/b&gt;  I think that content is distribution is shifting focus from creating a content destination to a syndication model where you have many publishers that are aggregated in different ways.  Using an open source CMS, many of which have syndication support built in, it is inexpensive to establish enough infrastructure to become a node on the content network.  Success is determined by the quality of the content rather than the scale of the source.  The extreme of this is a simple blog.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;"Getting technology right is important, but it's not as important as building trust with your users. "&lt;/b&gt; To support this point the John talks about Craigslist with its primitive layout and simplicity.  To quote further: "Identifying a core need and filling it in a way that people really like and trust takes just a smidgen of carefully developed technology in many instances."  Identifying that core need often requires experimentation and agility that precludes making big bets on technology.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the key values of open source is that it is inexpensive to try an idea by putting just enough technology in place test for business value.  If the idea is successful, the solution can be scaled and evolved to support additional requirements as they surface.  Putting in commercial technologies that are targeted for feature focused "enterprise software selection" diverts attention from the original business idea to the elaborateness of the tools.  I think this is a lesson that Web 2.0 has learned from the Internet bubble.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Corporate Use of Blogs and Wikis</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Lauren Wood, of &lt;a href="http://www.gilbane.com"&gt;The Gilbane Report&lt;/a&gt; has an excellent introductory &lt;a href="http://www.gilbane.com/gilbane_report.pl/104/Blogs__Wikis_Technologies_for_Enterprise_Applications.html"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; on the corporate use of Blogs and Wikis (factoid: did you know that "Wiki" is a Hawaiian word for "hurry" or "quick"?).  The article gives real world examples of companies using blogs and Wiki's for internal and external communication purposes.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I agree with Lauren that these tools have great potential in the enterprise.  Blogs and Wiki's support information sharing needs that get miss-handled by email.  My metaphor for email is a big heavy crescent wrench that gets used for everything from whacking something like a hammer to tightening and loosening the smallest of nuts -in the process,  destroying both the wrench and the things you are trying to fix with it.  Email is (miss)used as a file system, database, audit trail, and discussion tool.  As a result, almost every one I know complains about how unmanageable their email box is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wiki's and blogs are a happy medium between totally unstructured email and extremely structured and formal content management solutions.  Like email, these tools give users a low hurdle (technical, organizational, and process) to contribute valuable information.  However, unlike email, information within these systems is less vulnerable to being lost and is more accessible to a wider audience - especially when coupled with a good search engine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The article also discusses the risks of using Wiki's and links to a very good &lt;a href="http://www.ldodds.com/blog/archives/000184.html"&gt;blog posting&lt;/a&gt; by Leigh Dodds about how to make your corporate Wiki succeed.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>I appreciate the effort but....</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;A recent post to the &lt;a href="http://www.cmprofessionals.org"&gt;CM Professionals&lt;/a&gt; mailing list recommended a tool by EverAge consulting to write use cases in XML.  I was interested because I think use cases are very effective in collecting software requirements and I think the de facto format (MS Word) is a really bad way to store this information.  I had to check it out.  Just not right then because I had 80 other emails to go through that morning.  So I wanted to bookmark it for later reference.  And that is where the trouble began...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The link was directly to the Zip file containing the software.  I didn't want to bookmark that because the Zip file itself would give me no context (metadata).  So visited the website to look for a landing page.  Oh, the flashturbation!  The site looks like a lava lamp of navigation items and text oozing around as they form on the page.  While I appreciate all the work that went into this animation, from the user's perspective, it has the same effect as a slow loading page.  Every click, I had to wait several seconds as the page mutated into something usable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I finally found the content that I was looking for, it was in a flash movie so I couldn't book mark it there either.  So here is the link: &lt;a href="http://www.everage.ca"&gt;http://www.everage.ca&lt;/a&gt;.  To get to the tool: wait and admire, click on resources, wait and admire, it's the first entry in the little scroll box in the middle of the page.  Or go directly &lt;a href="http://www.everage.ca/Use_Case_Creation_Tool.zip"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While all the Flash does a good job of showcasing EverAge's skills in interactive page design and programming, I think it risks sending the message that EverAge doesn't understand the appropriate use of Flash and its limitations.  Web designers are going to go through a new learning curve as they start to use AJAX and other technologies that push the limits of what is a page.  The tension between innovation and usability/familiarity will need to re-stabilize as designers and developers try new things and users react.  Search and bookmarking are primary considerations.  So much of existing internet technology is based on URLs and anchor tags.  Take those away and the user's familiar tools quickly lose their potency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think of the browser as two things: a traditional browser, and an operating system on which to build dynamic applications.  Make your decision early as to what you need it to be and design your interfaces accordingly.  My general rule of thumb is to avoid using AJAX or Flash except when you want a user to interact with (rather than just view) the content and do not try to re-invent the browsing experience.  Otherwise you will gain little benefit but spend lots of time solving problems that have already been solved with existing best practices (search engine optimization, accessibility compliance, etc.).  If you want to improve your content viewing experience, focus your energy on making better content.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Creepy Personalization</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;The New York Times has an interesting article about eCommerce personalization - &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/24/technology/e-tailer-customization-whats-convenient-and-whats-just-plain-creepy.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all"&gt;&lt;em&gt;E-Tailer Customization: Convenient or Creepy?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  The big take-away here is that if you want to experiment personalization, you need to be prepared to adjust because the results may be the opposite of what you want.  &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2011/09/context-and-the-future-of-web-content-management.html"&gt;Before you implement sophisticated display logic, you need to build the capacity to manage it.&lt;/a&gt;  Otherwise your visitors will probably be worse off than if you did nothing.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Why the Redesign?</title>
    <content type='html'>Astute observers of this blog have probably noticed that I redesigned the site. Being someone who agrees with &lt;a href="http://www.slideshare.net/lrosenfeld/redesign-must-die"&gt;Lou Rosenfeld when he says Redesign Must Die&lt;/a&gt;, this wasn't as capricious a decision as it may seem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So why the redesign? Two reasons really. First, since joining &lt;a href="http://www.globalmarketingops.com/"&gt;Lionbridge&lt;/a&gt; this site is no longer for selling consulting services. It has gone back to its roots as a blog. I wanted to move away from the Content Here, Inc. company branding and get it back to a personal blog. Second, and more importantly, I wanted to experiment with adaptive design. Over the past year, a growing proportion of my traffic has been from non-desktop devices (phones and tablets). Reading the site was rough on a little screen. And that plays into a larger philosophy of minimalism — keeping as little as possible between the reader and the content.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As an experiment, I downloaded a very basic theme (&lt;a href="http://colorlabsproject.com/themes/backbone/"&gt;Backbone&lt;/a&gt;) and didn't customize the code at all. I just played with the configuration options. I also benchmarked the site using &lt;a href="http://sitebeam.net/tour/tests"&gt;Sitebeam, which applies 40 tests&lt;/a&gt;. After a bit of tweaking, I was able to increase my total score from 5.6 to 6.9 out of 10. The greatest improvements were in accessibility (from 6.0 to 7.3) and technology (4.6 to 6.0). There were also improvements in the content and marketing categories (see screenshot).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sggottlieb/7536119088/" title="Content Here Sitebeam Score by sggottlieb, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8148/7536119088_85c472c1d2.jpg" width="500" height="343" alt="Content Here Sitebeam Score"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It remains to be seen if these scores reflect real usability and utility improvements. Anecdotally, I think the mobile version is much better. The content stands out and is easy to read. That was the result that I was going for. More importantly, I want to hear from you. Please provide feedback in the comments, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sggottlieb"&gt;Twitter (@sggottlieb)&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/102992494947018640072/posts/Z53b75xnj3s"&gt;Google Plus&lt;/a&gt;.</content>

    <title>Plone Foundation welcomes sponsorships from consultancies</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://plone.org/foundation"&gt;The Plone Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, the non-profit that owns the Plone copyright and manages the &lt;a href="http://plone.org"&gt;Plone project&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://plone.org/foundation/newsitems/plone-foundation-launches-sponsorship-program-for-plone-consulting-firms"&gt;has initiated a program where Plone consultancies can sponsor the Plone project&lt;/a&gt;.   In return for a $500 sponsorship fee, a sponsor will get its company logo placed on the &lt;a href="http://plone.net"&gt;Plone.net&lt;/a&gt; site (Plone.net is targeted at business people evaluating and using Plone) and the ability to place a Plone sponsor badge on its site.  Premium sponsors will be placed on the top of the plone.net search results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I think this is a good move for the Plone Foundation.  It accomplishes the goals of helping Plone consultancies become more visible and it provides funding for all the great work that the Plone Foundation does.  The $500 sponsorship fee is modest enough for individual practitioners to handle - especially considering all the benefit they get from being part of the Plone community.</content>

    <title>Publish is not just a button</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sggottlieb/7209200080/" title="QuickPress by sggottlieb, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8028/7209200080_93f8c6f64a.jpg" width="500" height="256" alt="QuickPress"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.shirky.com/weblog/"&gt;Clay Shirky&lt;/a&gt; is one my favorite writers on digital publishing.  Whenever I run across one of his articles, I read it twice and I usually wind up agreeing with him even if I object at first.  But one of the points that I have not come around on is when he says:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Publishing is not evolving. Publishing is going away. Because the word “publishing” means a cadre of professionals who are taking on the incredible difficulty and complexity and expense of making something public. That’s not a job anymore. That’s a button. There’s a button that says “publish,” and when you press it, it’s done.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;a href="http://blog.findings.com/post/20527246081/how-we-will-read-clay-shirky"&gt;link to interview&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is definitely some truth here. The publisher's role of gatekeeper to availability has been reduced as the technical barriers to getting content from producers to consumers have eroded.  I don't need a printing press or a distribution network to make my content available. I can post a message that the world can see by sending an SMS from a cheap cell phone.  But that doesn't mean that anyone is going to absorb the message.  It will probably be lost in the stream. My content is only going to be received if it is good, the right people are paying attention, and it hits them at a time and in a format that is useful to consume and share.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back in the days when publishing was technically hard, we tended to fixate on the mechanical part of publishing. The capital required to acquire printing and distribution capabilities served as a barrier to entry, but it wasn't the only one. Another barrier was having an attentive audience. This meant painstakingly building trust by offering reliable, useful, and/or entertaining information. The elimination of the technical barrier reduced the up front expenditure to get into the publishing game, but you still need to do the legwork to stay in it. We tend to discount the effort that "internet celebrities" invest in building a brand. Many of these people are driven by passion so it may not feel like a job, but it is a lot of work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I agree that publishing as a big, monopolistic business is dying. You can no longer get fat and happy as a middleman because the playing field is so dynamic and everyone has a chance to displace you if they do a better job. But even as we see big media companies in crisis, publishing is emerging as a discipline within all organizations. I am sure you have heard the phrase "all companies are publishers now." Corporate publishing has transformed from adapting paper sales collateral to the browser to executing a multi-faceted, multi-channel content strategy to inform and engage audiences on and off the website (email newsletters, mobile apps, Twitter, Facebook, Google, Stumbled Upon, LinkedIn...).  Companies employ content managers, graphic designers, social media experts, SEO experts, and analytics specialists to understand, serve, and appeal to an audience as publisher traditionally would do. Collectively, this field is called "Marketing Operations" and it represents a lot of work &amp;mdash; especially if you are operating in several languages and in many markets.  &lt;a href="http://www.globalmarketingops.com/"&gt;This is what I do at Lionbridge.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pushing the "publish" button but may seem easy but it is just a small step in a much larger process to build and reach audiences.  Prior to the publish button, there is planning around placement, timing, and what kind of formats to target.  Perhaps adding a graphic or interactive application would help get the point across.  These decisions should be based on the analysis of other content initiatives.  There is work to get the content into the CMS (it often originates somewhere else), tag it for SEO and targeting, and instrument it for analytics. There may be a nee to test the content on different devices. There may also be the need to localize the content for different markets.  After clicking publish there is work to gain visibility through social networks and email newsletters.  Good bloggers know what I'm talking about and have been doing this for a long time.  Large corporations are just learning about it. Then there is multivariate testing and analytics, tuning for search engines, and possibly purchasing ad words.  Lastly is taking all that you have learned and applying it to the next iteration through the publishing cycle.  Do this continually and consistently and your customers will love you and your prospects will notice you.  Do it badly and your competitors will periodically check in on your website just to make sure that you are still in business. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, Clay, publishing isn't just a button.  It may be losing its importance as an industry but it is becoming increasingly important as a discipline within marketing organizations for all industries.  That "cadre of professionals" still exists, it has just refocused from getting something public to getting something noticed. And it took a new job in the marketing department under the title "marketing operations."&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Content Management Assessment Worksheet</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I uploaded this content management assessment worksheet up on Scribd a few weeks ago and buried a reference in another blog post.  To make it easier to find, I am reposting it here.  I would love for people to put their scores in the comments but I assume that most people would be too embarrassed to share.  If you find this fun and interesting, you should take the the &lt;a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/B8Y3HJ2"&gt;CMS Implementation Survey&lt;/a&gt; to anonymously share your experiences with others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a title="View CMS Implementation Worksheet on Scribd" href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/54963380/CMS-Implementation-Worksheet" style="margin: 12px auto 6px auto; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,Sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; -x-system-font: none; display: block; text-decoration: underline;"&gt;CMS Implementation Worksheet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;iframe class="scribd_iframe_embed" src="http://www.scribd.com/embeds/54963380/content?start_page=1&amp;view_mode=slideshow&amp;access_key=key-2hmkoujdmb0jpo16m0bj" data-auto-height="true" data-aspect-ratio="1.2938689217759" scrolling="no" id="doc_86727" width="100%" height="600" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;(function() { var scribd = document.createElement("script"); scribd.type = "text/javascript"; scribd.async = true; scribd.src = "http://www.scribd.com/javascripts/embed_code/inject.js"; var s = document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0]; s.parentNode.insertBefore(scribd, s); })();&lt;/script&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Microfeeds</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;[Correction: as you can see in the comments, John Eckman pointed out that pulseofoss is the work of   &lt;a href="http://www.rinzai.com/"&gt;Raven Zachary&lt;/a&gt; (451 Group) and &lt;a href="http://www.witigonen.com/"&gt;Michael Richardson&lt;/a&gt; - not Optaros.]&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have been getting into &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; lately. At first I thought it was a waste of time but now I really like how less than 140 characters and a brief moment of attention can make you feel "up to date" with someone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;To give you an idea of how short 140 characters is, Twitter would have cut me off the previous paragraph after the word "feel." For some, 140 characters is enough to speak volumes. My former Optaros colleague &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/jeckman"&gt;John Eckman&lt;/a&gt; has totally mastered the medium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also like how companies are starting to use Twitter as a low key publishing tool. &lt;a href="http://www.cmswire.com/"&gt;CMSWire&lt;/a&gt; also has a &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/cmswire"&gt;good feed&lt;/a&gt; pointing out news flashes and links to good articles. &lt;a href="http://www.optaros.com/"&gt;Optaros&lt;/a&gt; just launched a feed called &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/pulseofoss"&gt;pulseofoss.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now I have yet another reason to buy a smart phone.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Microsoft to help Apache POI</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://ostatic.com/158700-blog/microsoft-to-help-sourcesense-open-office"&gt;Via Ostatic: Microsoft to Help Sourcesense&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; and open source integrator &lt;a href="http://www.sourcesense.com/en/home"&gt;Sourcesense&lt;/a&gt; recently &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2008/mar08/03-25SourcesensePR.mspx"&gt;announced a partnership&lt;/a&gt;.  One of the areas that they will be collaborating is on the &lt;a href="http://poi.apache.org/"&gt;Apache POI&lt;/a&gt; project.  For those who are not familiar with POI, it is used by several CMS (and other applications) to transform Microsoft Office file formats into indexable text and other neutral formats like PDF.  POI has not kept up with the latest Office 2007 formats so this is good news for CMS like &lt;a href="http://www.jahia.org"&gt;Jahia&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.openoffice.org/"&gt;OpenOffice&lt;/a&gt; is also used as a server side library for MS Office file transformation.  Interestingly, POI doesn't support OpenOffice and the OpenDocument format very well.  Hmmm... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content>

    <title>Social Media Traffic Patterns</title>
    <content type='html'>Louis Gray has written a post about a trend that has been on my mind a lot recently: &lt;a href="http://www.louisgray.com/live/2008/06/has-friendfeeds-comment-activity.html"&gt;traffic and other activity shifting from the information source to social and aggregation sites&lt;/a&gt;.  Louis has some compelling data showing that people are increasingly using sites like &lt;a href="http://www.friendfeed.com"&gt;FriendFeed&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.twitter.com"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; to comment on provocative articles and blog posts.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The overall trend started with blogs and social bookmarking sites but is really accelerating with &lt;a href="http://friendfeed.com/"&gt;FriendFeed&lt;/a&gt; and tools like &lt;a href="http://www.twhirl.org/"&gt;Twhirl&lt;/a&gt; that bring content right to your desktop and make it amazingly easy to comment.  &lt;div class="thumbnail"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skitch.com/sggottlieb/c2yy/sggottlieb-twhirl-0.8.1"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.skitch.com/20080602-fw18eu6qmu44wfs3fquhqx3sji.preview.jpg" alt="sggottlieb - twhirl 0.8.1" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Lucida Grande, Trebuchet, sans-serif, Helvetica, Arial; font-size: 10px; color: #808080"&gt;Uploaded with &lt;a href="http://plasq.com/"&gt;plasq&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="http://skitch.com"&gt;Skitch&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There have been a number interesting discussions about who owns your comments and how to control the conversation.  &lt;a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/who_owns_all_these_comments.php"&gt;Many of the ideas are summarized on this blog post on Read Write Web&lt;/a&gt; and the related comments.  Not surprisingly, there are even more comments about this post on FriendFeed.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are interesting implications for publishers.  Publishers that depend on advertising revenues are justifiably concerned that traffic is being pulled away from their site.  To be sure, some traffic is lost especially when the conversation about the topic goes astray and eclipses the topic itself.  But there is also a gain in traffic as people click through to the article to create their own informed opinion on the topic (although less people do this than you would expect.  Often they just comment on the other comments).  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If a publisher is more interested in mindshare than eyeballs and advertising revenue, this trend is a great opportunity because it gives higher visibly to the idea or business. In particular, companies that publish content for marketing purposes benefit.  As Web 2.0 marketing strategies take hold, more and more companies are trying viral communication to get their message out.  Of course, because no one controls it, the attitude can easily turn to the negative.  Some companies are hurt more from negative commenting than others.  Companies that create physical products (and shipped software) are hurt the most because they can't easily address people's complaints.  SaaS companies can use the feedback to make their products better and then jump into the conversation and tell everyone that they were listening and made the correction.  Many businesses can take the P.T. Barnum's attitude ("I don't care what the newspapers say about me as long as they spell my name right.") because any publicity is good publicity.  Publishers that hope to prevent the expression of negative opinion by disabling the commenting feature have no hope at controlling the conversation.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the good news is that conversations are happening digitally and out in the open (rather than verbally around a water cooler in some office park or through point to point emails) so it can be tracked, tracking and monitoring a conversation that is happening all over the web is a challenge.  Conversations on Twitter are fleeting but the impression left in the reader's mind is much longer lived.  You can't bookmark a tweet (even if you could, you may not be able to follow the link because Twitter is often down).  You can bookmark and link a FriendFeed post (and its related comments) but Google doesn't index these detail pages very well (it only indexes the listing pages that rapidly change).  It seems like the best thing you can do is subscribe to searches for each of the services and more seem to be popping up every minute.  Another good strategy is to pay close attention to web server logs (using an analytics package) and look for traffic spikes and referrers.  The spikes are likely to be more subtle than a &lt;a href="http://digg.com/"&gt;Digg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/"&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="http://stumbledupon.com/"&gt;Stumbled upon&lt;/a&gt; reference but the significance from a marketing perspective may be more profound depending what is said about you.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a fascinating topic.  Please discuss (where ever you want to).</content>

    <title>Woah! Intertonomy!</title>
    <content type='html'>While I was heads down working yesterday &lt;a href="http://www.cmswire.com/cms/enterprise-cms/the-search-is-over-autonomy-acquires-interwoven-003810.php"&gt;Autonomy announced that it will be acquiring Intwerwoven&lt;/a&gt;.  I must say that for the past year or so Interwoven has been behaving like a company that wants to get acquired (little investment in the product, super-aggressive sales to existing and new customers) but I didn't expect Autonomy to be the buyer.  I guess I expected one of the middleware or hardware vendors to step in - one of those "up the stack" plays.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From a philosophical point of view, having a search vendor own a CMS feels a bit strange - a little like the tail wagging the dog.  It used to be that the search vendors were the acquisition targets.  How does an independent search vendor continue to partner (and integrate) with CMS vendors after they become a competitor?  I wonder what this means to Autonomy's OEM business.  For a while Verity (since acquired by Autonomy) depended heavily on OEM deals.  I would expect that the OEM market for search components is in decline with the widespread use &lt;a href="http://lucene.apache.org/"&gt;Apache Lucene&lt;/a&gt;.  But I am sure that there are other partnerships and business opportunities that this acquisition would risk.  This probably creates opportunities for the middle tier search companies to step into partnerships that Autonomy has walked out of.</content>

    <title>Open Sourcing Windows?</title>
    <content type='html'>A reader sent me along this &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ryanrogers/archive/2006/07/08/660423.aspx"&gt;really interesting post&lt;/a&gt; on a Microsoft employee blog floating the idea of open sourcing Windows.  The comments are insightful with a little bit of zealotism thrown in here and there ("No real Free-Software developers would dare even look at it, in case they got tainted").  The general consensus (if there is one) seems to be that open sourcing older versions Windows would be useful to people still running those operating systems and getting little help from Microsoft or other software vendors who are not excited about supporting outdated versions.</content>

    <title>Fixed bid implementation work: a marriage made in Vegas</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Most of my CMS selection clients are not just looking for software.  They are looking for a solution that includes software and also a hefty dose of services to configure, customize, train, and support.  Typically, once we have narrowed down to a short list of products, we start looking at systems integrators that can help develop the solution.  A well-executed implementation and roll-out of a marginal product usually yields better business results than a train-wreck project to implement best-fit software.  You need to work with a services organization (internal or external) that can partner with you to define and develop the solution that achieves your goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other day, I was talking with a friend about projects gone bad and he asked me if I ever worked on a big fixed bid project that both client and supplier felt went very well.  After considering all the projects that I worked on and the projects that I hear about as an analyst, I had to say no.  There was always disappointment and frustration on either or both sides (usually both).  But I was able to think of many iterative time and materials relationships that benefited both sides over years of working together.  I have now been out of the systems integration business long enough to say, without any personal agenda, that fixed bid systems integration work is a failed enterprise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best analogy that I can make is that a fixed bid contract is like marrying someone you met at a craps table on a Las Vegas vacation.  I am not saying that all spontaneous Vegas marriages fail, but they definitely have the odds stacked against them.  Here is why;  during the sales process, both sides get wrapped up in the deal and suppress rational doubts and concerns.  They force themselves to believe everything is going to work out.  They force decisions and assumptions that turn into a millstone hanging around the neck of the relationship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The supplier talks himself into believing that he fully understands all the requirements and that every detail about his approach to solving them is accurate.  That is simply impossible.  No matter how long the pre-sales cycle lasts, it is impossible to fully understand every requirement and bring to light every latent expectation.  The client doesn't know what he wants until he sees what he doesn't want.  The initial estimate may have even been trimmed down because it "looked too big."  The client also assumes he fully understands the requirements and believes he is reasonably flexible about the design details.  He trusts that the fixed bid contract ensures the delivery of the solution in his minds eye for the agreed upon price in the stated time frame.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the deal is consummated, there is a short honeymoon phase where everyone seems to work together productively.  This analysis phase goes smoothly because the stressful deadlines are far away and there are no concrete tests for progress.  Sometimes a project can go through design without any awareness that it is horribly off course.  That realization usually happens during the first development milestones when it is clear that the developer and client had significantly different understandings of the specification (if there even is one).  Then things start to degrade very quickly.  Both sides are stressed out and start to blame each other.  Both parties feel like the other is being unreasonable.  The contract that was supposed to protect everyone is turning into a handcuff connected to the most annoying person in the world.  Both sides start looking for a way out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any successful partnership depends on both parties working collaboratively and creatively to solve problems as they come up.  A fixed bid contract prevents this cooperation by making the relationship inflexible.  But, you may ask, how much flexibility is realistic when a client has a limited budget and has promised a certain outcome of the project to company leadership and/or the customers?  With a fixed bid contract, there is at least clear chain of blame.  The business blames the project sponsor.  The project sponsor blames the project manager.  The project manager blames the consulting company.  The consulting company blames the employees.  The employees feel miserable and quality suffers.  The contract provides unambiguous blaming instructions but it doesn't solve the problem.  The project is delayed and other costs will be realized.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A better strategy would be to &lt;em&gt;partner&lt;/em&gt; with the supplier to jointly design and develop the optimal solution within those budget, time, and quality constraints.  Achieving this kind of solution is an iterative/incremental process.  The final solution will gradually materialize as options are explored and learning occurs (see &lt;a href="http://www.artima.com/intv/tracer.html"&gt;Tracer Bullets&lt;/a&gt;).  But this kind of cooperation requires a huge amount of trust and, sadly, very few business relationships enjoy much trust at all.  Especially given the perceived track record of failed technology projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, how do you achieve this level of trust?  It takes time.  Just like it helps to date before you get married, you want to start off with some small, low risk projects.  Both sides need to believe that if they work at it, the relationship will last a long time and benefit them.   There also needs to be transparency and equal rewards.  The systems integrator needs to be transparent about their capabilities and experience and they cannot expect a huge windfall over a single project.  The systems integrator should consume project resources (budget) as if they were his own.  The client should expect to pay for what he gets and not try to trick the supplier into committing to unreasonable results.  As &lt;a href="http://www.grahamoakes.co.uk/"&gt;Graham Oakes&lt;/a&gt; says, if you do not try to the make the relationship a win-win, you will probably wind up being the one who loses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you are buying services, you are really buying effort &amp;mdash; not a result.  A good project team will multiply the effort you purchased with skill and experience to deliver great things (maybe even better than you originally thought you wanted).  The problem is, buyers are ill-equipped to gauge skill and experience.  They feel more comfortable with the illusion that they are buying tangible results.  Services companies that prefer to sell results rather than effort do so by charging a high risk premium (or "value pricing") and having employees that can step up and overwork when the risk gamble is lost.  So, the buyer is either overpaying or has hired an overworked team.  Neither of theses options sounds particularly appealing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you do find yourself forced into asking for a fixed bid contract, do not assume that you can just set your calendar to the planned launch date and wait for the results.  Instead, manage the project as actively as possible.  Set up lots of intermediate milestones with exit criteria to test that the project is on track.  If possible break up the project into multiple small fixed bid phases.  For example, have a fixed bid design phase that ends with a prototype or semi-functional core of the application.  Make sure that the design considers implementation budget as one of its requirements or constraints.  Business owners: don't let your staff get away with throwing the systems integrator under the bus when a project fails.  Make them equally accountable for the outcome of the project.  If the system integrator is underperforming you should learn of it one quarter of the way into the project; not within weeks of the planned launch date.  Even better, don't force your staff to come back with a fixed bid contract.  Encourage the assembly of a high performing team of staff and consultants that maximizes the value of your budget.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Nice wrap up of the Gilbane Conference</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.globelogger.com/item.php?id=646"&gt;Charlie Wood has a nice summary&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="http://lighthouseseminars.com/gilbane_sf_06/sf_06.html"&gt;Spring 2006 Gilbane Conference&lt;/a&gt; in San Francisco.  I was at the conference too and I am sorry that I didn't get to meet Charlie because I really like his blog.  One thing that Charlie described that I definitely felt this year was the sea change away from ECM as a monolithic solution and toward a model of inter-connected task specific content applications.  &lt;a href="http://www.optaros.com/pdf/itj0505_gottlieb.pdf"&gt;I couldn't agree more&lt;/a&gt;.  This is my fourth Gilbane conference and the trend has been remarkable.  Back in November 2004, I &lt;a href="http://contenthere.blogspot.com/2004/12/keynote-themes-from-gilbane.html"&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt; how the analysts were decidedly split on whether anyone was delivering on the one size fits all ECM vision.  Then in Fall 2005, there were fewer people willing to stand by the monolithic ECM vision.  This year, I heard several people say that people had over-bought content management solutions and were having difficulty adopting them due to complexity and poor usability.  This year, there was much more emphasis on lighter weight, targeted, viral technologies such as blogs and wikis that are actually doing what the big software vendors have been failing to do: enable communication and collaboration with as little impedance as possible.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Big Man</title>
    <content type='html'>Sun's &lt;a href="http://www.sys-con.com/story/?storyid=47906"&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt; that they are opening up 1,600 patents, coupled with I.B.M. announcing that they are opening up 500, reminds me of an anthropology class in college where we learned about the "Big Man" social organization structure.  In the Big Man system (practiced in some isolated islands in the SouthWestern Pacific), leaders vie for popularity and influence by outdoing each other throwing feasts and giving gifts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Big Man - almost always a male - is an elaborate version of a village leader, but unlike a village leader, he often has supporters in several villages and is a somewhat more effective regulator of regional political organization. Big Men combine a small amount of interest in their group's welfare with a great deal of self-interested entrepreneurialship for personal gain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cabrillo.edu/~crsmith/sociopolit_org.html"&gt;reference&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is this what Sun and IBM are doing?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content>

    <title>Back up is not archiving</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Alan Pelz-Sharpe has a great post on the CMS Watch Trend Watch blog that &lt;a href="http://www.cmswatch.com/Trends/1084-Backup-is-not-Archiving?source=RSS"&gt;describes the difference between back up and archiving&lt;/a&gt; (they are not the same). He makes the point more articulately than I ever could so I will encourage you to &lt;a href="http://www.cmswatch.com/Trends/1084-Backup-is-not-Archiving?source=RSS"&gt;click through.&lt;/a&gt; Alan goes on to say:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica"&gt;2008 will see ECM vendors aggressively trying to move into the archiving sector. It's a move driven (as all meaningful market dynamics are) by buyer demand. At the moment, demand stems less from a full understanding of retention and archiving, and more from the need to shift ballooning volumes of e-mails (e-mails that may well become the focus of a laywer at some future date), that are swamping mail servers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;If ECM vendors respond to the stated need of handling larger volumes of data, I doubt that their solutions will address the core need of organizing and filtering information into a useful archive. Are &lt;a href="http://contenthere.blogspot.com/2007/11/cms-business-case.html"&gt;we talking about bigger refrigerator doors&lt;/a&gt;? In the case of email, will their solutions be smart enough not to "archive" marketing, personal, and other email with no legal value?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content>

    <title>Open Source Content Management Summit Video Posted</title>
    <content type='html'>I had it in my calendar to check back to see if anyone uploaded video footage from the &lt;a href="http://2007.oscms-summit.org/"&gt;2007 Open Source Content Management Summit&lt;/a&gt; and I was happy to see that six sessions are &lt;a href="http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=label%3A%22oscms2007%22"&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; on Google Video.  Definitely watch Dries' keynote on the state of Drupal.  One of the ideas he explores is that the features that Drupal has pioneered have become commoditized and there is a convergence of functionality that has grown from sharing of ideas.  Even companies like &lt;a href="http://www.ibm.com/"&gt;IBM&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; are starting to catch up :).  As products become functionally similar, the meaningful differentiation will be ease of use and adoption that the product affords. Dries put out as a challenge to the Drupal community to make it easier for people to get involved by improving the website and incorporating some of the energy and innovation that is happening on the periphery (through module development) into the core.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He also talked about how Drupal eliminated the need for a traditional webmaster who coded HTML all day.  CCK and Views make traditionally technical tasks achievable by non-technical users.  Next in Drupal's sights is to make non-designers able to design websites.  I don't know about the last one, I think that the web is still recovering from bad design empowered by Microsoft FrontPage.  And with that, I leave you with this chilling thought...

    <title>Selection workshop slides</title>
    <content type='html'>Yesterday I presented &lt;a href="http://gilbaneboston.com/pre-conference_workshops.html#workshop-a"&gt;a 4 hour workshop on selecting a CMS&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="http://gibaneboston.com"&gt;Gilbane Conference&lt;/a&gt;.  I was pleased with the attendance and the audience's level of engagement.  People were asking questions and making comments right to the end.  Here are the slides.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="width:425px;text-align:left" id="__ss_813702"&gt;&lt;a style="font:14px Helvetica,Arial,Sans-serif;display:block;margin:12px 0 3px 0;text-decoration:underline;" href="http://www.slideshare.net/sggottlieb/gilbane-selection-workshop-presentation?type=powerpoint" title="Gilbane Selection Workshop"&gt;Gilbane Selection Workshop&lt;/a&gt;&lt;object style="margin:0px" width="425" height="355"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://static.slideshare.net/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=gilbaneselectionworkshop-1228319660369282-9&amp;stripped_title=gilbane-selection-workshop-presentation" /&gt;&lt;param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"/&gt;&lt;param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always"/&gt;&lt;embed src="http://static.slideshare.net/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=gilbaneselectionworkshop-1228319660369282-9&amp;stripped_title=gilbane-selection-workshop-presentation" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="355"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;div style="font-size:11px;font-family:tahoma,arial;height:26px;padding-top:2px;"&gt;View SlideShare &lt;a style="text-decoration:underline;" href="http://www.slideshare.net/sggottlieb/gilbane-selection-workshop-presentation?type=powerpoint" title="View Gilbane Selection Workshop on SlideShare"&gt;presentation&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a style="text-decoration:underline;" href="http://www.slideshare.net/upload?type=powerpoint"&gt;Upload&lt;/a&gt; your own.

    <title>Writing Titles for SEO</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;div style="float: right; margin-left: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sggottlieb/4266084240/" title="photo sharing"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2700/4266084240_6afbb7bc6c_m.jpg" alt="" style="border: solid 2px #000000;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 0.9em; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sggottlieb/4266084240/"&gt;SEO Unfriendly Pithy Titles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Originally uploaded by &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/people/sggottlieb/"&gt;sggottlieb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Normally I don't worry too much about search engine optimization when I write blog posts.  My writing is as much for organizing my own thoughts as it is to drive site traffic.  My philosophy on search engine optimization is to produce good content and avoid hindering search engines indexing my site. Good content is clear, well organized, and useful.  Not hindering search indexes means being text-rich, minimizing broken links, returning the appropriate status codes, and keeping HTML simple.  I am not going to trick anyone to come to &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net"&gt;www.contenthere.net&lt;/a&gt; but if I have something that would useful to someone, I want it to be found.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After reading the title of a recent blog post (&lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2010/01/the-biggest-thing-since-wood-pulp.html"&gt;"The biggest thing since wood pulp"&lt;/a&gt;), I realized that I was breaking my own very lax rules.  My attempt at a pithy title was effectively hiding what the article was about: a possible consequence of the Internet's disruption of the newspaper business.  I looked at my recent posts (see screenshot) and realized that I do this quite a lot.  One of my worst offenses is &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2009/03/doubt.html"&gt;"Doubt," which offers an alternative to to matrix-based decision-making.&lt;/a&gt;  Most people probably assume that I am talking about the movie of the same title.  Another example is &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2009/09/another-flower-war.html"&gt;"Another Flower War", which is about a dispute between Magnolia the CMS and Magnolia the social bookmarking site.&lt;/a&gt; I know this title was misleading because I was getting comment spam for garden supply retailers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pithy titles may be effective in print media when the reader has already made the investment to browse through the publication and is looking for things that spark his interest.  They may be marginally effective by causing a curious RSS subscriber to click through.  But they are totally counter productive in a search result.  Even if the search engine thinks that your article might be relevant to the query, the searcher is likely to assume that your article was listed in error as he scans the results.  You have just done the searcher a disservice because you have hidden the answer to his problem.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To some extent, some open source projects share in this problem.  Sometimes open source project names are taken from an obscure (nerdy) cultural reference or something to do with the history of the project. Sometimes project names are just intended to be fun.  I remember an &lt;a href="http://www.optaros.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;Optaros&lt;/a&gt; colleague telling me how silly he felt when he was talking to a CIO and suggested that they use &lt;a href="http://www.backhand.org/wackamole/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Wackamole for network monitoring.&lt;/a&gt;  A lot of insiders have to try and recommend a project with a silly name for it to get credibility in the mainstream.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overly clever titles are an inside joke that excludes potential new readers.  It's a little like giving a tourist directions that reference where a Dunkin' Donuts shop &lt;em&gt;used to be.&lt;/em&gt;  These names are useful in getting the attention from the old guard but they exclude the newbies.  This may be an intentional community dynamic where new members need to demonstrate their commitment in order to get accepted and longstanding members feel bonded by their shared knowledge.  But, if the goal is to bring outsiders in, the name of the project or an article should be clear and not overly silly and obscure.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br clear="all" /&gt;</content>

    <title>I Have Moved!</title>
    <content type='html'>My wife and I just moved the family to the town we grew up in: &lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;amp;q=northampton,+ma&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;om=1&amp;ll=42.326062,-72.641602&amp;amp;spn=3.342206,9.299927"&gt;Northampton, Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;.   If you are in the area, let me know and we can get together.  I am looking forward to participating in user groups like I did back in Boston with &lt;a href="http://www.bostonphp.org/"&gt;BostonPHP&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://plone.meetup.com/1/"&gt;BostonPlone&lt;/a&gt;.  I am still working with &lt;a href="http://www.optaros.com"&gt;Optaros&lt;/a&gt; so I plan to be in the Boston area for work with some frequency - it's less than 2 hours away.</content>

    <title>Too Dry Anti-Pattern</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I do a lot of code reviews.  On average, I probably spend an hour a day looking at diffs.  I find this an efficient use of time because I frequently spot bugs that wouldn't be revealed by regular testing.  I can also prevent implementations that will create obstacles as we progress through the road map.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-pattern"&gt;anti-patterns&lt;/a&gt; that I have started to notice is what I call the "Too DRY Anti-Pattern."  For the uninitiated, DRY stands for "Don't Repeat Yourself".  It is a primary tenet in one of my favorite books: &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/020161622X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=020161622X&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=contenthere-20&amp;linkId=EEQKRFOE4EFAJXKX"&gt;The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=contenthere-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=020161622X" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /&gt;.  Keeping your code DRY means using methods and functions rather than copying and pasting code and not storing the same information in multiple places.  I have written about &lt;a href="http://contenthere.net/2010/07/keeping-your-content-dry.html"&gt;DRY in terms of content management&lt;/a&gt; in this blog before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Too DRY anti-pattern starts with the good intention of keeping the code DRY.  The developer creates a function or method to avoid having the same code exist in lots of places.  However, over time the developer starts to use that function in places that do not quite fit.  The function gets more parameters and has increasingly complex internal logic to control its behavior in different cases.  Too DRY functions are easy to spot.  They have lots of intricate if-then logic that try to address a wide diversity of usage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;A counter-weight to the Too DRY anti-pattern is the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy"&gt;Unix philosophy of doing "one thing and doing it well."&lt;/a&gt;  When you run into a Too DRY function, use the Unix "one thing" philosophy to break it down.  Perhaps create smaller functions that do specific elements of the larger Too Dry function and then have different functions that use those building blocks in different ways.  Also, repeating code isn't always a bad thing if the code is small and performs a discrete function.  For example, if you have some code that creates an object and sets its properties, it is OK to have similar instances of this logic if the properties need to be set to different values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like all things, best practices need to be applied thoughtfully rather than as rigid rules.  So keep your code DRY, but not at the expense of simplicity.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Nice Article on Selecting Open Source Software</title>
    <content type='html'>The &lt;a href="http://eosj.com/issues-pdf/EOSJ.May-June06.pdf"&gt;latest issue of Enterprise Open Source Journal&lt;/a&gt;  has a nice article by Edmon Begoli ("Strategies for Success With Open Source Projects")  on selecting open source software.   Edmon starts by explaining that, like with commercial software, you need to consider your requirements.  After that, he suggests some additional steps that apply to examining open source.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Understanding our own technology capabilities will help you determine what kind of support you need&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Understand the organization behind the project.  Edmon gives a nice categorization scheme of Institutional (e.g. Apache), Commercially Sponsored (e.g. MySQL),  and  Independent (such as community supported projects).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Understand what is going on with the project.  Here is where you take advantage of the openness of open source.  Look at the bug lists and mailing lists and examine the architectural vision of the project by reviewing a project roadmap.  You can also get a good idea of architectural vision by reading the development list and learning the technical philosophy of the developers).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Another thing I like about the article is the perspective of managing risk.  Identify the risk tolerance of your initiative (will lives be lost if there is a bug?) and understand the potential benefits of working with newer and open technologies that you can contribute to.   The article also recommends contributing back enhancements.</content>

    <title>Why CMS Vendor Acquisitions are Bad for Customers</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;It just occurred to me that my recent quotes on &lt;a href="http://www.fiercecontentmanagement.com/"&gt;Fierce Content Management&lt;/a&gt; make me sound like the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statler_and_Waldorf"&gt;Statler and Waldorf&lt;/a&gt; of the content management industry.  I really don't mean to sound so negative but, from where I sit, software company acquisitions are nearly always bad news.  My clients are software customers and my job is to help them be better software customers by making better technology decisions.  Mainstream software analysts, who are mainly speaking to the vendors, spin acquisitions in terms of what it means to competitors.  They talk about how the acquisition changes the landscape and competitive dynamics.  Mainstream analysts get pretty excited by mergers and acquisitions.  It means that there is movement that needs to be understood and explained.  It means that they get to re-answer the question that their software vendor and investor customers always ask "who is the best &lt;em&gt;company&lt;/em&gt; in the market and why."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The software customer has a different question: "which one of these &lt;em&gt;products&lt;/em&gt; is the best &lt;em&gt;for me&lt;/em&gt; right now and in the foreseeable future."  Market dominance plays a role but customers should be more concerned about their requirements and that the vendor will stick around and continue to focus on what matters to the customer.  Customers should care less about who acquired who (today and yesterday) and about more who is at risk of getting acquired tomorrow.  Acquisition adds uncertainty and risk that a customer would do best to avoid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dirty little secret about software company acquisitions is that, in most cases, they have nothing to do with technology.  When one software company buys another, it is usually buying customers.  &lt;em&gt;Implicit in the transaction is the understanding that the customers are worth something and the acquiring company &lt;strong&gt;can more effectively make a profit from them&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An acquired CMS customer is valuable because switching costs are really high.  To switch to another  product, a customer would need to rebuild its web site, migrate its content, and retrain its people.  Unless the product is &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2008/03/serena-finally-has-a-plan-for-collage.html"&gt;totally doomed&lt;/a&gt;, the customer will probably stick around and pay support and maintenance for a for a while.  The acquiring company can increase profitability by cutting down on product development, support, and sales.  Most of these cut-backs directly affect the customer.  The vision for the product will get cloudy.  Enhancements will come out slower.  Technical support and professional services will be less knowledgeable.  Market-share will gradually decline.  In some cases, the product will be totally retired in favor of an alternative offering by the same company.  If there is an option of terminating support and maintenance, it is probably a good idea to exercise that option because the value of the service is likely to decline steadily.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sad thing is that this dynamic is practically built into the traditional software company business model.  A typical software company burns through investments to first build a product and then build a customer base.  At a certain point, the growth trajectory will flatten (or decline) and investors will want to move their money into another growth opportunity.  Some companies will be satisfied by having achieved a sustainable business.  Others will cash out by being acquired.  Others will look to grow by acquiring steady (but declining) revenue streams.  The scariest companies to deal with are the acquiring companies &amp;mdash; what I call "&lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2008/12/vendor-risk.html"&gt;portfolio companies&lt;/a&gt;" that buy up products for their customers and then decide what to do with the technology.  When you are a customer of one of these companies the future of the software you bought is vulnerable to the shifting attention of the vendor.  If the vendor decides to keep the product around, it means they can successfully drain revenue from you.  If the vendor gives you a "migration plan," it means that they have another product that is in an earlier stage of the same destiny.  Neither case is good.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>My Growing Data Science Toolkit</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;br /&gt;
At Aberdeen, I am taking vast amounts of data and working them into a unified data model that encompasses company information, web traffic, survey results, etc.. The actual workflow is nicely summarized in this classic dataists post called “&lt;a href="http://www.dataists.com/2010/09/a-taxonomy-of-data-science/"&gt;A Taxonomy of Data Science&lt;/a&gt;”: OSEMN (Obtain, Scrub, Explore, Model, iNterpret).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Here are the tools and tricks that I use on a daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
Command Line Tools&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;
Massive data files are troublesome for most editing programs (such as Excel or even VIM). It takes too much memory to hold all of that data in an editable state. Command line tools don’t have this problem because they work with data as a stream so they only need to load one line at a time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Kade Killary wrote an excellent article called “&lt;a href="https://medium.com/@kadek/command-line-tricks-for-data-scientists-c98e0abe5da"&gt;Command Line &amp;nbsp;Tricks for Data Scientists&lt;/a&gt;” . The tips range from simple to advanced. On the simple end, I learned about “wc -l” &amp;nbsp;which is the fastest way to get the number of lines in a file. Split is also a simple but powerful command for doing things like breaking up a large file into smaller batches for things like &lt;a href="https://www.mturk.com/"&gt;Mechanical Turk&lt;/a&gt; (more on that later).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When working with CSV files (the lingua franca of data science), I couldn’t live without &lt;a href="http://csvkit.readthedocs.io/en/1.0.3/"&gt;CSVKit&lt;/a&gt;. It doesn’t do anything you can’t do with AWK but the syntax is optimized for working with CSV files and is much simpler. For example, “csvcut -n filename.csv” lists the names of each column in filename.csv. “csvcut -c 1,3,4 filename.csv &amp;gt; newfile.csv” exports columns 1,3, and 4 into a new CSV file called newfile.csv. csvformat is useful for handling delimiters and escapes so that the file can be ingested by other systems.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As an aside, I always work with plain text formats such as CSV because they are more accessible to different tools than binary formats such as Excel.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
Mechanical Turk&lt;/h2&gt;
Most data scientists throw away data that they can identify as bad. Unfortunately, I don’t have that luxury. For example, if I discover that the URL we have a company is incorrect, I need to fix it because I use domain to link to other data. But what do you do if you have over 100,000 missing or bad URLs? Automation can only take you so far. After a certain point, you need an actual human to do some research. &amp;nbsp;I have found that Mechanical Turk is the fastest way to get help with these manual tasks. Using Mechanical Turk effectively is an art that I am just starting to get proficient with.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
Git&lt;/h2&gt;
When working with data files, there is a tendency to save copies in various steps in the process so you can compare what has changed, recover from a mistake, or take a different approach. Before long, you get directories full of cryptically named files. Some people have developed good systems for organizing and naming these files but I think the best approach is to use a source control system like GIT. &amp;nbsp; With GIT, you can commit a version of the same file with a comment about what you did with it. And, of course, Git helps you work with others.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
VisualDiffer&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;
While GIT comes with comparison functionality to show the difference between versions, I don’t think it is particularly easy to use. &lt;a href="http://visualdiffer.com/"&gt;VisualDiffer&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;is a cheap and simple tool to show side-by-side comparisons of text files like CSV. More advanced (and expensive) tools like Beyond Compare, Araxis, and DeltaWalker can handle binary formats such as Excel and even merge differences. But I have not found a need for those yet. My most common use case is to see changes that a script or someone else made to a file.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
AWS&lt;/h2&gt;
I use a lot of AWS tools in my work. S3, DynamoDB, Lambda…. At the bare minimum EC2 is a quick and cheap way to set up a computer that I can execute a long running process on. For example, I have one automated process that goes through hundreds of thousands of records and uses various APIs to gather additional data. The process literally took weeks. Using EC2 and screen sessions is infinitely better than chaining my own workstation to an internet connection and having it run continuously for days.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
Pandas and Jupyter Notebooks&lt;/h2&gt;
Since I am already a Python programmer, Pandas and Jupyter Notebooks were an obvious choice for exploring and modeling data. I love how you can build a step by step annotated process to assemble and visualize the data.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
PowerBI&lt;/h2&gt;
At Aberdeen, we add another step onto the end of the OSEMN process: Publish. This is where we use the output of our research to deliver interactive data products to our customers. Those products include embeddable dashboards and alerts that customers can use to make better decisions and seize opportunities. PowerBI is a rapidly improving platform for delivering interactive reports. We have PowerBI experts on staff so I mainly send data for them to turn into customer facing tools.&lt;br /&gt;

    <title>Business Time</title>
    <content type='html'>Clients frequently request that I run my calendar on their calendaring systems so that they can schedule me for meetings.  I can't really do this because I work for a number of clients and I use my calendar to manage my non-client work and my personal activities.  I have a hard enough time managing my time.  I don't need the additional burden of replicating the same information in multiple closed systems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My new work-around is using &lt;a href="http://spanningsync.com"&gt;Spanning Sync&lt;/a&gt; (SS) to synchronize my local iCal calendar with a Google Calendar that shows busy times to the general public.  So far the solution looks promising but there are some compromises that I have had to make.  The biggest one is that I like to have personal and work on different calendars within iCal.  SS only does a one-to-one mapping between iCal and Google Calendars so I had to merge my local calendars into one to get a single, public free/busy Google calendar.  I recently noticed that iCal allows you to create "groups" of calendars and I was hoping that SS would synchronize a group of calendars as one calendar.  Of course, since SS does bi-directional synchronization, this wouldn't really work (how would SS know which iCal calendar to put an event that came from  Google Calendar?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other compromise is that I had to make my calendar open to the world.  I would have preferred to only share it with people I choose.  It seems that I can only share with other registered Google users (which is probably everyone but on principle I don't like to force people to register for anything).  The public URL is relatively long and obscure but I am sure it is guessable.  This is not a huge issue because I am only sharing when I have meetings not what I am doing.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am wondering what other people are doing when faced with similar requirements.</content>

    <title>Zope Foundation</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;The Zope Corporation recently &lt;a href="http://mail.zope.org/pipermail/zope-announce/2005-June/001744.html"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; the creation of the Zope Foundation which is to be launched in October 2005.  The Zope Foundation will be a non-profit that will oversee Zope community projects including Zope 2, Zope 3, and CMF.  Copyrights of the Zope code will be transferred from Zope Corporation to the Zope Foundation. The Zope Foundation will also get a perpetual license to the Zope trademarks and take over management of &lt;a href="http://www.zope.org"&gt;zope.org&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information, you can join an IRC Session:&lt;br /&gt;- Who:  Zope Corp and Zope Community&lt;br /&gt;- What: IRC session to discuss the Zope Foundation&lt;br /&gt;- When: Tue, 21 Jun 2005 10a - 12p (US EDT)&lt;br /&gt;- Where: irc.freenode.net #zope&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creating a foundation is a frequently used (remember, TYPO3 recently announced the &lt;a href="http://association.typo3.org/"&gt;TYPO3 Association&lt;/a&gt;) and effective strategy for open source projects.  Doing so makes the governance of the project more public and reduces the perception that contributions are benefiting a specific company.  Other examples of this trend include Wyona moving the Lenya project over to the Apache Software Foundation, and Mambo moving out from under Miro International.  In both cases, the project enjoyed increased attention and participation.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>When remote working doesn't work</title>
    <content type='html'>As a long time remote worker and manager of both distributed and co-located teams, I think about virtual teams a lot. While I have had great personal experiences with remote teams, there seems to be little consensus about whether it is a good idea. You have some articles touting the health, retention, and productivity benefits of letting people work from home. And you have other articles, like the recent Atlantic piece "&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/11/when-working-from-home-doesnt-work/540660/"&gt;When working from home doesn't work&lt;/a&gt;," that indicate a shift back to traditional office environments. Based on my own experience, I find it hard to imagine large companies succeeding by dictating enterprise-wide policies around remote workers. &amp;nbsp;The effectiveness of distributed teams depend on critical factors that will vary from team to team. Here are three things that undermine the effectiveness of distributed teams.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
1. Hybrid teams do not work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
A team should be either all colocated or all remote. A remote member of a predominantly colocated team will always be neglected. It is unavoidable. Co-located employees build habits that depend on seeing each other. They look around the room to decide who to include in a discussion. They respond to visual clues that a&amp;nbsp;colleague may be struggling. The interactions that are available to remote team members tend to be restricted to events that are either boring (like standing meetings) or stressful (like performance reviews). But relationships are formed in between these two extremes when people can be themselves and have the space to curious about each other and build trust.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
2. You can't convert a colocated team to a distributed one&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
A team is not just a collection of people. It is an ecosystem that is shaped by individual talent, chemistry, goals, and an environment that presents constraints and opportunities. The environment plays a huge role in how people interact. And by interact, I don't just mean communication (although that is part of it) but also how responsibilities are divided and handoffs happen. If all of the sudden people start working remotely, you need to treat the group as a new team. You need to establish new norms and ways of working together. Roles will change. You need to use different methods to develop camaraderie and create an engaging work experience.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
3. Not everyone will thrive as a remote worker&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
It takes a special type of person to be an effective and happy remote worker. Their work environment has to be conducive to productivity. They need to be goal oriented and invested in the success of the team. They should be committed to their craft and want to build mastery by continuous refinement. I have also recently begun to appreciate the importance of being in the right phase of one's career. At some point in your career, it is helpful to go into an office to do things like: build professional social skills; find a mentor; bond with people; try different roles; get lots of feedback; and have the general sensation that you work for a company. It is harder for remote workers to advance into new roles because they don't get to see other people doing those roles. Personally, I am grateful that I got to work at a number of different kinds of offices and I have some great professional connections from that time. I think I would be a wreck if my early managers had to deliver feedback over phone and email without being able to modulate tone and provide support based on my reaction.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Based on these three observations, a smart executive will not dictate working style based on business journal articles or office leases. Instead, he/she should empower teams to construct and distribute/consolidate themselves for optimal efficiency.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Preventing Source Language Bleed-Through</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;When considering a &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2012/02/introduction-to-translation-proxies.html"&gt;translation proxy&lt;/a&gt; to localize a website, people often ask "if we change the content on the site, what will visitors see while the translators are working on the new translations?" Unless you are using machine translation as a backstop for untranslated content, your source language is going to show through.  This is because a translation proxy doesn't cache full pages.  Instead, they apply translations one fragment at a time.  If it doesn't have a translation for a fragment, the translation proxy will register it as a new string to translate and send the original text through.  This is a necessary trade-off to support dynamic websites.  You can shorten the period of bleed-through by increasing your translation responsiveness and throughput, but to prevent bleed entirely you need apply one of the following techniques.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;These two techniques are really just variations on the same theme of pointing the proxy at two versions of your site: one for content discovery and another one for production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;International Snapshot&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The "international snapshot" approach is where you create a non-current snapshot of your production site for international audiences.  Depending on your translation velocity, this could be anywhere from a day old to a month old or more.  Content discovery and translation is still done on the live site.  But when an external visitor browses the site, they are getting a proxy-translated view of the snapshot.  There is no bleed-through from the snapshot site because by the time the snapshot is refreshed, all of the translation rules have already been published.  Here is a picture&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sggottlieb/8413982487/" title="International Snapshot Model by sggottlieb, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8515/8413982487_0a937e43e2.jpg" width="500" height="288" alt="International Snapshot Model"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is what we are doing for the new &lt;a href="http://www.lionbridge.com"&gt;www.lionbridge.com website&lt;/a&gt;.  We wrote some scripts to do a full snapshot of the site (code, database, and other files) to another virtual host on the same servers.  If you are using a more sophisticated platform than Wordpress, you could probably set up another publishing target and just publish there when you want to update your snapshot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Translate Staging&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The "translate staging" option follows the same pattern as international snapshot.  With translate staging, however, you do your content discovery and translation on the staging server (which has content which hasn't been published yet) so your translations are ready &lt;em&gt;before you publish your content&lt;/em&gt;. Once your translation queue is down to zero, you can publish your source content to your live site and the translation rules will be waiting to be used. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sggottlieb/8414009345/" title="Translate Staging Model by sggottlieb, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8358/8414009345_30c572a20b.jpg" width="500" height="288" alt="Translate Staging Model"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;With "translate staging," you need to make sure:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Your staging site is publicly accessible.  You will not be able to view the site through the proxy unless it is available on the public internet.  For security reasons, you can limit access with a firewall and also add authentication to the staging site.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;Your staging site only contains translation ready content.  If you have are using your staging site for your editorial process, you might wind up discovering draft content that will never be published.  Since this is obviously a waste of time and money, it's best to create a staging instance that only has content that is ready for publishing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is a summary of the process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sggottlieb/8445666404/" title="Lifecycle of a content update by sggottlieb, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8371/8445666404_b6607263ca.jpg" width="500" height="308" alt="Lifecycle of a content update"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What to choose?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which approach is right for you depends on your requirements.  If, because of regulations or communications policy, you are required to publish new content to all languages simultaneously, you need to go with the translate staging option.  If, like it is with us, you can allow your localized sites to lag behind the primary site, the international snapshot option is usually most attractive.  And, of course, letting source content leak through may be acceptable if your site is less formal.  The most important thing is that you have options.  &lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type='html'>This is an interesting post; I ignored when I first read, as I&amp;#39;m pretty familiar with both Interwoven and open source (being VP Product Management at Interwoven for 10 years and most recently VP Product Management at Alfresco).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Implementation times for open source - specifically Alfresco - versus Interwoven for base WCM (read:  TeamSite and OpenDeploy) are not higher.  The additional functionality you have to build into an open source product in Interwoven&amp;#39;s case isn&amp;#39;t free:  you have to buy additional products like LiveSite, MetaTagger, Targeting, WorkSite, MediaBin ... the list goes on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Aside from those licensing costs, you also need to account for training different development teams on different APIs and managing multiple repositories, workflow systems, and more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think the person that wrote this (Annie) is talking about the nicely packaged demos pre-built by a crack SE team ... regular customers, however, don&amp;#39;t deploy SE demos.  They need to invest in lots of licensed products and figure out how to build and manage everything on their own.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Like I said, I ignored this because I thought it was a bit laughable.  But it&amp;#39;s good that you&amp;#39;ve highlighted Seth.  Annie isn&amp;#39;t referring to just base TeamSite.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think this post proves that Interwoven still doesn&amp;#39;t get open source, and worse, Interwoven is fighting against the open source wave (which is unfortunate, because it is critical to the future of robust and usable enterprise software).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kevin Cochrane&lt;br&gt;CMO, Day Software</content>

    <title>OpenCms V7 RC 1 Available</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;If you have been holding out for OpenCms to come out with version 7, your wait is almost over.   The OpenCms team &lt;a href="http://www.opencms.org/opencms/en/shownews.html?id=1195"&gt;just announced&lt;/a&gt; that the first release candidate (RC1) is available in CVS and will soon be packaged for download on &lt;a href="http://www.opencms.org"&gt;www.opencms.org&lt;/a&gt;.  The stable version is expected to be out in July.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For perspective, v7 is probably as big an upgrade as v6 (released 2 years ago) was over v5.  Whereas v6 introduced in-site editing functionality (called "Direct Edit") and better support for structured content, v7 brings goodies like WebDAV support (now developers can use their favorite IDE to edit presentation templates!) and a dependency engine that will do a better job of managing links and automatically publish related content (so an image will be published if the article that references it is published).  Version 7 will also have much improved user management.  For a list of other enhancements, check out the &lt;a href="http://www.opencms.org/opencms/en/shownews.html?id=1195"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Silos everywhere</title>
    <content type='html'>It is fairly typical for a consultant or new leader to walk into an organization and see nothing but silos. These leaders regard silos as a barrier to efficiency and make them a target for change. What they often wind up doing is replacing organically formed structures with new ones that look better on powerpoint than in practice.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Why does this happen? Let's start by digging into what a silo is. "Silo" is usually used as a derogatory term to describe a grouping that you don't like. But groupings are important in large organizations because the number of possible point to point connections makes communication too noisy and prioritization too difficult. If everyone is talking to everyone all the time, nothing gets done. Teams naturally form to confront this challenge. Complementary capabilities are assembled and scaled in highly focused work groups. Process is continuously refined because of a tight feedback loop.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To the outsider, trying to navigate these structures is confusing and frustrating. People seem unaware of what is happening outside of their group. They appear oblivious rather than focused. The reactionary impulse is to criticize the duplication of what appear to be identical functions. The ego feels good when you think you see obvious dysfunction that nobody else recognizes. It certainly feels better than having to slog through complexity that everyone else understands.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But there is great risk in introducing sweeping plans to achieve synergy before really understanding how these teams function. Even if the reasoning is valid, it is incredibly disruptive to blow up any working system and make it re-form under stress and uncertainty.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Before eliminating "silos," you need to understand why they formed. Were they imposed from the top down in order to make the organization easier to understand from the top? Or did these structures develop naturally to solve operational problems related to coordination and focus? Can the same benefits be achieved more efficiently?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You can't fix a working system until you fully understand why it is the way it is. You need to understand what is working right now and what obstacles stood in the way from the system naturally adapting to solve its broken parts. When you hypothesize dysfunction, you need to introduce your corrections scientifically and measure the results. But most importantly, you need to find the best parts and figure out a way to expand on them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

    <title>Some upcoming conferences</title>
    <content type='html'>I have been planning some trips for upcoming conferences.  Here is my schedule for the next couple of months.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I will be an innocent bystander at &lt;a href="http://boston2008.drupalcon.org/"&gt;Drupalcon&lt;/a&gt; next week in Boston (March 3-6).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I will be in Cologne for &lt;a href="http://www.opencms-days.org/en/index.html"&gt;OpenCms Days&lt;/a&gt; May 5th and 6th &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/products-page/reports/open-source-content-management-in-java"&gt;to give a presentation on what all the other open source Java web CMS are doing&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In June (17th and 18th), I will be in Chicago for &lt;a href="http://www.webcontent2008.com/"&gt;Web Content 2008&lt;/a&gt; to present &lt;a href="http://www.webcontent2008.com/program_detail/web_content_management_deployment_patterns/"&gt;"Will Your Next Web Platform Be Free?: A Guide to the Open Source Web Content Management Landscape"&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In November, I will be Aarhus, Denmark for &lt;a href="http://www.jboye08.dk/"&gt;jboye08&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are also some conferences that I would love to attend but will sadly miss.  In particular:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://webcontentmavens.com/"&gt;The Web Content Mavens&lt;/a&gt; of Washington, DC &lt;a href="http://webcms.meetup.com/39/calendar/7089391/"&gt;are having a meetup&lt;/a&gt; tomorrow (February 27th) on open source web content management technologies.  I can't be there but &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net"&gt;Content Here&lt;/a&gt; is sponsoring.  If you go, tell me how the pizza is ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://2008.sxsw.com/interactive/"&gt;South By Southwest Interactive&lt;/a&gt; in Austin March 7-11.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://javasymposium.techtarget.com/lasvegas/"&gt;The Server Side Java Symposium in Las Vegas&lt;/a&gt; March 26-28.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I might try to make it to the &lt;a href="http://en.oreilly.com/webexny2008/public/content/home"&gt;Web 2.0 Web Expo in NY&lt;/a&gt; September 16-18th.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anything else I should be thinking about?</content>

    <title>Retro-Fitting Your WCM System for Localization</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Not long ago, I wrote a post called &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2012/04/planning-for-localization.html"&gt;Planning for Localization&lt;/a&gt; to give tips for enabling internationalization even if localization is not part of your initial launch requirements.  As I mentioned before, internationalization is one of those requirements that gets de-scoped with much regret later on. How bad is it?  In my experience, enabling internationalization post launch is often a non-starter.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work involved breaks down into 4 categories:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Presentation template localization.&lt;/strong&gt; Swapping out static strings for references to resource bundles or creating language-specific variants of templates. The level of effort depends on the number of templates and the extent to which they have static text.  Text within images is particularly bad because finding the source files can be a real challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Repository re-organization.&lt;/strong&gt;  There may be some work to re-organize the content hierarchy.  For example, you might want to drop the primary language down from the root node to make room for other languages.  This may affect the &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2012/02/url-management-for-a-global-business.html"&gt;URL structure&lt;/a&gt; and you might need to do URL rewrites.  Different platforms have different strategies for handling multi-lingual content.  In the best case scenario, every asset has the built-in capability of being multi-lingual.  In the worst case, the repository doesn't support internationalization at all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Workflow updates.&lt;/strong&gt; This is work to update the workflows to add steps for localization or triggers to instantiate a translation workflow when the asset in the pivot language changes. There is also an organizational aspect here.  Often you need to have someone with both the language.skills and access to the staging area to preview localized content before publication.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Language fall-back logic and other multi-lingual configurations.&lt;/strong&gt; This is kind of a catch all for any type configuration that you would skip on a mono-lingual website and only do for a localized website.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;I asked around my network of systems integrators for their experiences and they are consistent with mine.  Several of my colleagues said that an internationalization retro-fit often costs as much as a complete do-over.  That can be in the &lt;strong&gt;$200,000 to $400,000&lt;/strong&gt; range.  You might also need to &lt;strong&gt;add another couple hundred thousand dollars&lt;/strong&gt; to license a new WCMS if your current platform doesn't have strong internationalization support.  Others came in a lower worst case scenario of around 50% of the initial implementation cost.  Of course, the level of effort depends on the size and complexity of the site, the native internationalization capability of the platform, and the number of internationalization corners that were cut in the initial implementation.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem is that you don't really know the extent of re-work involved until you start the project and dig into the code. Sites that have been around a while often have functionality or display templates that are rarely or never used.  You still need to internationalize them just in case.  Also, if you are working with a new systems integrator, they need to assume that the initial implementer didn't know what they were doing and buried &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_smell"&gt;stinky code&lt;/a&gt; all over the place.  It's a bit like when you open up a wall for a small home project and you realize that some serious structural problems need to be addressed before you do anything else.  So any fixed-bid proposal is going to be based on a worst case scenario of having to do extensive refactoring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The systems integrators in my network have started to plan for internationalization in all of their projects.  They ignore their client's request for a U.S. English-only website because eventually someone is going to realize the market potential of U.S. Spanish or opportunities for global expansion.  If you are building a new website, make sure that your systems integrator thinks this way.  If you are considering internationalizing your mono-lingual site by adding a new locale, the most practical solution is to deploy a &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2012/02/introduction-to-translation-proxies.html"&gt;translation proxy&lt;/a&gt;, which hosts the translations &lt;em&gt;outside&lt;/em&gt; of your website. This means that no retrofitting is required and you can avoid all of that expensive and risky rework.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>CMSWire Open Source CMS Survey</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://www.cmswire.com"&gt;CMSWire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.waterandstone.com/"&gt;Water and Stone&lt;/a&gt; are conducting a &lt;a href="http://bit.ly/24GJES"&gt;survey of open source CMS users and implementers&lt;/a&gt; for an upcoming report on Open Source CMS Market Share.  I don't generally put much stock in CMS popularity contests because they tend to favor products that address the lowest common denominator requirements (that is, brochure websites for sole proprietor-size businesses).  That said, I took the survey and was pleasantly surprised with the depth of information that they are collecting.  In particular, I am interested to know what people consider the most important market filters and also implementation details like the length and cost of implementation.  I hope they include this information in the report.  I also hope that "industrial grade" implementers and customers take part so that the results show a good cross section of the marketplace.  As a participation incentive, there is an opportunity to win a $100 iTunes gift certificate.  How can you pass that up?</content>

    <title>New look</title>
    <content type='html'>I was planning to update the look of this site as a surprise for my 100th post (not too far away).  However, I just couldn't bear the look of it anymore.  My colleague, Steve Zimmerman, a great designer but hesitant author (I am still working on him), volunteered his template because he couldn't stand my "brand" either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me know what you think.</content>

    <title>Workflow in CMS and Beyond</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Depending on who you talk to, Workflow is a core feature of a Content Management System.  Many people looking for a CMS have Workflow in their selection criteria and many products calling themselves a CMS have Workflow on their feature lists.  However, after experiencing workflow as a both a requirement and as a solution, I have learned that people's definition varies widely.  For some products, having the most basic of approval mechanisms (two states: unpublished and published and a designated group of users that can change that state) is enough to claim workflow.  At the other end of the spectrum, other products fully implement workflow standards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.wfmc.org"&gt;Workflow Management Coalition (WfMC)&lt;/a&gt; publishes a document called their &lt;a href="http://www.wfmc.org/standards/model.htm"&gt;Reference Model&lt;/a&gt; that describes workflow as "The computerised facilitation or automation of a business process, in whole or in part."  This is pretty general (although I am sure there are some who would say that workflow is just about business processes and not about computers.).  Workflow is commonly discussed as a set of states and transitions.  A state, or "wait state," is a step in the process that requires action from external actor.  A transition is an action that changes from one state to another.  A workflow definition, describes a set of states and transitions and their relationships (the transitions are available from each state, the participants can initiate these transitions, and the required conditions for those transitions to happen) and also inputs and data that get captured along the way.  A workflow instance is the execution of the process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his &lt;a href="http://www.theserverside.com"&gt;Server Side&lt;/a&gt; article &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theserverside.com/articles/article.tss?l=Workflow"&gt;The State of Workflow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, Tom Baeyens describes a Workflow Management System as something "that takes as input a formal description of business processes and maintains the state of processes executions, thereby delegating activities amongst people and applications."  Many CMS do not fully implement the concept of a workflow definition.  What they call workflow is more of a task management system where any user can assign a task to anyone and no formal process is followed. &lt;a href="http://www.cmsmatrix.org"&gt;CMS Matrix&lt;/a&gt; is somewhat reliable in evaluating this feature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to learn more about workflow theory, there are some excellent resources available.  One of my favorites is &lt;a href="http://www.workflowpatterns.com/"&gt;Workflow Patterns&lt;/a&gt; which describes different patterns in workflow definitions along with very cool Flash movies that illustrate the behavior of the pattern.  I think that patterns are useful here because they provide a language of commonly found workflow parts.  So when I say something like &lt;a href="http://tmitwww.tm.tue.nl/research/patterns/synchronizing_merge.htm"&gt;"Synchronizing Merge"&lt;/a&gt;, you know exactly what I am talking about.  Some people will call this jargon but I think it is a good thing because it gives a shorthand way to express familiar concepts.  The Workflow Patterns site also has an excellent &lt;a href="http://tmitwww.tm.tue.nl/research/patterns/documentation.htm"&gt;reading&lt;/a&gt; list&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many products (Open and Closed Source) which specialize solely in Workflow.  These workflow engines integrate with other applications to provide workflow functionality.  Most of them have a syntax (usually XML based) for defining workflows and an API that is able to receive events and trigger external processes.  If you are looking at implementing a CMS only for the workflow, and your workflow is sufficiently complex and subject to change, you should consider this type of solution.  Look &lt;a href="http://dmoz.org/Computers/Software/Workflow/Products/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for a list of products.  Another useful feature on the Workflow Patterns site is a &lt;a href="http://tmitwww.tm.tue.nl/research/patterns/products.htm"&gt;page&lt;/a&gt; that indicates what patterns the major commercial Workflow engines support.  When I get around to it, I would love to evaluate some Open Source workflow engines along these lines.  Speaking of Open Source Workflow engines, &lt;a href="http://www.manageability.org/blog/stuff/workflow_in_java/view"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; is a list of engines implemented in Java.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The industry is rich with standards especially in the area of Web Services which has the potential to coordinate workflows across application boundaries.  One of the most interesting standards is &lt;a href="http://www.wfmc.org/standards/XPDL.htm"&gt;XPDL&lt;/a&gt; which is published by WfMC.  This is an XML schema that is used by several workflow engines to define workflows.  The presence of a standard here means that you could theoretically port your workflow from one engine to another simply be moving a file.  I emphasize &lt;b&gt;theoretically&lt;/b&gt; here.  Several workflow engines (Open Source and proprietary) use XPDL but, to my knowledge, no CMS does.  It may be that XPDL is overkill for your typical CMS workflow definition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that I have gotten you all excited about workflow, I would like to leave you with some very practical and sobering advice: less is more.  Usually during the analysis stage of a project, workflows become very complicated.  There are many factors that drive complexity: the fear of excluding stakeholders from the project, the fear of losing control, overblown promises when the project is sold, and just simply bad business process.  More often then not, after painstakingly implementing complex workflows, I am asked to rip them out in favor of very simple solutions before the system is deployed because it is impossible to get anything published.  Think about simplifying/streamlining/optimizing business processes before they are encoded into a workflow definition. Don't design for the most complex, infrequently used cases.  Instead suggest managing these exceptional cases off line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Drupal Panels Tutorial</title>
    <content type='html'>Readers of the &lt;a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/77085653/Drupal-for-Publishers"&gt;Drupal for Publishers&lt;/a&gt; know that &lt;a href="http://drupal.org"&gt;Drupal&lt;/a&gt; lacks a native system for associating different page layouts for different sections or pages on a site.  Sub-layouts are typically implemented with conditional logic in the template code (page.tpl.php).  The &lt;a href="http://drupal.org/project/panels"&gt;Drupal Panels module&lt;/a&gt; puts this control in the administrative interface and is becoming widely used within the Drupal community.  To learn more, check out &lt;a href="http://gotdrupal.com/videos/drupal-panels"&gt;GotDrupal's excellent video tutorial on Drupal Panels.&lt;/a&gt;  As you can see from the video, the Panels user interface is quite powerful but is also very complicated because you have to create these rules to determine under what conditions a layout should display.  You still probably want a developer or well trained administrator to do the work on a staging environment and then migrate the configurations to the production environment.</content>

    <title>Plone Roadmap</title>
    <content type='html'>The &lt;a href="http://theploneblog.org"&gt;Plone Blog&lt;/a&gt; just &lt;a href="http://theploneblog.org/archive/2006/02/17/plone-roadmaps"&gt;published links to a road map&lt;/a&gt; that describes the next three releases of Plone:  a maintenance release (2.1.3), an infrastructure release (2.5), and the next major release (3.0).   It looks like release 2.5 will take more of the configuration that is currently done in the ZMI and put it into control panels within Plone.  There is quite a usability gap between the Plone administration pages and the underlying ZMI.  There will be a new &lt;a href="http://theploneblog.org/archive/2006/02/18/plones-new-framework-team"&gt;framework team&lt;/a&gt; setting the technical direction for Plone 3.0.  The new team consists of Wichert Akkerman, Martin Aspeli, Rocky Burt, Raphael Ritz, Hanno Schlichting, Vincenzo Di Somma, and Helge Tesdal.  Plone 3.0 is expected to have more AJAX based rich client functionality (&lt;a href="http://plone.org/documentation/whatsnew/2.1/livesearch"&gt;LiveSearch&lt;/a&gt;, which was released in 2.1, is great), &lt;a href="http://plone.org/products/plone/roadmap/122"&gt;QuickEdit&lt;/a&gt; (which allows content to be edited a field at a time), and a number of performance enhancements.  I was a little surprised that adding &lt;a href="http://plone.org/products/plone/roadmap/8"&gt;versioning to the core&lt;/a&gt; was not slated for this release.  For versioning, the product that I like the best is &lt;a href="http://www.emergence.com/WhatWeOffer/products/PVS"&gt;PVSForPlone2&lt;/a&gt;, although &lt;a href="http://plone.org/products/cmfeditions"&gt;CMFEditions&lt;/a&gt; seems to have the attention of Plone core developers.</content>

    <title>TYPO3 Association</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;TYPO3 announced today the creation of a Switzerland &lt;a href="http://typo3.org/community/typo3-association/"&gt;Typo3 Association&lt;/a&gt; which will serve as a holding organization which will help set direction for the product and handle financial and legal matters.  TYPO3 originator, Kasper SkÃ¥rhÃ¸j, heads the Association.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According the website, the TYPO3 Association was first founded in Fall of 2004.  It seems to be a slight variation on a trend of Open Source projects developing a foundation (such as the Apache Software Foundation and the Plone Foundation) to handle things like money and legal liability.  TYPO3'S Association appears to be organized more as a membership organization.  There are Active Members, who regularly contribute code, and Supporting Members (either companies or individuals), who pay membership fees.  Active Members have the right to vote on matters.  Supporting membership seems to be more of a vehicle for sponsorhsip.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first international TYPO3 conference (TYCON3) will take place in Karlsruhe, Germany in September 2005.  Two of the key initiatives that the TYPO3 Association will introduce are a certification program for individuals and developers, and adapting TYPO3 to international standards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TYPO3 has long been a well organized and very professional project.  It seems like the Association helps take TYPO3 a little farther by creating a more official legal entity behind the project.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>OSCMS Summit</title>
    <content type='html'>There will be an &lt;a href="http://2007.oscms-summit.org/"&gt;Open Source CMS Summit&lt;/a&gt; this Spring (March 22nd and 23rd) at &lt;a href="http://www.yahoo.com/"&gt;Yahoo&lt;/a&gt; headquarters in Sunnyvale, CA.  The &lt;a href="http://drupal.org/"&gt;Drupal&lt;/a&gt; project is spearheading it but all other projects are invited to participate.  With the decline of &lt;a href="http://www.oscom.org/"&gt;OSCOM&lt;/a&gt;, it is nice to see these kind of events happening.  Project teams learn from other projects' strengths and experiences.  Most of the current proposals are about &lt;a href="http://drupal.org/"&gt;Drupal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.packtpub.com/author_view_profile/id/116"&gt;Munwar Shariff&lt;/a&gt; is also planning to talk about &lt;a href="http://www.alfresco.com/"&gt;Alfresco&lt;/a&gt; (He just published an  &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAlfresco-Enterprise-Content-Management-Implementation%2Fdp%2F1904811116%2Fsr%3D1-1%2Fqid%3D1171245949%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks&amp;amp;amp;tag=contenthere-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325"&gt;Alfresco book&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=contenthere-20&amp;amp;amp;amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" alt="" style="border: medium none  ! important; margin: 0px ! important;" border="0" height="1" width="1" /&gt;.  Review from me coming soon).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might remember &lt;a href="http://drupal.org/"&gt;Drupal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://ez.no/"&gt;eZ publish&lt;/a&gt; put on a &lt;a href="http://drupal.org/conference-vancouver-2006"&gt;similar conference in Vancouver last year&lt;/a&gt;.   I found out about it pretty late, as did the general OSCOM community that was battling inertia of organizing a conference of their own.  I heard it was a great time.</content>

    <title>Great Backyard Plone Count</title>
    <content type='html'>Karl Horak, A.K.A. Schlepp, has started an initiative that he calls the &lt;a href="http://plonemetrics.blogspot.com/2009/02/great-backyard-plone-count.html"&gt;Great Backyard Plone Count - GBPC&lt;/a&gt;.  Modeled after the &lt;a href="http://www.birdsource.org/gbbc/"&gt;Audubon Society's Great Backyard Bird Count&lt;/a&gt;, the GBPC attempts to survey Plone sites &lt;em&gt;in the wild&lt;/em&gt;.  The general idea is that everyone in the Plone Community spends time each day during the sample period looking for sites running Plone.  I am a little to late to this as the dates for the count are February 13-16, 2009 so you will have to participate next year.  One thing that I think could improve the GBPC support materials is a listing of what to look for when trying to identify a Plone site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a web content management consultant, I have a keen interest in knowing the CMS behind the site.  In fact, I have a hard time visiting a site without trying to guess.  Over the years, I have developed an awareness of the various &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tell_(poker)"&gt;"tells"&lt;/a&gt; associated with the different CMS platforms.  I also like to keep a list of known sightings such as when &lt;a href="http://buytaert.net/tag/drupal-sites"&gt;Dries Buytaert posts announcements of new Drupal sitest&lt;/a&gt;.  I got all excited when &lt;a href="http://gadgetopia.com/"&gt;Deane Barker&lt;/a&gt; told me about the &lt;a href="http://www.backendinfo.com/"&gt;Backend Info Plugin for Firefox&lt;/a&gt; which is supposed to figure out what is running the site you are on.  What a letdown when I learned how few technologies it knows about!  It didn't even catch obvious tells like the &lt;a href="http://www.people.com/people/0,,,00.html"&gt;commas in the URLs&lt;/a&gt; of old &lt;a href="http://www.vignette.com/"&gt;Vignette&lt;/a&gt; Story Server sites or the word &lt;a href="http://www.realmadrid.com/cs/Satellite/en/Home"&gt;"Satellite" that appears in the URLs&lt;/a&gt; of so many &lt;a href="http://www.fatwire.com"&gt;FatWire&lt;/a&gt; sites.  It didn't even catch sites with "generator" meta tags.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since reading about the GBPC, I never realized how much like bird watching my "hobby" of CMS identification is (only probably less cool).  Does anyone else have this crazy hobby?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Edit] &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a title="GBPC Results" href="http://plonemetrics.blogspot.com/2009/02/gbpc-is-ovah.html"&gt;The results are in&lt;/a&gt;. Â People submitted 183 sites over the 96 hour collection period. Â It looks like around 40 people participated. Â Pretty good for a first go around. Â I would expect with some more publicity, this could initiative could return much more results. Â Karl did a sweep of Delicious links and found 2,326 tag with plone-site. Â Of course, the thing that this method has over Delicious is that it gets to the internal sites running Plone.</content>

    <title>Daisy 2.2 released. Kauri keeping Outerthought busy</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://outerthought.org"&gt;Outerthought&lt;/a&gt; recently announced &lt;a href="http://outerthought.org/blog/index/253-OTC.html"&gt;version 2.2 of their Daisy CMS platform&lt;/a&gt;.  One of the biggest improvements has been in the area of localization.  Daisy, with its "variants" model, has always been strong in managing multiple language renditions of a content asset.  With 2.2, Daisy has improved the way different translations of a document are kept in sync.  For example, if your native language is English, you may create many incremental English versions of an asset and translate the major versions into the secondary languages.  Daisy 2.2 allows you to map different versions of language variants and shows you when the mapped versions are not in sync.  For a better, more thorough explanation, see Bruno Dumon's &lt;a href="http://brunodumon.wordpress.com/2008/01/04/translation-management/"&gt;blog post on translation management&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that the Daisy 2.2 release has been ready to go for a while but the team has been working on a new web application framework called &lt;a href="http://outerthought.org/blog/index/237-OTC.html?branch=1&amp;language=3"&gt;Kauri&lt;/a&gt;.  I know what you are thinking: just what the world needs, another web application development framework.  Take comfort in knowing that they are not trying to re-invent everything.  They are re-using what they like but have decided to build their own &lt;a href="http://kauriproject.org/wiki/g1/58-kauri.html"&gt;runtime&lt;/a&gt; and their own &lt;a href="http://kauriproject.org/wiki/g1/g1/50-kauri.html"&gt;template language&lt;/a&gt;.  The runtime is based on a "&lt;a href="http://www.theserverside.com/news/thread.tss?thread_id=38290#195808"&gt;Restlet&lt;/a&gt;" (as opposed to servlet) architecture and seems pretty interesting. While servlet based frameworks may be considered to heavy weight for REST style architectures, I think departing from a well known standard (like the Servlet standard) should not be taken lightly. &lt;a href="http://www.noelios.com/"&gt;Noelios&lt;/a&gt;, the company behind &lt;a href="http://www.restlet.org"&gt;Restlets&lt;/a&gt;, is intending to take their Restlet API 2.0 through the Java Community Process this year (&lt;a href="http://blog.noelios.com/2007/04/25/restlet-api-and-jsr-311-api/"&gt;see blog post&lt;/a&gt;).  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The creation of a new templating language makes me a little uncomfortable.  While there is really no good standard other than JSP JSTL (not really a templating language in itself) and XSLT (too hard for most to learn), creating a new templating language (or any new language) is the developer equivalent of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jumping_the_shark"&gt;jumping the shark&lt;/a&gt; - an over the top attempt to break out of the status quo.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No templating language is perfect but there is value in working in an imperfect language that you know or that your IDE knows.  Most templating languages go through a natural lifecycle where they start out architecturally pure but limiting (and often a little slow and buggy too), then they achieve stability, then they start to get ruined by the desire add programming capabilities that spoils the separation between layout and business logic.  I would love to see a better standard in this area that will help slow the decay of a good templating language and bring some commonality between content management systems.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will try not to pass judgement on the Kauri template language before I see it and I would love to see something that would make me &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to teach it to a creative developer.  I guess you could say that I have a healthy skepticism.</content>

    <title>Should you host your intranet and corporate website on one platform?</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Often times by the time a client gets to finding me, they have reached a point where they are ready to throw away their entire web infrastructure: both their corporate website and their intranet.  They hope that one well executed product selection can solve both problems.  When approached by this kind of prospective client I am careful to set the expectation that this hope is probably not realistic &amp;mdash; not impossible, just not realistic.  That said, there are a few conditions where putting your intranet and external website on one stack does work.  Here are the criteria that I use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The intranet is informational rather than collaborative.&lt;/strong&gt;  Different people mean different things when they say the word "intranet."  For some, an intranet is just a collection of web pages that only employees can see.  Others think of tools and workspaces that allow employees to collaborate and get things done.  If you had the latter in mind, chances are you will be looking for a document management, ECM, or portal system like Sharepoint for knowledge worker collaboration.  These systems are technically capable of pure web publishing but that is not their strength.  Your website management team will feel constrained by a platform that treats web publishing as an afterthought.  If you think of your employees and customers/prospects simply as different audiences that you need to publish to, a single platform may work just fine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The company has other platforms on which to build specialized, dynamic web applications.&lt;/strong&gt;  Sooner or later (or probably already) your company is going to need to develop content-oriented web applications and your WCMS is a logical place to start.  However, these web applications are likely to introduce the most demanding and specialized requirements.  It is quite possible that the union of your intranet and external website application requirements filter out every viable CMS &amp;mdash; or at least force some painful compromises.  If you have an alternative stack on which to build your fancy custom applications (possibly pulling content from your WCMS) and can let your WCMS focus on simple web publishing, you greatly increase the chance that you can comfortably support both internal and external publishing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The corporate website and intranet are owned by one communications group.&lt;/strong&gt;  Today you may be able to align your intranet and external publishing needs; but will they stay aligned?  How will you arbitrate between the competing priorities of the intranet and marketing website?  What if those priorities don't just compete for resources but actually conflict with each other?  Things can get ugly when two different departments with different goals argue over what feature needs to be added next.  These decisions get a lot easier if both the intranet and external website are owned by one communications group.  Companies that are structured this way are usually small and can benefit the most from sharing the infrastructure cost between the intranet and extranet.  Having the intranet owned by a communications group also pretty much ensures that criterion 1 is satisfied.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your company meets these criteria, there is a good possibility that one instance of one CMS platform could serve you quite well.  Otherwise, I would recommend doing one of your two projects and then putting the product that you used on the short list of products to consider for the other.  If it turns out that the one platform supports the requirements of the second project, buy another instance of the software (hopefully at a discount) and start a new project to implement it.  Take advantage of code and idea re-use but don't let that constrain the flexibility and agility that you need to achieve your goals.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Russell Toris Wins the JCR Cup</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://www.cmswire.com/cms/events/day-software-awards-first-jcr-cup-winner-003854.php"&gt;via CMSWire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.day.com"&gt;Day Software&lt;/a&gt; recently announced the winner of the JCR 2008 Cup. &lt;a href="http://www.day.com/content/day/en/company/news_events/press_releases/day_jcr_cup_2008_winner.html"&gt;Russell Toris won the MacBook Pro grand prize for his web clipping application "Crux"&lt;/a&gt;.  While the idea is not all that innovative (it appears to be very similar to &lt;a href="http://delicious.com/"&gt;delicious.com&lt;/a&gt;), the application shows how easy it is to get started developing on the &lt;a href="http://dev.day.com/microsling/content/blogs/cup.c.html"&gt;CRX/Apache Sling bundle&lt;/a&gt;.  Russell is a self proclaimed novice programmer with skills mainly in HTML and Javascript.  To quote:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;â€œI was surprised how easy it was to get started with JCR, even for a new programmer like me. I know a little bit of Java, but I mainly write Javascript. So I was really, really happy when I saw how much you can do with JCR and Sling just using HTML and Javascript.  Basically, if you can write an HTML form, you can create a useful JCR app, because Sling takes care of a lot of server-side stuff and you really don't need to write Java Server Pages unless you want to. This is a great convenience and makes it possible for programmers of all skill levels to be productive right away with JCR. You don't have to be a Java expert at all."&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content>

    <title>Struggling publishers continuing their investments in digital</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://www.paidcontent.org/entry/419-ziff-davis-to-close-pcmag-print-focus-on-online-still-looking-for-optio/"&gt;The venerable PCMag is discontinuing its print edition&lt;/a&gt; - the most recent in a long string of similar announcements from other publishers.  I am seeing a consistent trend in my media and publishing client base.  While their overall businesses are struggling, they realize that they cannot afford to stop investing in online publishing.  Instead, they are cutting back in their editorial departments and even discontinuing their print editions in order to sustain their online investment (which accounts for an increasing percentage of their revenue as advertising dollars move online).  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has been going on for a long time.  Early in 2008, there was &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/26/us/politics/26bus.html?_r=2&amp;oref=slogin"&gt;an article in the New York times that said that newspapers are reducing their traveling campaign coverage&lt;/a&gt;.  Paper magazines have steadily been shrinking or disappearing entirely from news stand shelves.  Still online investment appears to be steady.  In fact, one of my clients recently sent out a letter to creditors excusing delayed payments because of a cash flow problem and they still have the go ahead for a new WCMS deployment.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an interesting time to be in digital publishing as companies are investing to squeeze as much revenue as possible out of their digital channels.  Some companies are being deliberate and methodical in their digital strategy.  Others are aggressively (and desperately) experimenting with lots of ideas hoping one will turn out to be a winner.  One thing I am not seeing is digital strategies that look beyond banner advertising sales.  Today's strategies are still focused on driving traffic and seeking the best &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPM"&gt;CPM&lt;/a&gt;s.  I am a little concerned about the future viability of traditional banner advertising as content becomes increasingly consumed on alternative (banner unfriendly) platforms and "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banner_blindness"&gt;banner blindness&lt;/a&gt;" spreads to the larger online audience.  However, I do think that until that new content business model emerges, the best thing an online publisher can do is continue to invest in creating a great digital product that attracts a loyal audience.</content>

    <title>Cloud Blues</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I have a site that was affected by the recent &lt;a href="http://thenextweb.com/insider/2012/06/30/amazon-web-services-outage-causes-netflix-instagram-heroku-and-more-to-grind-to-a-halt/"&gt;AWS outage that took out Netflix, Instagram, and Pinterest on Friday&lt;/a&gt;.  I thought I was in the clear when I checked on Friday. But I when I checked again on Sunday evening, my site was down.  The problem was that the database didn't come back correctly.  Last night I went through the restore procedure and the restore tool has been stuck in process all night.  After buying a support contract, I learned that it hangs when the backup is corrupt.  All of the support documentation says to just wait it out.  I am still working with support to get a good backup.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is very frustrating. The only comfort is that sites much bigger and more important than mine have also been taken down. The news about those big sites makes it easier to explain the issue to my users.  It definitely beats having to say that I did something stupid.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>CM Professionals Gets Two New Board Members</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cmprofessionals.org"&gt;CM Professionals&lt;/a&gt; recently held elections to replace two outgoing members of the Board of Directors (Ann Rockley and Frank Gilbane).  The two new board members are Scott Abel and Mary Laplante.  Both Scott and Mary have a long history of contributing to CM Professionals and I am looking forward to working with them as board members.  I also want to recognize Ann and Frank for their great leadership and dedictation to the organization.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CM Professional's management committee also got some new blood in this year's election.  &lt;a href="http://janusboye.dk/index.en.htm"&gt;Janus Boye&lt;/a&gt; is our new Director of Member Relations and &lt;a href=""&gt;Mollye Barrett&lt;/a&gt; is the new Director of Communications.  Welcome Janus and Mollye!&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>The CMS Myth on the value of drop-in labs</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cmsmyth.com/index.php/2009/10/the-value-of-drop-in-labs/"&gt;The CMS Myth presents nice strategy for training CMS users: drop-in labs&lt;/a&gt;.  The idea is similar to a college professor's "office hours" where the professor schedules time in his office to field questions from students.  In this case, it is a computer lab that an expert on the system staffs on a pre-set schedule.  Like office hours, this is a complement, not a substitute, to traditional classroom training.  A contributor attends a class, goes through classroom exercises there, and then comes back later to practice what he learns on his own work.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;This seems like an effective strategy for large CMS rollouts where it is impractical to distribute expertly trained power users across the office.   Small companies could benefit as well. I can see an advantage of allowing users to learn from each other as they passively listen to the instructor solving their co-workers problem as they do they their own work in the drop-in lab.  As any CMS user knows, each piece of content has its own little nuances and there are so many different ways to use a CMS.  Working with an expert nearby shortens period of learning the most effective strategies for achieving the desired result.  For example, "should I associate this image directly with this asset or put the image in a central image library and then reference it?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back in my in-house I.T. days, we used to make a point of "walking the halls" answering questions for weeks after a big system rollout.  Drop-in labs seem much more efficient but you don't get quite the same amount exercise.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Some news from the Bricolage camp</title>
    <content type='html'>The &lt;a href="http://www.bricolage.cc"&gt;Bricolage&lt;/a&gt; list has been quite active recently with announcements of new sites and a good discussion about integrating Bricolage into a dynamic presentation tier.  You should definitely check out the recently re-launched &lt;a href="http://www.sportsnet.ca/"&gt;SportsNet CA&lt;/a&gt;.  The home page is very dynamic with lots of multi-media and rapidly changing content like sports scores.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was also an anouncement of a Bricolage community newsletter called &lt;a href="http://bricolage.cc/news/2007/10/29/"&gt;Output Channel&lt;/a&gt;.  Pretty good for a project that was left for dead by &lt;a href="http://www.nautis.com/2007/08/17/cms-review-bricolage/"&gt;one reviewer&lt;/a&gt;.</content>

    <title>CMS and Compliance Systems</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;There was an interesting thread on the &lt;a href="http://www.cmprofessionals.org"&gt;CM Professionals&lt;/a&gt; mail list about the applicability of OS CMS for Policy and Procedures manuals. Apparently, this is an important enough issue that there is a group within CM Pros that wants to create an interest group on "Compliance Systems."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While much of the discussion was about special requirements that a P&amp;amp;P system has (access control, auditing content history, and who has read what) there was also disagreement over whether open source could be the platform for or could deliver such a system.  The initial argument against was that this use of a CMS was so specialized it was doubtful that there would be enough interest within the OS community to support it.  I find that hard to believe since the existence of the thread and the proposal for setting up an interest group is evidence of a common need.  Also, the same argument could be made to disbelieve the existence of commercial products in this space - just substitute the word "market" for "community".  That argument died out pretty quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second argument, which is even more interesting, is that you want to buy a commercial product so you have someone to sue if something goes wrong (such as a bug, I guess).  This was made by the representative of a vendor.  I wonder if the insurance companies know that their coverage is considered a primary benefit of their customers' product.  There has been a lot of talk about lawsuits as a risk of using open source software: such as getting wrapped up in the SCO lawsuit.  Some software companies offer indemnification for licensing violations.  Now it seems we are jumping the legal shark by naming lawsuits as feature.  I guess this means that the concern about support for open source (the old FUD factor) is dying down.  &lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Monitoring your hot standby</title>
    <content type='html'>As I mentioned in "&lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2012/12/marketing-i-t-in-the-cloud.html"&gt;Marketing I.T. in the Cloud&lt;/a&gt;," we maintain a hot-standby infrastructure on another hosting service. We automatically refresh this standby setup at a regular interval so that, if something really bad happened to our primary infrastructure, we could just re-point our domains and relatively recent versions of our sites would be back up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because this backup infrastructure is so critical, we monitor it just like our production infrastructure. One thing we have not been able to automate, however, is the check to make sure the front page is loading properly. The problem is that Wordpress forces a redirect to a primary host name. That is, if you try to hit the IP address of the backup server, it will redirect to the primary domain of the site (like &lt;a href="http://www.globalmarketingops.com"&gt;http://www.globalmarketingops.com&lt;/a&gt;) which is still running on the primary servers. The fact that the redirect even happened told you Apache is running and Wordpress is able to read from the database. But you wouldn't know if the pages were broken. This is a little like driving around with a flat spare tire. You know you have it but you don't know it is useless until you try to use it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our work-around has been to manually edit our hosts file (which overrides the DNS) and browse the site on a regular basis. But that is a drag. I couldn't find a ping service that allowed me to override the public DNS with temporary mappings. So I came up with something much simpler.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I edited the /etc/hosts file of the backup server to map the supported domains to itself (localhost). With that setting in place, we can run a script on the backup server that loads the home page of each of the sites and verifies that each homepage contains certain text. The script sends out a pass or fail notification. If the server was too broken to run the script we would not get the pass notifications and other alerts would sound. If we get a fail notification, we know that we need to fix the backup site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a pretty common challenge so I hope others can benefit from this simple solution.</content>

    <title>JSR 170 Approved</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I was catching up on my &lt;a href="http://www.gilbane.com"&gt;Gilbane&lt;/a&gt; reading and noticed an announcement that &lt;a href="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=170"&gt;JSR 170&lt;/a&gt;, the specification for the Java Content Repository (JCR), has finally been approved.  Thanks and congratulations to &lt;a href="http://www.day.com"&gt;Day Software's&lt;/a&gt; David Nuescheler and the &lt;a href="http://incubator.apache.org/jackrabbit/"&gt;Apache Jackrabbit&lt;/a&gt; Team for pushing the JCR through this arduous process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This news could not come at a better time for CMS owners and buyers who must be concerned with this &lt;a href="http://gilbane.com/blog/archives/2005/06/ecm_acquisition_1.html"&gt;latest round of M &amp;amp; A.&lt;/a&gt;  The JCR will allow organizations to store their content in a standards compliant repository that will enable greater flexibility in the tools they use to manage their content.  Now all we have to do is wait for a critical mass of CMS providers to support the JCR.  The open source world is clearly in the lead with Apache JackRabbit, the JCR reference implementation and several open source CMS are using it.  Day Software has a &lt;a href="http://www.day.com/content/en/product/jsr_170/content_repository.html"&gt;JSR 170 compliant JCR&lt;/a&gt; in Beta.  Expect &lt;a href="http://www.ibm.com"&gt;IBM&lt;/a&gt; to be the next company to release a commmercial JCR.  Oracle appears to be dragging their feet and blew an opportunity to integrate JCR support into their new ECM product or their database.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>The End of the Technical Résumé</title>
    <content type='html'>Having been employed at startups and fast growing companies, I have seen my share of technical résumés and my conclusion is that the technical résumé is nothing more than a misleading garble of acronym soup. They are totally worthless. Developers list every technology they have ever heard of regardless of whether they understood the technology or are current on it. Many developers work on large systems and have very little understanding of the technology beyond a narrow little slice that they were responsible for. Don't even get my started on certifications. In fact, my experience is that the more certifications, the less competent the developer. The technical résumé is the equivalent of search engine optimization circa 1999 - load your résumé with keywords, post it on &lt;a href="http://www.monster.com"&gt;Monster&lt;/a&gt;, and wait for the hits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The truth is that a developer is not good just because she knows a certain syntax or has worked with a product. What makes a good developer is how she thinks and how she works on a team. Good developers are interested in the underlying design and function of the technology and are diligent about following best practices - not because they are told to but because they understand the value behind them. Even when they are heads down, they are aware of what other people are working on. They anticipate interdependence and communicate. Good developers make other people on the team better.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Luckily, with the advent of social networking and Google, the era of the technical résumé is about to end - certainly for senior technical people and upcoming tech rock stars. The reason is that these people who are smart and love their field do not just code anonymously in their cube. They interact out in the open and with some good Google searching, you can follow their tracks. This is certainly the case for open source developers but it also holds true with developers that specialize in proprietary applications as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you are evaluating a technical candidate, don't spend too much time on the résumé. Start by Googling their name. There you will find posts to mailing lists and forums, chats on IRC, a blog, comments on other people's blogs, entries in bug tracking systems, even user group presentations that the candidate did. Ideally, you see the candidate answering a question or putting forth a well supported opinion. If he is asking a question, you can learn a lot from the quality of the information and the tone in the question. See &lt;a href="http://contenthere.blogspot.com/2007/02/how-to-post-on-open-source-mailing-list.html"&gt;my post&lt;/a&gt; on how to post on an open source mailing list for what makes a good question. Plus, a simple search may turn up any strange affiliations or interests that you might want to know about. For a proprietary product, you can do a lot by searching on the support extranet which may contain a forum or other community content space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.linkedin.com"&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt; and other social networking sites are a great resource. The candidate might have received recommendations from people he has worked with. You might even know someone in common. If you do, start talking to people and find out what they thought about working with the candidate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you are on the other side of the equation and you are a technologist that wants to optimize his employment opportunities, stop getting certifications. Get out there and engage. Rather than get an &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/mcp/mcsd/default.mspx"&gt;MCSD&lt;/a&gt;, show what you know by writing something helpful on a &lt;a href="http://forums.microsoft.com/msdn/default.aspx?siteid=1"&gt;MSDN Forum&lt;/a&gt;. Make more of an effort to understand the other components of the project you are working on. Sit in on someone else's code review. Actively read blogs (comment too). Participate in an open source project. If you are not interested enough to make this commitment, you can still have a comfortable career as a technologist but you will not go far. You will probably wind up being a PM ;)</content>

    <title>Open Source CMS Migration Tool</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;There is talk of new Open Source project to develop an application to migrate content from one CMS to another.  &lt;a href="http://snip.yukatan.fi/space/start/2005-02-21/1#CMS_migration_with_the_Exorcist"&gt;The Exorcist&lt;/a&gt; is for content what ETL (Extract, Translate, Load) tools are for data.  The design of the application uses custom import/export plugins that that are installed on the source and target repositories and translate content into an XML format that can be read, translated, and written by The Exorcist.  The application then does XML transformations from what the source plugin can write to what the target plugin can read.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At present, The Exorcist is still a concept which has been presented in blogs and at various conferences.  Initial development will be for the &lt;a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/"&gt;Midgard Framework&lt;/a&gt;.  As of this date, there is no project site for the project.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Daisy 2.1 Release is Official</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://outerthought.org/"&gt;Outerthought&lt;/a&gt; just &lt;a href="http://outerthought.org/site/news/news-2007-09-03.html"&gt;announced the official release of Daisy CMS: version 2.1&lt;/a&gt;.  For those who are not familiar with &lt;a href="http://cocoondev.org/daisy/index.html"&gt;Daisy&lt;/a&gt;, it is a fairly simple, easy to use Java based WCM platform.  The front end is styled after a wiki although it supports more comprehensive WCM functionality such as structured content types, decent access control, and workflow.  The repository is de-coupled and is accessible through a ReST style interface so the more ambitious or &lt;a href="http://cocoon.apache.org/"&gt;Cocoon&lt;/a&gt;-phobic (the user interface is written in Cocoon that has a steep learning curve) can write their own management interface and front end. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daisy is primarily used for basic informational sites, intranets, and knowledge bases.  Some companies use it to create documentation because of its XML  oriented architecture, its book publishing features, and also its powerful versioning and localization functionality.  Thanks to a partnership with the Belgian systems integrator &lt;a href="http://www.schaubroeck.be/"&gt;Schaubroeck&lt;/a&gt;, Daisy is widely used for local and regional Belgian government sites.  Daisy development is managed by Belgian systems integrator and software developer &lt;a href="http://outerthought.org"&gt;Outerthought&lt;/a&gt; which also sells support packages on the platform.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This new release is supposed to be easier to configure and manage (thanks to a new &lt;a href="http://www.springframework.org/"&gt;Spring&lt;/a&gt; based runtime container) and includes a very cool visual version diff'ing tool.  Unfortunately Daisy is still missing user input validation out of the box.  You can only set whether a field is required and the size of the input box.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have been looking for a basic, mature Java WCM and have been turned off by the complexity (in terms of user interface, architecture, and social dynamics of the community) of &lt;a href="http://lenya.apache.org"&gt;Apache Lenya&lt;/a&gt;, you should give Daisy a look.</content>

I never saw this coming! &lt;a href="http://sandro.groganz.com/"&gt;Sandro Groganz&lt;/a&gt; just pointed me to this blog post announcing that &lt;a href="http://blogs.mysql.com/kaj/2008/01/16/sun-acquires-mysql/"&gt;Sun Microsystems is acquiring MySQL&lt;/a&gt;. Kaj Arno (MySQL AB's VP of Community) does a pretty good job summarizing the implications of the the move. Much of the post centers on comforting MySQL users with assurances that Sun is a good company and will do right by the community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;What comes to my mind is that MySQL is seen as a leader in understanding and leveraging open source as a business model whereas Sun has seemed to be very muddled with their open source strategy. Maybe the MySQL team will give Sun some direction. I also wonder if Sun will draw MySQL away from its focus on the LAMP stack. S(olaris)AMJ(ava) doesn't sound as good to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I were a MySQL employee and was hoping for a big IPO, I would probably be a little disappointed as Sun's stock seems to be flat or working its way down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content>

    <title>Roy Fielding to CMIS: You don&amp;#39;t know REST</title>
    <content type='html'>Roy Fielding, &lt;a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm"&gt;creator of REST&lt;/a&gt; puts a &lt;a href="http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/no-rest-in-cmis"&gt;nice smack down on CMIS's claim of being RESTfull&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_Management_Interoperability_Services"&gt;CMIS&lt;/a&gt; was first announced, everyone looked at &lt;a href="http://www.day.com/site/en/index.html"&gt;Day Software&lt;/a&gt; whose CTO, David Nuescheler, was the main driver behind the Java Content Repository Standard (JSRs &lt;a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=170"&gt;170&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=283"&gt;283&lt;/a&gt;).   Of course, Day's response was gracious.  David write a &lt;a href="http://dev.day.com/microsling/content/blogs/main/cmis.html"&gt;congratulatory blog post&lt;/a&gt; and released this official quote:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"As three of the largest players in the ECM market, IBM, EMC and Microsoft are well qualified to initiate a protocol specification for content management interoperability that is complementary to a programming API like JCR," said David Nuescheler, CTO of Day Software. "Day Software is happy to actively contribute to the specification, which we view as a validation of our standardization and infrastructure efforts over the last three years. CMIS mirrors JSR 170 in that it is platform-agnostic, appealing to a mixture of languages and technologies. We congratulate the group and look very much forward to participating by contributing our JCR and REST knowledge and experience to future versions of the specification. We welcome CMIS as a high-level content protocol that transcends any one programming language, and see it as a win for the entire industry."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Roy, whose role at Day is Chief Scientist, was less constrained by politeness.  Not only does he take CMIS to task for not living up to its RESTful claims, he also calls out the CMIS team for jumping the gun on calling it a "standard."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ouch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content>

    <title>Growing Importance of Citations in SEO</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.seomoz.org/blog/prediction-anchor-text-is-dying-and-will-be-replaced-by-cocitation-whiteboard-friday"&gt;Here is a short and interesting video about the growing importance of citations to SEO&lt;/a&gt;.  It is cool to see how Google's relevance algorithms are getting more sophisticated at understanding the meaning in content and identifying authority.  Of course, the pessimist in me sees SEO bottom feeders interpreting this trend as justification for anti-social behavior like comment spam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe class="wistia_embed" name="wistia_embed" src="http://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/bi2l3muiwb?version=v1&amp;videoWidth=600&amp;videoHeight=338&amp;playerColor=565f66&amp;canonicalUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.seomoz.org%2Fblog%2Fprediction-anchor-text-is-dying-and-will-be-replaced-by-cocitation-whiteboard-friday&amp;canonicalTitle=Prediction%3A%20Anchor%20Text%20is%20Weakening...And%20May%20Be%20Replaced%20by%20Co-Occurrence-%20Whiteboard%20Friday%20%7C%20SEOmoz&amp;plugin%5Bsocialbar-v1%5D%5Bversion%5D=v1&amp;plugin%5Bsocialbar-v1%5D%5Bbuttons%5D=embed-videoStats&amp;plugin%5Bsocialbar-v1%5D%5Blogo%5D=true&amp;plugin%5Bsocialbar-v1%5D%5BtweetText%5D=&amp;plugin%5Bsocialbar-v1%5D%5BbadgeUrl%5D=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.seomoz.org&amp;plugin%5Bsocialbar-v1%5D%5BbadgeImage%5D=http%3A%2F%2Fembed.wistia.com%2Fdeliveries%2F436f1a1e1d6736dfffdb6b0ac829f0d879325434.jpg%3Fimage_resize%3D100" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" width="480" height="297"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the arms race between Google and the people who try to manipulate it, always side with Google.

    <title>Localizing the Long Tail</title>
    <content type='html'>Choosing the first few markets to localize your website for is relatively easy: look for the ones with the most obvious market potential. A U.S.-based company may start with U.S. Spanish and Canadian French and then expand into some of the larger European and Asian markets. A company that has some history as a global business, may already have a physical presence in those high-potential markets. Subsequent waves of expansion, however, create some trickier choices. Should your next market be Poland or Brazil? Maybe the Korea holds the most promise. The thing is that you just don't know true market potential until you try and it may take a while to realize whatever potential exists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At &lt;a title="Lionbridge Global Marketing Operations" href="http://www.globalmarketingops.com/"&gt;Lionbridge&lt;/a&gt;, we recommend &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2012/09/prioritizing-your-markets-with-tiers.html"&gt;grouping your markets into three tiers:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;Tier 1: Highest Revenue&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;Tier 2: Fastest Growing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;Tier 3: Everyone Else&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tier 3 represents the greatest strategic challenge. You want to have a &lt;strong&gt;good quality&lt;/strong&gt; presence in &lt;strong&gt;as many markets as possible&lt;/strong&gt;. After all, outside of your home market, every market starts out as a Tier 3. If you enter a market, you need to do it right with an effort that is worthy of your brand. You also need to commit to maintaining that site into the future, otherwise you will fall into the "time capsule syndrome" where your local market sites look like they were frozen in time ages ago. But you have limited resources and you don't want to divert spending away from markets where you are succeeding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To get into as many markets as possible without breaking the bank, you need to manage your localized sites extremely efficiently. The best way to meet that challenge is to use a translation proxy in a pattern that I call &lt;em&gt;"International Mini-Site."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you use a translation proxy, untranslated content is going to show through in the source language. In an earlier post (&lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2013/02/preventing-source-language-bleed-through.html"&gt;Preventing Source Language Bleed-Through&lt;/a&gt;), I talked about preventing this from happening. But that assumes that you want to pay to translate everything into all of your languages — and your Tier 3 sites may not justify that expense (not yet, at least).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The international mini-site pattern is like the "&lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2013/02/preventing-source-language-bleed-through.html"&gt;international snapshot&lt;/a&gt;" pattern but, instead of translating the full site, you proxy a much smaller site that is designed to have just enough information to get traffic and build business. Brevity, efficiency, and quality are key themes here. The international site should be cleanly branded (adjusted for culture, of course), search engine optimized, and ruthlessly edited to remove content that has organically grown over the years on your main site. If your main site (with all of its press releases, careers section, case studies, etc.) is 1,000 pages, your international site could be as little as five pages. Just explain what business you are in, describe your products, and direct customers where to buy. I often see this pattern in conjunction with using a platform like Marketo for marketing campaign landing pages (which can also be translated with a proxy).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once you have your international mini-site, you can easily manage your translation spend. You can make choices about whether to make a global edit that you will have to translate into all languages, or do some locale specific rewording to improve search result placement in a local market search. Most importantly, you can manage your Tier 1 and Tier 2 sites without worrying about the cost implications of having to translate new content into all of your Tier 3 languages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just because the international site is small, it doesn't mean it is not important and you don't have to manage it. On the contrary, you need to pay as much or more attention to it. Because you have less content to work with, every word needs to count. This is where many companies go wrong. They treat their international sites as redheaded stepchildren rather than strategic assets with potential to uncover new growth opportunities.  By staying small, you can be more agile and responsive.  You can focus more on each page to optimize the impression it gives.  You might even find that your main sites would be better served by a major Spring Cleaning.</content>

    <title>What your intranet needs is a publisher!</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;div style="float: right; margin-left: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;a title="photo sharing" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ontologicaldoubt/2448919635/"&gt;&lt;img style="border: solid 2px #000000;" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3199/2448919635_29a28b8d2e_m.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 0.9em; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ontologicaldoubt/2448919635/"&gt;J. Jonah Jameson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Originally uploaded by &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/people/ontologicaldoubt/"&gt;OntologicalDoubt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While I work with companies from many different industries, most of my clients media and publishing companies.  I like working with publishers for many reasons — not the least of which is the fact that this is an industry in transition and it is exciting to see my clients innovating and re-inventing themselves.  But the main reason publishers are so interesting to work with is that they, more than any other industry, understand the value of content.  It is their business. While you could make the argument that a publisher's key asset is its audience (not the content), it is the content that attracts the audience.  Publishers push their organizations to produce content that an audience wants to read and then look for ways to monetize that audience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Compare that with other types of companies.  How many marketing organizations think of their website copy as only a modest improvement over the Latin text that the web designer left behind?  Internal content is worse.  Updating the intranet is the last priority for the average knowledge worker.  People have more gratifying responsibilities than contributing to a web site that nobody wants to read.  In most companies, employees are not recognized for their intranet contributions.  Take, for example, a knowledge base.  If you have a brilliant piece of information, depending on where you work, it may be better to share it with individuals you know and have them "owe you" than to leave it to rot a in a place where nobody will benefit from it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Companies fool themselves when they think that if the tool makes contributing easy, staff will all of the sudden think contributing content is their number one priority.  You might get a slight uptick of activity when you deploy a new publishing system, but after the novelty wears off, people will go back to their old habits.  Writing content is hard work no matter how "fun" the tool is to use.  Employees will gravitate to work that is either easier to do or more rewarding (that is, things that are measured by their bosses).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Assuming that enterprise content has value and is worth managing, there needs to be someone in the organization responsible for maintaining that value.  Enterprise content needs someone to represent the audience and ensure that they are being served.  &lt;em&gt;Enterprise content needs a publisher.&lt;/em&gt; Pardon the geeky comic book reference but think of Peter Parker's (aka Spiderman) obnoxious boss J. Jonah Jameson (pictured above).  He relentlessly pushes his staff to create content that he knows &lt;em&gt;his readers want to read&lt;/em&gt;.  Granted, nobody wants to work for a jerk like that.  But is it any better to work for someone who doesn't care about what you produce?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the media and publishing world, &lt;a href="http://www.shirky.com/weblog/2009/03/newspapers-and-thinking-the-unthinkable/"&gt;Clay Shirky theorizes that the role of the publisher is becoming unnecessary&lt;/a&gt;.  The Internet has solved the journalist's problem of reaching an audience.  But that assumes that the journalist wants to become his own publisher.  The blogging phenomenon has seen just that.  Bloggers (citizen journalists) put up their own websites and invest large amounts of time building and cultivating their audiences.  They look at traffic stats; they think about wording for SEO and click through; they tag; they obsess over establishing their personal brand.  They didn't do this just because the blogging tools were easy to use.  The first generation of blogging tools stunk.  But the first generation of bloggers really wanted to publish and they were just happy for the opportunity.  Inconveniences and poor usability were not going to hold them back from having their voices on the Web.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many Enterprise 2.0 advocates predicted the same thing would happen inside the firewall; that employees would self publish with the same zeal on the Intranet as they did on their personal blogs if they had similar tools available to them.  It didn't happen — not because they couldn't figure out the tools but because they were too smart about managing their time.  They knew that they would gain more during their 9-5 work day from doing other things.  They satisfied their inner publisher during nights and weekends at home where they could reach a much larger audience and &lt;em&gt;own their content.&lt;/em&gt; If they could get away with it, they would sneak in a post to their personal blog from their cube.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is only so much you can do to motivate your employees to "want" to publish on your Intranet.  You can make it part of their job description; you can recognize their efforts.  But you will probably not be able to create the hunger for attention within your firewall that will unleash that entrepreneurial publisher spirit.  If they have that spirit within them, it will be expressed on their personal blogs.  To get your employees to act like journalists, you need a J. Jonah Jameson type.  Maybe not as abrasive, but just as passionate.  Have your internal publisher imagine that he is in a circulation war with a competing intranet and that he should do whatever it takes to capture and enthrall subscribers.  Just tell him to 86 the cigar; he will never get that approved by HR.</content>

    <title>Does the average user prefer multi-factor authentication to expiring passwords?</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I was doing some anecdotal research about password security preferences and I was surprised to find that most of the people I talked to favored two-factor authentication (using Google Authenticator) over expiring passwords.  My survey pool consisted of project managers who I think are pretty typical enterprise software users.  Around half of them had not seen two-factor authentication until I showed it to them.  The general attitude was that anything is better than expiring passwords &amp;mdash; an opinion that I agree with.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are my colleagues unusually geeky or is this a trend that other people are seeing as well?  If you have experience, research, or intuition around this, I would love to hear from you.  @reply me on Twitter: &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sggottlieb"&gt;@sggottlieb&lt;/a&gt; if you have something to say.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Acquia at Drupalcon</title>
    <content type='html'>I attended the &lt;a href="http://acquia.com/"&gt;Acquia&lt;/a&gt; panel at &lt;a href="http://boston2008.drupalcon.org/"&gt;Drupalcon&lt;/a&gt; in Boston yesterday.  I must admit that I thought this session was going to be packed with people interested in what Acquia is going to do and how it will relate to &lt;a href="http://drupal.org/"&gt;Drupal&lt;/a&gt;.  Plus, &lt;a href="http://buytaert.net/"&gt;Dries&lt;/a&gt; always draws a crowd.  It turned out that &lt;a href="http://boston2008.drupalcon.org/session/whats-theme-power-enterprise-level-theming"&gt;the session on theming&lt;/a&gt; drew a much bigger crowd.  In hindsight, I am not surprised.  I was sitting in the Drupal IRC channel when the Acquia announcement first hit.  There was a mention of the news but neither concern nor intrigue about this new addition to the Drupal family.  People were more focused with the their immediate tasks working with Drupal.  They trust Dries and the &lt;a href="http://association.drupal.org/"&gt;Drupal Association&lt;/a&gt; to do what is right for Drupal.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The session started out with an introduction to the Acquia team.  The first thing of note was the early hire of &lt;a href="http://hojtsy.hu/"&gt;GÃ¡bor Hojtsy&lt;/a&gt; whose primary responsibility was to get Drupal 6 released.  I think that this demonstrates Acquia's commitment to the Drupal community and how they can help themselves by helping Drupal.  Another significant hire was &lt;a href="http://jeffwhatcott.com/drupal/"&gt;Jeff Whatcott&lt;/a&gt; from Adobe for marketing.  Their community evangelist &lt;a href="http://association.drupal.org/blog/67"&gt;Kieran Lal&lt;/a&gt; was walking around in colonial period attire to signify being a founder although most mistook him for a pirate.  He should re-use the outfit on &lt;a href="http://www.talklikeapirate.com/"&gt;September 19th&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Acquia's business model hasn't changed since the original announcement.  They want to be the Red Hat or MySQL of Drupal and they want Drupal to be &lt;i&gt;the&lt;/i&gt; web application framework for Web 2+.  In the near term they are going to allow the community to shape their activity by taking a play from the &lt;a href="http://www.zimbra.com/"&gt;Zimbra&lt;/a&gt; book.  The &lt;a href="http://acquia.com/projects"&gt;Acquia Projects&lt;/a&gt; page will allow the community to suggest and vote for enhancements and services that they would like Acquia to provide.  Paid technical support is another core service that Acquia will sell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little furtherdown the road (2nd half of 2008), Acquia's strategy focuses around two offerings: Carbon (a supported Drupal distribution with certified modules) and Spokes (a collection of network based services like safe automated updates and configuration control).  There will be more value added software in the future.  The product names were inspired by CEO and co-founder &lt;a href="http://underheadphones.com"&gt;Jay Batson's&lt;/a&gt; (don't bother following the link.  Jay has been too busy to blog.  I know the feeling.) interest in cycling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the big contributions that Acquia hopes to provide is rigor around testing.  During Dries' keynote, he spoke about building in testing frameworks (unit, system, and integration testing) and it seems like Acquia has the experience and funding to make this contribution.  This strikes me as similar to &lt;a href="http://www.spikesource.com/"&gt;SpikeSource&lt;/a&gt; who also tried to create a commercially supported Drupal distribution.  I was going to ask what made SpikeSource's &lt;a href="http://www.spikesource.com/solutions/drupalcms.html"&gt;SpikeIgnited Drupal&lt;/a&gt; fail but the answer is obvious.  They didn't have Dries.  In fact, they didn't have any relationship with the Drupal community and the resulting product was pretty lame: Drupal without the modules.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another part of Acquia's strategy is establishing a network of certified partners that can work with Acquia to build and serve the market for Drupal.  They are going to do this through partnership and certification programs.  The latter will be run by trainer and &lt;a href="http://apress.com/book/view/1590595629"&gt;Drupal book&lt;/a&gt; author &lt;a href="http://robshouse.net/"&gt;Robert Douglass&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for Dries, the deal is that he gets a minimum of two days per week to spend on anything Drupal related be it coding, community development, or being a spokesman for the product.  He reiterated the point that he is able to make decisions that are better for Drupal than for Acquia.  Hopefully these two interests will not be in too much conflict.  I have not seen the agreement that was signed (nor do I expect to) so I don't know the wording of Dries's terms.  My major concern is that VCs (which gave $7mm to Acquia) like to have control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brings me to a bigger question about VCs: what did they buy?  It seems that much of the VC pitch centers around the growth and promise of the Drupal project.  VC's would love the fact that every time a new release of Drupal comes out, the number of downloads doubles.  But I hope that they understood that they did not buy Drupal itself.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As long as Dries is on board and Dries keeps his promise to the Drupal community, Acquia's success may mirror Drupal's. However, Acquia will probably not be able to monetize all of the Drupal phenomenon.  Figuring out a way to capture the upside of Drupal's success without having a negative relationship with Drupal will be Jay's job.  A commercial entity has the promise of helping the Drupal project by bringing in more interest and adoption for Drupal and also protecting the Drupal purists from the open source n00bs that are still running around looking for throats to choke.  Acquia's services will probably appeal to medium to larger sized companies that have money to spend on software.  Not the small, budget-less non-profits that bring a lot of the energy and passion into the community.  If Acquia can target new markets with their products and serve existing markets with their Drupal contributions, I think they can achieve a nice balance.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content>

    <title>Recovery.gov on Sharepoint now?</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Nadav Schreibman just commented on my post &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2009/10/is-drupal-the-right-platform-for-whitehouse-gov.html"&gt;"Is Drupal the right platform for whitehouse.gov?"&lt;/a&gt; to say that &lt;a href="http://ohmygov.com/blogs/general_news/archive/2009/10/23/Recovery-gov-revamped-with-an-unexpected-helper-SharePoint.aspx"&gt;Recovery.gov is now running on Sharepoint.&lt;/a&gt;  I was pretty shocked when I read the article and had to check the source on the site.  Sure enough, I am seeing Sharepoint HTML in all of its postback glory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The referenced article from &lt;a href="http://ohmygov.com"&gt;Oh My Gov&lt;/a&gt; talks about how the Recovery.gov needed a more portal-like framework.  Both &lt;a href="http://drupal.org"&gt;Drupal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://sharepoint.microsoft.com/Pages/Default.aspx"&gt;Sharepoint&lt;/a&gt; can be described as development frameworks.  Drupal leans more towards being a CMS product (with strong capabilities for developing content) while Sharepoint is more of a portal (with strong capabilities for pulling content and data from other sources). It seems like Recovery.gov, with it's mandate to expose where recovery money is being spent, needed more portal and less CMS.  This was an expensive change &amp;mdash; the redesign project cost $18 Million, which may not be a lot of money in government spending terms but is more than most of my clients have lying around.  Thanks Nadav for the tip! &lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Watch Out Webex</title>

At $0.33/minute/person for a pay per use session, the bill probably came to around $120 (without integrated voice).   That is actually more than the train ticket to get to New York where the client is.  Still, when you factor in the time (9 hours of travel round trip!), parking at train station, and (of course) the carbon, it was an economical choice.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An even more economical choice would have been to use &lt;a href="http://docs.google.com/"&gt;Google Doc's&lt;/a&gt; presentation feature for free.  It would have worked for me because I wasn't showing anything other than slides.  If I was demo-ing an application I would have needed to use WebEx or some other real screen sharing application.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh well.  Something to keep in mind for next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content>

    <title>Operationalizing Your Content Marketing</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ahaval"&gt;Ahava Leibtag (@ahaval)&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="http://www.ahamediagroup.com/"&gt;Aha Media Group&lt;/a&gt; and I recently finished a new white paper called &lt;a href="http://info.lionbridge.com/content-marketing-operations-ebook.html?utm_name=contentoperationsebook&amp;utm_source=contenthere&amp;utm_medium=blog"&gt;"Three First Steps to Operationalizing Your Content Marketing"&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the white paper we discuss the huge gap between strategy and execution.  While marketing organizations often think about strategy, business results are achieved through sustained execution &amp;mdash; not short term initiatives like task forces and website redesigns.  This goes back to a theme that I have been talking about for years: &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2010/06/jeff-cram-your-website-is-not-a-project.html"&gt;your website is not a project&lt;/a&gt;.  Back then I liked to talk about a website as a "product" that needs to be continually maintained and improved.  Given that product management is not a common strength in organizations (why can't more people just follow the "&lt;a href="http://www.codesimplicity.com/post/suck-less/"&gt;make it suck less&lt;/a&gt;" philosophy?), I have started to talk about the web and other forms of digital communications as a "program."  Still not great, but at least it sounds less cheesy than to say "it's a journey."  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No matter what you call it, it takes time and effort to build the trust and attention of an audience.  And the only way to do it cost-effectively is to be operationally efficient.  You need to be able to prioritize your goals and commit to a plan; then have the team to execute it. This white paper has three parts:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Obstacles that stand in the way of organizations establishing effective content marketing programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Getting started. How to identify audiences and develop a strategy to reach them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How to baseline where you are right now so you can measure the effectiveness of your activities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can get it here:  &lt;a href="http://info.lionbridge.com/content-marketing-operations-ebook.html?utm_name=contentoperationsebook&amp;utm_source=contenthere&amp;utm_medium=blog"&gt;Three First Steps For Operationalizing Your Content Marketing Strategy&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>Grading Your CMS Implementation (Voice Over Edition)</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I gave this talk at the &lt;a href="http://www.jboye.com/conferences/philadelphia11/"&gt;J. Boye Conference in Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt; last week (GREAT conference by the way. I already verbally committed for next year).  &lt;a href="http://jboye.com/conferences/philadelphia11/program/speakers/seth-gottlieb/#presentation"&gt;My slides are posted on the J. Boye site&lt;/a&gt; and you can also get them on &lt;a href="http://www.slideshare.net/sggottlieb/grading-your-cms-implementation"&gt;SlideShare&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One thing I tried to do with this presentation was to reduce the amount of the bullet points in my slides.  While I thought this made the presentation better, the slides are less useful for people who were not there (and also people who were there but missed or forgot the pearls of wisdom I was dropping down).  Because of that, I thought it would be a good idea to write a blog post with some of the slides and some key points that I talked about.  Here goes...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;It is more than just a software project&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sggottlieb/5700350601/" title="grading_cms_slides_jboye_2011.003 by sggottlieb, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5187/5700350601_01944a81ef.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="grading_cms_slides_jboye_2011.003"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is extremely rare that an organization just installs and configures a CMS.  A CMS project is nearly always in the context of a much larger initiative that might involve:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A site redesign&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        &lt;li&gt;Major IA rework&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        &lt;li&gt;New visitor facing functionality&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        &lt;li&gt;Organizational change&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;So it is really a mistake to think of it and evaluate it as just a software project.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;It is a roller coaster&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sggottlieb/5700924834/" title="grading_cms_slides_jboye_2011.005 by sggottlieb, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5107/5700924834_a9d92e4b98.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="grading_cms_slides_jboye_2011.005"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every project goes through this roller coaster.  The business case and software sales process raise expectations by talking about the potential of the solution &amp;mdash; long term potential.  Launching a new CMS is a tough transition.  It doesn't feel anything like the rosy future you were promised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a time when you are supporting two sites: you need to keep the wheels on the old site as you migrate content onto the new site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The new tools are unfamiliar to content contributors.  They don't know the short cuts and work-arounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The content you are moving is not as good as you thought so there is unplanned work to improve it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is organizational pressure to show results for all the money spent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You were probably thinking that you were crossing the finish line but now you realize that the real work is starting and it is going to be a real slog. &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is going to be a dip.  It is just a matter of amplitude: how high did you let your expectations get and how much pain did you go through around launch time.  A great project may not dip below neutral satisfaction but I have never seen a project easily achieve the loftiest of hopes for it &amp;mdash; at least not on day-one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The components of your grade&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sggottlieb/5700354369/" title="grading_cms_slides_jboye_2011.007 by sggottlieb, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5145/5700354369_17afacc0ee.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="grading_cms_slides_jboye_2011.007"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grading a CMS implementation is matter of measuring the dip and we do this in three dimensions: Vision, Execution, and Platform.  Vision is what you are doing and why.  Execution is your action against that vision.  Platform is the tools that you build on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How the components fit together&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sggottlieb/5700355809/" title="grading_cms_slides_jboye_2011.008 by sggottlieb, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3240/5700355809_b0a5d97000.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="grading_cms_slides_jboye_2011.008"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another way to look at it is you have vision driving execution which then produces results that inform vision.  This cycle is supported by a technology platform.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Setting your goals&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sggottlieb/5700928816/" title="grading_cms_slides_jboye_2011.009 by sggottlieb, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2333/5700928816_d8173decaf.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="grading_cms_slides_jboye_2011.009"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;You should have defined, communicated and aligned behind goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Every stakeholder should be able to give an elevator pitch stating the goals, why they are important, and their role in helping to achieve those goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Goals should be related with organizational goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Goals should be measurable.  At any point in time you should be able to tell if you are getting closer to your goals or moving away from them&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Your content strategy&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sggottlieb/5700929152/" title="grading_cms_slides_jboye_2011.011 by sggottlieb, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2574/5700929152_5f8907b2e3.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="grading_cms_slides_jboye_2011.011"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I didn't go into content strategy too much here because that is a huge topic on its own.  I merely introduced what I call the first principles of content strategy.  If you have a good handle on audience, information, and behavior, you are probably on the right track to a good content strategy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Setting expectations&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sggottlieb/5700929394/" title="grading_cms_slides_jboye_2011.012 by sggottlieb, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5222/5700929394_5ba102e984.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="grading_cms_slides_jboye_2011.012"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A shovel doesn’t magically produce a hole.  A new shovel will be most appreciated by someone who has been desperately scratching at the earth with a stick or his bare hands. Digging is hard work.  A shovel makes the effort more productive.  Similarly,  content production and management is hard work.  It's hard to learn and serve your audience.  A CMS is like a hand-tool.  The right tool will make a dedicated team more effective.  If you thought you were getting out of hard work, your expectations were probably unrealistic.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Platform vs. Execution&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sggottlieb/5700357459/" title="grading_cms_slides_jboye_2011.013 by sggottlieb, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3013/5700357459_cf5bee1736.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="grading_cms_slides_jboye_2011.013"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Platform and execution are often difficult to pull apart. The platforms are so configurable that it is not easy to tell if an issue is intrinsic to the platform or if it was self-inflicted by the execution.  Different elements tend to gravitate toward one side or the other but there is a big grey area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Training&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sggottlieb/5700930152/" title="grading_cms_slides_jboye_2011.014 by sggottlieb, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3092/5700930152_3b228331fc.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="grading_cms_slides_jboye_2011.014"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Training is the single most important component of any content management initiative.  If your training program is successful, your users will know their roles and have the skills to perform them.  They will be able to achieve their goals no matter what obstacles are thrown in front of them.  Unfortunately, training is an afterthought in most content management initiatives and is funded by budgetary scraps left over from earlier phases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You need to think about training 4 stakeholder groups: contributors who add content and participate in workflows; developers who support and enhance the solution; administrators who keep it running; and visitors who consume content.  I got a little push back here by people who took the last group literally.  I don't mean dragging all the site visitors into a classroom.  My point here was that when you make major changes to your website, you need to think about how to help your visitors through the transition.  Don't believe me? Remember the Facebook, Digg, and Gawker redesigns and all the agida they produced?  Visitor training strategies may include redirects so the old URLs work, search functionality that maps old terms to new terms, and instructional text.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Training programs are most effective when you:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Incorporate classroom and practical elements&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Time classroom training so it happens right before trainees need to do the work &amp;mdash; so they don't forget what they learned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Closely monitor and support users as they are starting to work on the new platform. This is when habits are formed (the good ones and the bad ones too). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Content Modeling&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sggottlieb/5700358345/" title="grading_cms_slides_jboye_2011.015 by sggottlieb, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2800/5700358345_c2e260a4a9.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="grading_cms_slides_jboye_2011.015"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Content modeling is important because it determines how content is stored and managed in the system.  This has implications in how content is authored and, more importantly, what you can do with the content.  More structure means better reusability but it also makes the content contributor more dependent on the template developer to control what the visitor sees.  You need a balance.  In order to achieve that balance, your content contributors need to buy into the notion of separating content from layout and you also need to give them formatting tools where they need them.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an example of unstructured content.  The editor used styling to give the impression of structure.  The CMS would have a hard time doing things like creating a summary of this content on an index page or optimizing this page for a mobile device.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After beating this example up, I will defend it by saying that in this case a wiki was the right tool because the organization didn't have access to presentation template developers, had plenty of content editors, didn't have a lot of content, and needed to be nimble.  A wiki is not a bad platform for Wikipedia either.  So the amount of structure really depends.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Worlkflow&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sggottlieb/5700358597/" title="grading_cms_slides_jboye_2011.016 by sggottlieb, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5266/5700358597_dc4199b5dc.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="grading_cms_slides_jboye_2011.016"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here I gave my &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2011/05/workflow-is-it-a-factory-or-is-it-congress.html"&gt;Manufacturing/Legislation metaphors&lt;/a&gt; of workflow.  If you want to increase efficiency with workflow you need to have specialists at the ready to help &lt;em&gt;produce&lt;/em&gt; content.  Workflows dominated by approval steps publishing down.  Don't aspire to the assembly line but create Congress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Presentation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sggottlieb/5700358805/" title="grading_cms_slides_jboye_2011.018 by sggottlieb, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5108/5700358805_5f1691e7a2.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="grading_cms_slides_jboye_2011.018"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the technical effort of a CMS implementation is usually in developing presentation templates.  This is where all of your display logic is.  Any visitor-facing behavior is also coded in presentation templates.  There are two ways to fail here.  Inefficient code that does not use caching effectively or has sub-optimal content queries will cause your site to become unstable when under load.  Sloppy, repetitive coding will be a long term maintenance nightmare. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Instrumentation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sggottlieb/5700358977/" title="grading_cms_slides_jboye_2011.019 by sggottlieb, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3537/5700358977_deacea6c76.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="grading_cms_slides_jboye_2011.019"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instrumentation is more than just tracking hits and unique visitors.  Those metrics can be useful for signaling major issues and trends but you really need to be tracking data that will tell whether your strategy is working or not.  This gets back to my point that content strategy is based on Audience, Information, and Behaviors.  Instrument your site to tell you whether or not your information is driving the right behaviors from your audience.  Collecting the right data will help you refine your vision and strategy so you can iterate toward long term potential that your business case promised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of the session, I handed out this &lt;a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/54963380/CMS-Implementation-Worksheet"&gt;Content Management Assessment worksheet&lt;/a&gt;.  I encourage you all to think about a CMS implementation you were involved with and grade it.  How did you do?

    <title>How I Talked Myself Out of a Kindle</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;It takes me a really long time to buy a gadget.  Over the course of months I deliberate whether I really need the device and, if I do, what options I should get.  The current object of my rumination is the &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00154JDAI?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=contenthere-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00154JDAI"&gt;Amazon Kindle 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=contenthere-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00154JDAI" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /&gt;&lt;br/&gt; and, right now, the pendulum is on the "not buy" side of the swing.  Here are the arguments that are keeping it there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I like to share books with my friends and family.&lt;/strong&gt;  The exchange of books can be a nice social experience. You loan or borrow a book and you have at least one person you can discuss it with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I buy used books.&lt;/strong&gt;  Used books can be a great deal.  I like to browse used book stores and tags sales to find  interesting books at a reasonable prices.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The paper book just may be the culmination of reading technology.&lt;/strong&gt;  More durable than a papyrus scroll, cheaper than liquid crystal, what could be better than paper?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My personal library is a carbon sink.&lt;/strong&gt; You see an overloaded book case, I see hundreds of pounds of carbon &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; released into the atmosphere.  A Kindle would be powered by a coal plant on the other side of town.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I would rather read than talk about my reading device.&lt;/strong&gt;  I have hardly ever seen anyone actually reading a Kindle.  Most Kindle owners that I see are too busy getting interrupted by strangers who have an opinion about the future of eBooks.  A shy person like myself appreciates the camouflaging qualities of a nice boring looking paper book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;There you have it; those are my reasons.  They are working for me right now but, in case you are not convinced, you can click through this &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00154JDAI?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=contenthere-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00154JDAI"&gt;Amazon Associates link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=contenthere-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00154JDAI" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /&gt;&lt;br/&gt; and put a little money in my Kindle fund (because that I know that I will eventually cave).&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Ostatic Interview of Angela Byron</title>
    <content type='html'>In case you missed it, &lt;a href="http://ostatic.com/users/samdean"&gt;OStatic's Sam Dean&lt;/a&gt; has an &lt;a href="http://ostatic.com/176988-blog/interview-angela-byron-top-drupal-developer-and-evangelist"&gt;excellent interview with Angela Byron&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;a href="http://drupal.org"&gt;Drupal&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;a href="http://www.webchick.net"&gt;Angela&lt;/a&gt; works for &lt;a href="http://www.lullabot.com/"&gt;Lullabot&lt;/a&gt; and is an important contributor in the Drupal community.  She contributed to the upcoming O'Reilly book &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596515804?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=contenthere-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0596515804"&gt;Using Drupal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=contenthere-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0596515804" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best quote:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The Drupal project has an unconventional philosophy on backwards compatibility. During each major version of Drupal, developers are highly encouraged to think up crazy new things that Drupal can do, without fear of breaking legacy APIs. While users' data will always be preserved throughout the ages, if we come up with new standards we want to support, or a much better and more performant way of doing something, developers are given free reign to go off in that direction.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content>

    <title>Never Underestimate the Importance of Training</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Never underestimate the importance of training your users on a new CMS.  Even if &lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;you&lt;/span&gt; consider the new tool easier to use, it may be disorienting to someone that has built their work habits around another technology.  To illustrate the point....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;object width="425" height="350"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/eRjVeRbhtRU"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/eRjVeRbhtRU" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;</content>

    <title>What the Customer Really Needed</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.projectcartoon.com/cartoon/2"&gt;This great cartoon showing how a product is understood and described by different stakeholders&lt;/a&gt; is definitely going in my toolbox for explaining project disfunction.  My explanation will be that you can't start to achieve a common understanding of something until get visual.  If everyone got together and drew a picture of the solution and then regularly checked in as it was incrementally built, the potential for miscommunication would be nearly zero.  &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2007/03/poc-prototype-or-pilot-when-and-why.html"&gt;Proofs of concept, prototypes, and pilots are useful for communicating more complex functionality&lt;/a&gt; &amp;mdash; Much better than a lengthy detailed written specification.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>The End of Print Media</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://gizmodo.com/5013835/ballmer-predicts-death-of-printed-media"&gt;Steve Ballmer predicts the end of printed media in 10 years&lt;/a&gt;.  "there will be no media consumption left in 10 years that is not delivered over an IP network."  I guess you wind up saying things like that when you force yourself to repeat "I will not underestimate the Internet" 100 times a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this is true, I wonder if that will lead to better (portable and stationary) electronic displays or a huge jump in the home printer business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the content production side, I wonder if content will still initially  be produced for a print format (creating print-ready PDF using InDesign/K4) or in more presentation neutral contribution environment (like classic the web content management model).</content>

    <title>Matt Raible and LinkedIn</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://raibledesigns.com"&gt;Matt Raible&lt;/a&gt; has an &lt;a href="http://raibledesigns.com/rd/entry/the_linkedin_journey_continues"&gt;interesting post about some framework evaluation work&lt;/a&gt; that he did for &lt;a href="http://www.linkedin.com/"&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;.  During the project, Matt helped LinkedIn address the issues of framework proliferation and the maintenance of a proprietary framework.  &lt;a href="http://www.springframework.org/"&gt;Spring MVC&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://struts.apache.org/2.x/"&gt;Struts2&lt;/a&gt; were considered but neither of them solved the problem of a long development/deployment cycle: it takes a lot of time to change and run code.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is also nice mention of &lt;a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/"&gt;Rails&lt;/a&gt; vs. &lt;a href="http://grails.codehaus.org/"&gt;Grails&lt;/a&gt;.  But the biggest news was buried in the middle of the post.  Matt is joining LinkedIn as a full time employee.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;A few days later, I was pulled into the CTO's office and he offered me the job. He offered me the challenge of building this team and told me I could do it remotely (from Denver) and hire my own people to help me with it. I gulped as I realized I'd just been offered the opportunity of a lifetime.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Matt is going to head up the UI Frameworks team and he is &lt;a href="http://www.linkedin.com/jobs?viewJob=&amp;jobId=483817&amp;fromSearch=39&amp;sik=1204111006804"&gt;hiring&lt;/a&gt;.</content>

    <title>Time Machine Restore</title>
    <content type='html'>Although few people do it, restoring from backup is the only way to ensure that your backup and recovery system works.  Since upgrading to Leopard, I have been using Time Machine to back up my laptop over the network (onto a and external hard drive connected via USB to my &lt;a href="http://store.apple.com/us/product/MB053LL/A?fnode=home/shop_mac/mac_accessories/airport_wireless&amp;mco=MTA4NDM2"&gt;Airport Extreme&lt;/a&gt;).  What better way to test a restore from Time Machine than to put in a bigger hard drive and restore?  I figured if it didn't work, I would still have my old hard drive (still working but too small).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy to report that the restore went perfectly.  The general instructions are to be found &lt;a href="http://duncandavidson.com/2008/01/restoring-from-time-machine.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  The only difference is that I restored from the network rather than directly through the USB port.  The one little hitch I ran into was that it took a couple of times for the utility to see my new local hard drive.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am the kind of person who is frequently shocked when things work as advertised so I was in awe that, after I swapped out the hard drive and ran through the process, it was like nothing happened but the free space of my hard drive grew.  All the software was as I left it.  Even my BASH history was intact.  The only thing missing was my "Downloads" - I had to recreate it.  I guess this is because Mac regards this as a temporary space and not worth recovering.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, don't hesitate to set up Time Machine.  It could help you recover from a massive hard drive failure, a stolen laptop, or any other disaster - as if it never happened.</content>

    <content type='html'>[...] Will your average marketing group be able to leverage this functionality? Or will it be yet another unused feature that clutters the user interface? My hope is that once contributors and site managers start to experiment and see results, they will rapidly evolve to be more committed and proactive in the same way social media participants started to embrace tagging when they saw their work start to surface in more prominent places. A tight and accurate feedback loop is important in any learning process so maybe access to testing and metrics has been the missing feature rather than usability-oriented functionality like in-context editing. It is probably more effective to make a task interesting and rewarding than to make that uninteresting work easier to do. The former strategy will cause a user to overcome any obstacle he is faced with. In the latter strategy, there will always be some excuse not to do the work. I touched on this idea in an earlier post called “What your intranet needs is a publisher!” [...]</content>

    <title>Levels of Localization</title>
    <content type='html'>Frequently the terms "Internationalization" or "Localization" (abbreviated to "I18N" and "L10N") are found on requirements or Requests for Proposal documents.  While companies typically are under-prepared to fully support a localized website, it is good that they thinking ahead to when they are ready to reach out to these different markets.  Unfortunately, too often I hear localization talked about in binary terms.  As in, "does this product support localization?"  Or "Should we localize this site?"  In reality it is not black and white - just many gradations of gray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Faced with the similar problem of in determining whether a web site is "accessible," the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), came up with a three tiered structure of priorities that range from "must" have to "may" have.  This allows people to qualify just &lt;i&gt;how&lt;/i&gt; accessible a site claims to be.  There are many similarities between accessibility and localization.  After all, when we talk about localization, aren't we really talking about accessibility for people with different languages and customs?  In both cases:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;We are trying to reach out to an audience that is presently not able to access the content.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is a cost-benefit trade-off as to how far we go to serve these audiences.  Hopefully, this will not create a big ethical debate but it all depends on your audience and what their capabilities and sensitivities are.  Note: if your website works well with a screen reader, it will also work well with a search engine spider.  So you don't have to care about social responsibility to care about accessibility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You might be mandated to serve a certain audience.  In the U.S., there is Rehabilitation Act Section 508.  In the Canadian government, publications must be in English and French.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surprisingly, there are no guidelines or evaluation criteria for localization.  Not until now...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later this month at the CM Professionals Summit, I am going to hold a round table to get feedback on these Levels of Localization.  If the session is productive and we reach alignment, the working group will propose this to be a CM Professionals endorsed set of guidelines on localization.  To get more feedback, I am going to post some initial ideas here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before I go too much further, it will be useful to define what I mean by localization.  Localization means supporting specific alternative locales (geographic regions distinguished by language, government, and custom).  Localization can be (and frequently is) part of an Internationalization strategy of reaching broader audiences and interacting in a &lt;i&gt;global&lt;/i&gt; marketplace ("Globalization" is usually used to describe an economic process of regional economies merging into a global economy).  Factors that go into the localization process include:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Text (including text on images) translated into local language and dialect&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prices and other money references converted into local currency&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Formats (such as date and time) displayed according to local conventions&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Weights and measures converted into locally accepted units&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Culturally appropriate imagery and colors&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not all websites and content are worth going to all that trouble for.  Here are some intermediate steps that might serve the goal of increasing accessibility to new user groups but fall short of the true definition of localization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Level 1.&lt;/b&gt;  This level assumes that the audience is proficient enough in the site's primary language to be able to navigate a site and find what they need.  However, the specific assets that they seek are critical enough or the detail is important enough that they would feel more comfortable accessing them in their local language.  Sites that reach this level have the following characteristics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Selective translation.&lt;/i&gt;  While all of the main site components (navigation, header, footer, etc.) and the bulk of the content are uni-lingual, certain important assets are translated into alternative languages.  Typical examples of selectively translated content include product manuals and downloadable forms.  A news agency might have a feed of news that is written in or translated into a localized language.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Transactive accessibility.&lt;/i&gt;  Pages that require user input should be usable by the target locale.  For example: different phone number and "postal code" formats, neutral designation for address fields (province vs state), and (possibly), double byte characters.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Level 2.&lt;/b&gt; This level is achieved when the user is able to select a language and whole site (including navigation and buttons) is presented in the selected language.  All that is available in the primary language should be available on the localized languages.  However, in cases where content is not translated, there should be a fall-back mechanism that notifies the user that the asset is not available in his selected language and provides access to the primary language version.  There are many subtle nuances with this behavior that should be fully specified and understood.  For example, when the site falls back to the primary language of an asset, does the whole site switch over as if the user selected another language?  Or does the body of the primary language content appear within the selected locale's navigation?  When a user selects another language, does the site refresh to the home page or to the localized version of the content currently being viewed? How divergent are different localizations of a site allowed to become?  When a new  version of one translation is published (or reverted), what happens to the other translations of that same content asset?  Are they un-published until they are updated to reflect the new version of the primary translation?  Is anyone warned?  Or are they left up there with the potential of being out of sync?  Level 2 localization is usually supported on a single site instance by the CMS's internationalization functionality that maintains relationships between different translations of content, remembers the users locale selection, and provides a translation framework for static text within presentation templates (for example, the word that says "search" on the search box).  Usually the CMS's localization framework will have specific philosophies on these nuances so it is important to understand how localization is implemented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Level 3.&lt;/b&gt;  The highest level of localization has all of the characteristics of the localization definition described earlier in this article.  This level requires a balance of power and control between local management (that knows the local audience) and corporate headquarters (that understands the global strategy and vision of the company).  Sometimes it is difficult to tell the difference between full localization and a chaotic collection of renegade foreign offices.  If the appropriate balance is achieved, local audiences receive information that the international company wants to communicate but delivered in a way that the local branch wants to express it.  Out of balance, different audiences will receive intentionally or unintentionally conflicting information.  Achieving this level of localization is largely a governance problem.  Local variances need to be explained to and approved by headquarters in a business process that does not unduly obstruct the local divisions need to conduct business.  There needs to be a communication mechanism so that global and specific changes desired by corporate are communicated to and executed by the localized sites.  These same forces complicate many other aspects of managing multi-national companies.  Sometimes it is hard to shield customers from these dynamics.  I am still waiting to see a perfect example of a single instance of a CMS supporting this complex network of control.  In general, local business units require a certain degree of inde&lt;br/&gt;pendence and agility that is difficult to achieve on a single, centrally managed platform.  However, there are things to look for in a CMS that will help matters:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;A solid notification system.&lt;/b&gt;  When something changes the appropriate people need to be notified of the nature and impact of the change.  This could be workflow based email notifications to external users.  It could be cross-system workflow where the primary system initiates a task on a secondary system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;A localization aware reporting system.&lt;/b&gt;  In order to achieve adequate governance, it is necessary to understand how content is being translated and syndicated to localized sites.  There should be some way for the system to know if a newly published content asset has been localized.  This could be achieved by a post-publish workflow state.  Web log analytics are useful here too.  It is important to know of broken links coming from localized sites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;A replicatable platform.&lt;/b&gt;  While it is unrealistic (and frequently undesirable) to require every local business unit to use the same CMS, synergies may be achieved if a corporate standard were made available for localized sites.  Presentation templates can be re-used and customized for a local market, users required to work on multiple systems will have less technology to learn, and it may be easier to orchestrate cross-system workflow (on the last point, lock-in risk might be mitigated by integrating with a third party workflow engine).  More importantly, the software acquisition costs should make it affordable to distribute the tools.  This also holds for the case of when a local site manager needs to log into the primary CMS to access pre-published content.  These occasional users need accounts and it should not be cost prohibitive to provide them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, these Levels of Localization will introduce some much needed terminology to the discussion of an important topic that companies are increasingly considering in their CMS implementations.  I am sure that a continued dialog will refine these ideas and drive toward a new standard that helps companies understand their real localization needs and be able to communicate them in the specification of a CMS.  If you find this concept interesting, please send feedback.  Or, better yet, join me at the &lt;a href="http://www.cmprofessionals.org/events/summit/fall2006/program/"&gt;CM Professionals Summit!&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>James Robertson: Taking a business-centric approach to portals</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;James Robertson of &lt;a href="http://www.steptwo.com.au"&gt;Step Two Designs&lt;/a&gt; recently published an &lt;a href="http://www.steptwo.com.au/papers/kmc_businessportals/index.html"&gt;excellent article&lt;/a&gt; on portals.  As usual, James has a very pragmatic and even perspective in evaluating the business value of the technology.  In addition to helping to define the term "portal" (I would say that over half of the projects that I have worked on that were initially described as portals were actually not portals at all.), the article reminds us that portal integration is only one click deep and is not a silver bullet to the enterprise information problem.  But, if executed properly, there is business value in having a central place that summarizes information managed in different places.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One peculiarity that I did notice, was that Jame's definition of customization and personalization are the reverse of what I am used to hearing.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Personalisation allows individual users to tailor the portal for themselves (such as what information is displayed).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Customisation involves the filtering of information and tools to target identified user groups or roles (such as delivering information to specific geographic areas).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Must be a hemisphere thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>To Tell or Not to Tell?</title>
    <content type='html'>One of the main services that I provide my clients is help with software selection.  Usually the first piece of work is to clarify requirements and establish a short list of software to consider.  Then I am often asked to manage the selection process.  In this role I have two goals: to help all the products make the best impression possible (when they look good, I look good for bringing them in), and to make the choice easy for my client.  I do the latter by helping each supplier present to their strengths.  When different products have different strengths (and they always do) the demonstrations help the client identify which of their requirements are the most important and what compromises are acceptable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the selection process, each vendor frequently asks in direct and indirect ways who they are up against.  I understand why they want to know.  I have been in their shoes and I know it is nice to know "the enemy" and where your relative strengths and weaknesses are.  They also want to know if they have a chance and how they should price.  However, I tend not to provide that information and this is why...  I want each vendor to focus on the client and what they bring to solve the client's problems.  I don't want them to worry about the strengths of their opponent because that leads to two behaviors.  First, it causes them to try to exploit a weakness of the other products by drawing attention to features or characteristics that the other products lack (whether they are relevant or not).  Second, it causes them to try to disguise their weaknesses by downplaying the importance of a feature or pretending their capability is actually better than it is.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The net result is that every vendor's pitch turns into something like "we are just as good as they are but better."  To the client, the products start looking the same and, as I mentioned earlier, that is not what I want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would love to hear other people's thoughts on this.  Please discuss...</content>

    <title>The Dark Ages of the Future</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;There is a mini-meme going around about the fragility information in a digital society. The argument goes that, because we manage information in proprietary digital formats and rapidly changing devices, we are increasing the risk of losing everything.  Archeologists of the future will not be able to analyze MS Word 2010 files on old hard drives like the archeologists of today can read ancient texts on papyrus and stone.  One of the better posts is &lt;a href="http://opensource.com/life/10/10/information-overload-dark-ages-20"&gt;Cheryl McKinnon's OpenSource.com article "From information overload to Dark Ages 2.0?"&lt;/a&gt;  and the video embedded below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;iframe title="YouTube video player" class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="560" height="345" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/PSlMzirvsFc?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowFullScreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I call this a mini-meme because it is not stirring up a Y2K-bug-grade hysteria.  I guess you need images of planes falling out of the sky to get that level of reaction.  The concern for this is more in line with that of the constant low level anxiety that all CIOs feel from the information overload problem &amp;mdash; "this is a big problem that we are going fix after we take care of all the urgent matters on our plate."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We do need to curate and preserve information that is important.  We need to do it on an individual level so our descendants can know where they came from and we need to do it on a societal level to teach future civilizations what we know.  The problem is that we have a lot of crap to sift through.  It used to be that producing information assets was hard and expensive.  If you got an idea to create something, you would consider the effort and cost it would take to produce and distribute it, and then weigh that against the value.  If something was created, you could assume that someone thought it was important.  Now... not so much (queue the LOLCats).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In ancient times you had to have near-deity status for someone to go through the trouble of carving your likeness in stone.  The cost of portraiture has been steadily going down to the point where now people don't even know when their picture is being taken.  Remember, not long ago (before digital photography became the norm), you would really hesitated before snapping the shutter because each picture would cost you regardless of whether it even came out or not?  When I got my first digital camera, I would snap away but delete the photos off the card to save space.  Now I don't even bother to delete the bad ones.  You can even go onto Facebook and see that a grainy blur has been tagged as you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same thing happens in the office.  When I came of age professionally, one of my first responsibilities was to produce and distribute a productivity report.  This meant running the report, printing it, making copies, and then putting them in physical mail boxes.  It took the better part of a morning to do it.  If there was even an outside chance that report wasn't useful, that task would disappear.  Ten years earlier, I would have had to type up the report and run it through a mimeograph.  It would have taken more than a day and wouldn't have been worth it.  Now email inboxes are flooded with automatically generated reports that nobody reads.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will be difficult to go through all the digital information we are producing and decide what is worthy of preserving for the long term.  We will probably procrastinate this effort until there is some sort of scarcity or scare that brings the threat of loss to the forefront.  When we do get around to it, however, I think we are going to learn about ourselves in the process. &lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type='html'>Thanks for the comment!  The wp-config conditionals approach is an interesting idea.  My only concern is with storing production database connection information in a Git repository that I tend share with lots of developers.  In Django, I tend to use environment variables like:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;dj_database_url.config(default=os.environ.get(&amp;#39;OD_DATABASE_CONFIG&amp;#39;,&lt;br&gt;                                                                     &amp;#39;postgres://p3:p3@127.0.01:5432/p3&amp;#39;))&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That way, you need access to the server to know that information.</content>

    <title>Control vs. Delegation</title>
    <content type='html'>A couple of months ago, I fell in love with the Platform as a Service (PaaS) Heroku for a new web application that we are building. Compared to managing a farm of EC2 instances and other Amazon Web Services (AWS) products, Heroku seemed like a dream. Set up is ridiculously easy and a simple Git push command deploys your application. You don't need to think through things like failover and escalation procedures. It is just supposed to work. Then I read this article about &lt;a href="http://rapgenius.com/James-somers-herokus-ugly-secret-lyrics"&gt;Heroku on the Rap Genius blog&lt;/a&gt; and all of the sudden the dream started to sound too good to be true. This article on The Virtualization Practice nicely summarizes the different perspectives between &lt;a href="http://www.virtualizationpractice.com/who-is-responsible-for-paas-cloud-application-performance-21213/"&gt;Rap Genius, Heroku, and New Relic&lt;/a&gt;. To summarize even further, Heroku and New Relic were not transparent about the performance of the entire system and this prevented Rap Genius from being able to cost-effectively scale their application.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In my case, I stuck with Heroku for a while and may have continued with it but I ran into an issue where I could not easily install a Python library and that hassle, combined with the seeds of doubt already sowed, sent me back to hosting directly on AWS. I still think that Heroku offers tremendous practicality and value to many different types of applications. But like with any choice, there are trade-offs. The big one with a PaaS like Heroku seems to be Control vs. Delegation. You can't really have both. If you want complete control over something, there is no way to avoid responsibility for it. With Heroku, if there is an incident or the site is slow, I would just have to say "Heroku is having a bad day," and get on with my own good day. I wouldn't be frantically trying to resolve the problem because my lack of control would render me powerless. Of course, that wouldn't protect me from blame. Blame would be applied retroactively for making the decision to host on Heroku in the first place (back when I had control).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With AWS, I have a little more control. I can design an architecture that spans different availability zones and regions. I can even &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2012/12/marketing-i-t-in-the-cloud.html"&gt;create a mirror site on another hosting provider&lt;/a&gt;. But that means more effort and money. If I wanted even more control, I could host the sites on our own servers in some colocation facility. But every step towards full control doesn't necessarily reduce risk. It just shifts it. When I have more control, the sources of risk are my own failures in design and planning. And in my case, I just don't trust my knowledge of network and server administration to be better than the specialists. Like with any decision, you need to find a balance: you need enough control to fulfill your responsibilities but not so much that you exceed your capability to handle it.</content>

    <title>Another use for RSS</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;A little while back, &lt;a href="http://www.globelogger.com/moonwatcher/"&gt;Charlie Wood&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.globelogger.com/item.php?id=521"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; about using RSS as a mechanism for Lightweight Enterprise Application Integration (EAI).  The general idea is that if you need to synchronize data between two applications, you might be able to do it by having each application listen to the other's RSS feed.  I like the simplicity of this idea and the fact that it is able to leverage something that many systems are already building in.  However, since this is using a "pull" technology it will not support real-time synchronization unless there is some way for the source system to notify the target system to re-check the RSS feed. Otherwise the target system would have to check the source system at fairly frequent intervals.  Still, for occasionally updated data (such content in a CMS), it seems very workable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Something to think about before investing in a heavy messaging architecture.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>PL Upload: a solution for uploading really large files into a web
application.</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I am working on this web application project that has a requirement for users to upload REALLY big files (as in 1 gigabyte plus).  Given ubiquitous broadband (do people even call it broadband anymore?), and increased usage of video, I would not be surprised if lots of developers are seeing this requirement.  The problem is that the basic HTML file upload field is horrible for very large files.  It does not resume if there is a momentary interruption in transfer and the server gets stuck with one very large, resource-eating request.  The traditional work-around is to use a flash application to upload the files. &lt;a href="https://code.google.com/p/swfupload/"&gt;SWFUpload&lt;/a&gt; seems to be the most common implementation, but if you go to the home page, you will find that the project is no longer being maintained and is starting to break with new versions of Flash.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was feeling pretty discouraged until I discovered &lt;a href="http://www.plupload.com/"&gt;PL Upload by Moxiecode&lt;/a&gt;.  If Moxiecode sounds familiar, it is because they make &lt;a href="http://www.tinymce.com/"&gt;TinyMCE&lt;/a&gt;, which has practically turned into the de facto standard rich text editor (WYSIWYG) for applications like content management systems.  Sorry &lt;a href="http://ckeditor.com/"&gt;CK Editor&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best part of PL Upload is that it embeds multiple implementations and selects the right one based on the capabilities of the browser.  Modern browsers get an HTML5 implementation.  There are also Flash, Silverlight, Google Gears options.  You set the order of options to try and some Javascript goes through your list until it finds one that works.  Another really nice feature is that PL Upload chunks the data into bite size morsels so that your server-side code gets lots of small requests rather than one big one.  This makes resource management much easier and prevents one large upload from compromising the overall performance of the site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think the Moxiecode team is brilliant for seeing this problem and building such a nice solution.  They seem to have used the same logic as when they came up with TinyMCE.  Take a pervasive, nagging problem and build a clean solution that can become a de-facto standard.  Their business model is to dual-license the software: &lt;a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html"&gt;GPLv2&lt;/a&gt; for websites like mine and a commercial license for embedding the component in non-GPL software applications. I expect to see PL Upload surfacing in lots of content management systems just like I see TinyMCE.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Content Management Overview</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;On the last day of the &lt;a href="http://www.gilbane.com/CM_conference_Boston_04.html"&gt;Gilbane conference&lt;/a&gt;, Erik Hartman demonstrated his new site &lt;a href="http://tools.hartman-communicatie.nl"&gt;Content Management Overview&lt;/a&gt;.  The initiative is based on &lt;a href="http://www.cmsml.org/"&gt;CMSML&lt;/a&gt; and has information on 92 content management systems.  The site will allow vendors to submit information about their product (moderated by Erik's team) and is designed to be used to narrow down the field of products considered in a CMS selection.  I think the tool has the potential to be very useful, especially if the vendors and OS projects participate and there is reason to believe they will. Erik said that he frequently is asked by vendors why their product is not included.  He showed an email from a Vignette executive as example.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During his presentation, preceding Erik's, Bob Doyle handed over the management of the CMSML repository over to Erik.  &lt;a href="http://www.cms-review.com"&gt;CMS Review&lt;/a&gt; will continue to support the CMS comparison tool using data from Hartman's site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would encourage people to use the Content Management Overview site.  If you disagree with any product claims, you can add comments directly on the site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content>

    <title>Plone &amp;quot;Distros&amp;quot;</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plone4artists.org/"&gt;Plone4Artists&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.cmswatch.com/Trends/585-Content-and-technology-standards-in-New-Zealand"&gt;New Zealand's "Government Web Guidelines compliant Content Management System"&lt;/a&gt; are two examples of a group with specific needs putting together a "stack" of Plone technologies, with some customizations and making it available to a wider community. This is similar to the concept of &lt;a href="http://distrowatch.com/"&gt;"Distros" in Linux&lt;/a&gt;, which have been very effective in spreading the use of Linux. If this turns into a powerful trend, success will depend on the degree to which the Plone distros keep in sync with the core Plone community. Failure to do so may lead to fragmentation and compatibility issues.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Serena finally has a plan for Collage</title>
    <content type='html'>Over the past year I have been wondering about &lt;a href="http://www.serena.com/"&gt;Serena Software's&lt;/a&gt; plans for their &lt;a href="http://www.serena.com/products/collage/"&gt;Collage product&lt;/a&gt;.  If you haven't seen Collage, it is a simple but useful WCM system that is relatively widely used in higher education.  Serena has been steadily marginalizing the product for a while.  It has gotten so bad that the only way I can find Collage on the Serena website is to do a search for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, the &lt;a href="http://www.duoconsulting.com/blog"&gt;Duo Consulting blog&lt;/a&gt; has a scoop that &lt;a href="http://www.duoconsulting.com/blog/index.cfm?mode=entry&amp;entry=A51CC373-1143-5828-E26AAEE2AE8AD542"&gt;Serena's plans to sell Collage.&lt;/a&gt;  Content management historians know that Serena acquired Collage when it bought Merant software whose primarily line of business was configuration management (source control) software (PVCS).  Serena may not have even wanted Collage but it came in the deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't know what the acquisition market is for a middle of the road WCM product (especially with today's credit crisis) but I have a feeling that some company will come along and pick it up.  In the meantime, Serena will continue to do the bare minimum to keep the product alive.</content>

    <title>Is this CMS worth the money?</title>
    <content type='html'>During any CMS selection, it is fairly common to look at software products that span a wide range of prices — everywhere from free to several hundred of thousand dollars in up front licensing.  Buyers invariably get confused as they consider vastly different pricing models and try to put those numbers in context of the whole project costs.  They struggle to force different products into an "apples to apples" comparison.  And, all the while, they are told by the vendors that each solution is the really the &lt;em&gt;cheapest in the long run&lt;/em&gt; (bring on the tired &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2008/12/interwovens-foss-fud.html"&gt;free puppy analogies&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Content management software feels worse in this regard than other types of software selections.  For one, there is no clear market leader in content management software.  This means there is no single company to create a "gold standard" for feature/function/price.  Secondly, it is not the case that the large vendors are more stable or offer more features than the mid-market and open source providers.  In fact, it has been quite the opposite.  The household brand names like Interwoven, Vignette, RedDot have all been in pre-acquisition balance-sheet-beautification mode over the past few years.  In other words, they have been minimizing engineering investment and milking their customer base for revenue.  Even during the Web 2.0 boom, what little engineering money was spent didn't make its way to web content management.  With all of the high profile corporate acquisitions of Interwoven, Vignette, and RedDot, high end buyers didn't get the stability they were looking for either.  So, the old adage "you get what you pay for" didn't hold up for the high end web content management marketplace.  The middle tier of commercial software vendors have been delivering better products with less risk than the upper tier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"You get what you pay for" didn't really hold up on the free end of the spectrum either.  There are many examples of successful implementations built on top of open source software.  These solutions were not entirely free.  They cost money to implement and customize and many customers purchase support and maintenance but, then again, all content management software (commercial or open source) requires customization and integration work and maintenance can be 20% of licensing cost.  My experience is that open source solutions are generally no harder or time consuming to implement than commercial software solutions (and I have implemented plenty of both).  The way to reduce the cost of the entire solution is to minimize your customization/integration work by choosing a platform (commercial or open source) that best matches your requirements.   It just may be that the closest match is open source.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When talking my clients through a selection, I am often put on the spot with a question like "what additional features do you get when you go with the more expensive products?"  A similar question is "what will we get if we spend more?"  These are hard questions to answer because there is no single feature that only appears in higher end products.  Usually the best I can do counter with an analogous question "is a Porsche Cayman worth the $23,000 extra in price over a Subaru Impreza WRX?[&lt;a href="#note1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;]" Both have 265HP engines.  Both have many of the same features (radio, air conditioning, speedometer, tachometer, airbags...) but they are very different cars.  Obviously some people think the Porsche is worth the extra money.  But I can't tell you whether it will be &lt;em&gt;worth it to you because it is a personal feel thing&lt;/em&gt;.  You get in the car and it feels right.  You might even find that you like the less expensive car better because of the arrangement of the controls is more intuitive or the shape of the seats fits your back better.  Of course, if you don't have $55,000 for a car, you can save yourself time by not looking at Porsches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Open source software can be the same way.  You might find a particular product whose feature list is very similar to a commercial application you are considering; it has versioning, workflow, a powerful content modeling framework, in-context editing, image manipulation, etc.  But these features may have been implemented in a slightly different way — not better or worse, just different; and not because of the licensing model but because two different engineering teams implemented the features.  I can't predict which alternative will feel right to the prospective user base.  They need to experience the products to make the comparison.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of my selection process is to present products that match my client's stated requirements.  To use that car analogy a little more, the cars with the right size engine, the right number of seats, and below a certain price.  I also look at industry filters like what is happening with the vendor (I have not recommended Vignette, Interwoven, or RedDot over the last three years because it was pretty obvious the direction they were going).  Then I provide some exercises to help the client "test drive" each short listed solution and experience its characteristics and feel.  We still do have discussions like "is this CMS worth the extra $100,000?" but only after the client gets a true feel for the differences in the products (and the vendors behind them) and maps these differences to the needs of the organization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a name="note1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I dislike car analogies but nobody seems to know very much about bicycles.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</content>

    <title>Fatwire offer&amp;#39;s CS Express</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I just noticed this &lt;a href="http://www.cmswatch.com/News/Article/?363"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; on CMS watch.  What I find interesting is that when I used to work at divine (then purveyor of Content Server (CS) as well as a very capable lower market solution called Participant Server (PS)) the strategy was to sell CS as an industrial strenth enterprise class CMS, and PS as a solution to departments or small companies where CS was overkill.  Then corporate politics started to distort the strategy.  The sales organization came largely from Open Market (makers of CS) and the services organization came from ePrise (makers of PS).  Sales all but forgot about PS because they didn't know the product and the high license price of CS produced higher commissions.  Services didn't like CS as much because they found it harder to use making it difficult to deliver against the overblown expectations and underestimated services costs set by sales.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wonder if CS has gotten much easier to use in the last couple of years.  I remember seeing a &lt;a href="http://www.fatwire.com/news/pressrelease_10192004.html"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; announcing First Site which contains a bunch of starter templates and reusable components (kudos to FatWire for getting that done, I know that such a project was on the queue at divine for ages).  Also, I wonder if FatWire is experiencing organizational issues similar to divine.  FatWire had its own CMS which seems to have taken a second seat to CS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content>

    <title>Calendar Feature Request: Meeting Buffers</title>
    <content type='html'>A while back I wrote &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2008/10/business-time.html"&gt;a post about how I use Google Calendar sharing to help my clients schedule me for meetings.&lt;/a&gt; Recently, I have started to experiment with a service called &lt;a href="http://tungle.me"&gt;Tungle Me&lt;/a&gt; that essentially does the same thing but allows people to create meeting requests too.  Calendar sharing is a great help but something is missing and I am surprised nobody has done anything about it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a big difference between my meeting schedule and my availability.  You can't assume that my availability equals all the gaps between my meetings because often I need to travel to and from a meeting and that makes time when I am not available.  My hack-ish work-around is to schedule two overlapping meetings: one to block off my travel time, and another for the actual meeting.  My colleague who is viewing my free/busy time calendar sees the two meetings as one block of time when I am unavailable.  I guess instead I could create events for my travel time before and after.  Both options are clumsy but they work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I was thinking a really useful feature for a calendaring system would be to add a "buffer time" field when you mark an event to "show as busy."  Buffer time would simply the number of minutes (before and after) to expand the event on your free/busy calendar.  It could be a text input with a syntax of "30" (for adding 30 minutes before and after the event) or "30,15" (for 30 minutes before and 15 minutes after).  Buffer time could also be useful on your personal, full-calendar view because it would tell you when you need to leave for your meeting.  I imagine this may pose a problem for calendaring systems that share a single meeting object between all of the attendees because each attendee will have different buffer times.  But this is not a problem that some good data modeling can't solve.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hopefully the collaboration vendors will start to build this capability into their products soon.  In the meantime, does anyone have a better work around than what I have been doing?</content>

    <title>Now What 2013</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/blend-interactive/8662444635/" title="Now What? Conference by Blend Interactive, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8252/8662444635_9e0b103105.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="Now What? Conference"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week I had the honor of being the first speaker to present at the first &lt;a href="http://nowwhatconference.com/"&gt;Now What Conference&lt;/a&gt;.  My presentation was called "&lt;a href="http://www.slideshare.net/sggottlieb/now-what2013-public"&gt;Marketing Operations: How to get the bang from your bytes.&lt;/a&gt;" The conference was an amazing experience.  Here are a few reasons why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The production values were amazing.&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/karlasanti"&gt;Karla Santi&lt;/a&gt; and the rest of the Blend Creative Team obsessed over every detail from the stage lighting to the placards showing where to charge your laptop.  I have never presented at such a professional conference.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The audience was totally locked in to every presentation.&lt;/strong&gt; It may have been the topics, the format, or the fact that it was a one day conference.  Maybe the awful weather scared away the folks who were just looking for a cubicle break.  I am not sure how else to explain how engaged the audience was.  The lobby outside of the theater was barren during the sessions.  &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/blend-interactive/8663543270/in/set-72157633278810033"&gt;Everyone at the conference was in their seats and taking notes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The speakers were excellent&lt;/strong&gt;.  There was a perfect balance of inspirational big ideas and practical advice. The speakers drew from years of experience and came prepared to deliver thoughtful presentations.  The conference had one track and I felt like my experience as an audience member was better than I could achieve by making perfect selections at a multi-track conference.  Kudos to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/gadgetopia"&gt;Deane Barker&lt;/a&gt; for the speaker roster.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many thanks to Deane, Karla, and the rest of the &lt;a href="http://blendinteractive.com/"&gt;Blend Interactive&lt;/a&gt; team for putting on such an excellent conference.  The hard work really showed and I hope it was as rewarding for them as it was for us.  Hopefully there will be many more.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Licensing of Plone</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;There is a very interesting conversation happening in the Blogosphere about the conflicting  licensing terms of Zope and Plone.  &lt;a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0116506/"&gt;Paul Everitt&lt;/a&gt; does a very nice job of &lt;a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0116506/2005/11/21.html#a370"&gt;summarizing the issue in his blog.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The general gist is that Zope uses the &lt;a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/zpl.php"&gt;Zope Public License (ZPL)&lt;/a&gt; which is modeled after the Apache 1 license and is less restrictive than Plone's &lt;a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/gpl-license.php"&gt;GPL&lt;/a&gt; license.  Plone's use of a more restrictive license is thought by some to be uncooperative with the Zope community and confusing to users.  I think Paul raises an excellent point that Zope did the exact same thing by not adopting the &lt;a href="http://www.opensource.org"&gt;OSI Certified&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://python.org/2.3.2/license.html"&gt;Python license&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;a href="http://www.plope.com"&gt;Chris McDonough&lt;/a&gt;, in the comments of Paul's blog, raises a very good point that developers on the Plone platform tend to commit code to both Zope and Plone and having different licensing schemes makes things unnecessarily complicated.  I definitely hear that.  You don't want licensing terms to determine where your code belongs.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don't think that this problem is going to get solved but I don't think that it necessarily needs to.  Paul has a nice status quo solution:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Forget about product re-use. Instead, focus more on avoiding duplication of framework stuff. When somebody needs to do something, get them to do it at the right stack layer, under that layer's license. This is the goal of Goldegg. I think this is a more useful and realistic answer to code sharing in the stack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By "forget about product reuse" Paul means trying to do things like using a piece of Plone in another (possibly proprietary) product.   I think this solution makes sense and it is certainly more actionable than trying to get everyone to change their licensing schemes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>UNC Health Care Site Launces On Plone</title>
    <content type='html'>There is an &lt;a href="http://programming.newsforge.com/programming/05/05/04/218202.shtml?tid=48"&gt;article on News Forge&lt;/a&gt; about the &lt;a href="http://www.unchealthcare.org/"&gt;University of North Carolina School of Medicine&lt;/a&gt; re-launching their internal and external websites in Plone.  UNC Healthcare had the classic problem of organically grown websites creating a disjointed and confusing experience for their visitors.  Operating on a modest budget, UNC Healthcare discovered Plone and was able to achieve a true content management solution at minimal cost.  In addition to typical content management benefits of distributed authoring with centralized control,  UNC Healthcare developed and deployed a "Find a Doctor" application on the Zope framework.</content>

    <title>The Art of Community</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Not that long ago, I started reading &lt;a href="http://www.artofcommunityonline.org"&gt;The Art of Community&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;a href="http://www.jonobacon.org"&gt;Jono Bacon&lt;/a&gt; is posting to this blog as he writes an &lt;a href="http://www.oreilly.com/"&gt;O'Reilly&lt;/a&gt; book by the same name.  You can read drafts of the first chapters &lt;a href="http://www.artofcommunityonline.org/2009/01/22/first-snippet-from-the-book/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.artofcommunityonline.org/2009/01/28/second-snippet/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  I expect demand for this book to be high because communities are valuable but very difficult to create.  Companies often envy the passion and personal investment that some open source communities have been able to inspire and they get frustrated when their community building attempts fail to thrive.  Jono has been involved with &lt;a href="http://www.linux.org/"&gt;Linux&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.kde.org/"&gt;KDE&lt;/a&gt; and currently serves as the &lt;a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/"&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/a&gt; Community Manager for &lt;a href="http://www.canonical.com/"&gt;Canonical&lt;/a&gt; so he knows a thing or two about open source communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I have written on the topic of &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2006/12/evaluating-a-community.html"&gt;evaluating the health of a community&lt;/a&gt; and have been approached by more than one software company looking for that special sauce to help create a self-sustaining customer community.  One thing is for certain, communities are not built on tools - it takes more than a forum or a wiki to make a community.  Tools like these can help an existing community communicate better but they can't establish a community where there isn't one.    A successful community requires a &lt;strong&gt;purpose&lt;/strong&gt; worthy of passion (for a great discussion on this, see &lt;a href="http://theengagedconsumer.powered.com/2008/12/19/would-you-join-a-toothpaste-community/"&gt;"Would you Join a Toothpaste Community?"&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;strong&gt;leadership&lt;/strong&gt; to help people productively focus their passion, and methods for people to get &lt;strong&gt;value&lt;/strong&gt; out of their participation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So far, the best book that I have read about the community aspects of open source software has been &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0674018583?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=contenthere-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0674018583"&gt;The Success of Open Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=contenthere-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0674018583" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /&gt;.  The Art of Community will have a much greater focus on how to create a community.  The table of contents looks like a manual for a community builder.  One thing that I would like to see, but haven't yet, is a set of strategies for creating a passion-worthy purpose out of a seemingly mundane topic (like toothpaste).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of the writing process involves building a community of readers and harnessing their input.  The project is still too young to see if there is any traction.  I am looking forward to seeing how both the book and the community around it come together and if &lt;em&gt;purpose&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;leadership&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;value&lt;/em&gt; emerge.  &lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Excellent post on centralization vs. decentralization of IT</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;My colleague, Jeff Potts, just posted an excellent article on the tension between centralization and decentralization of I.T.  I have had these same ideas rolling around in my head for a while but could &lt;a href="http://contenthere.blogspot.com/2006/07/open-source-governance-within.html"&gt;not voice them as eloquently&lt;/a&gt; as Jeff did.  So in the spirit of reuse, &lt;a href="http://ecmarchitect.com/archives/2006/09/05/709"&gt;please read on&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Open Source CMS and Google Summer of Code</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;There are a number of major open source CMS projects that are participating in the &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/summerofcode.html"&gt;Google Summer of Code&lt;/a&gt; program.   For those of you who are out of the loop, Summer of Code is a program where software developers are given a project and are given a $4,500 reward if they satisfactorily complete the project on time.  Organizations can volunteer to be mentors which means that they assign a project and evaluate the results.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are the proposals from the open source CMS projects:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://wiki.apache.org/general/SummerOfCode2005"&gt;Apache Lenya&lt;/a&gt;:  Search enhancement, improving the integration with WYSIWYG editors, workflow engine improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bricolage.cc/dev/summer_of_code/"&gt;Bricolage&lt;/a&gt;:  Porting to Apache2/mod_perl2, porting to other databases (currently supports PostgreSQL only), improve WebDAV support, improve Subversion integration, improve the installation process (amen), site tagging and rollback, improve Unicode support, improve the bulk edit interface, bulk upload of media documents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://drupal.org/summer_of_code_2005"&gt;Drupal&lt;/a&gt;: Drupal automated test suite, Quiz module, workflow engine, social context of content, REST API implementation, AJAX (buzzzz), subscriptions for module core.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://news.mamboserver.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=799&amp;Itemid=67"&gt;Mambo&lt;/a&gt;: XHTML Compliance, virtual filesystem library, AJAX library, rich internet application for administration.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This looks like a great idea to get people involved with open source and a great way for Google to identify top technical talent.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>&amp;quot;ZOracle&amp;quot; Part I: The Problem</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.optaros.com"&gt;Optaros&lt;/a&gt; recently finished a project to build a prototype that adapted an elaborate &lt;a href="http://www.zope.org/Products/CMF/"&gt;Zope CMF&lt;/a&gt;-based custom CMS to persist content to an Oracle database rather than the ZODB.  The reason for doing this was that the ZODB was not performing adequately under the heavy load that the CMS was subject to and was not open to non-Zope technologies that our client wanted to share data with at the database layer.  The next set of blog posts will talk about the problem, various solutions, and what we did.   These posts are slightly more technical than other posts on this blog and I wonâ€™t be insulted if some of the more management types just skim through them ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The problem&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The system that we were working with has a very large repository (45 GB of text - images and other binary files are stored outside of the ZODB) that is continually being written to (tens of thousands of new objects a day).   They use FileStorage, rather than &lt;a href="http://zopewiki.org/DirectoryStorage"&gt;DirectoryStorage&lt;/a&gt;, because there are so many objects in the ZODB that the operating system would run out of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inode"&gt;inodes&lt;/a&gt;.   Because the database is so big and gets bombarded by so many write requests (the ZODB is effectively single threaded and is optimized for reading rather than writing), the systemâ€™s performance is just barely acceptable.  There is also a risk of data corruption which would lead to extensive down time which would be disastrous for this mission critical application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="http://www.zope.org/Products/CMF/"&gt;Zope CMF&lt;/a&gt; based application, everything is stored in the ZODB (except, in this case, binary files which are stored directly on the file system).  This includes objects themselves, version information, history, the search indexes (called portal_catalog), and, to some extent, code.  While the maintaining the search index represents a significant amount of overhead in this application, the primary target for removing from the ZODB was the actual content objects themselves because there was a desire to expose the content within the repository (read only) to non Python applications.  Oracle as a repository was particularly desirable because the client owns a site-license for Oracle and wants to leverage Oracleâ€™s capabilities of administration, tuning, and back-up and recovery.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system already uses &lt;a href="http://zopewiki.org/ZEO"&gt;ZEO&lt;/a&gt; but technologies that would relieve pressure on the storage tier, such as  &lt;a href="http://www.zope.com/products/zope_replication_services.html"&gt;Zope Replication Services&lt;/a&gt;, were tried and failed because of the write-intensity of the application.  The right solution would improve performance and store content in fielded data (as in relational tables) rather than the ZODB.  Also critical, the solution needed to go in smoothly with as little disruption as possible to the sophisticated and complex application sitting on top.  None of the existing solutions seemed to have much promise. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.zope.org/Products/OracleStorage"&gt;OracleStorage&lt;/a&gt; was ruled out because, in addition to being somewhat stagnant over the passed few years, it fails on the requirement of being open to non-Zope technologies.  OracleStorage stores Zope objects in &lt;a href="http://www.zvon.org/other/python/doc21/lib/module-pickle.html"&gt;Python Pickles&lt;/a&gt; which are serialized Python objects (equivalent to &lt;a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/io/Serializable.html"&gt;Serializable&lt;/a&gt; in Java.  Non-Python applications would have a difficult time reading pickles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The newer project &lt;a href="http://hathawaymix.org/Software/Ape"&gt;APE&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=â€http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mappingâ€&gt;Object-Relational Mapping&lt;/a&gt; layer for Zope (like &lt;a href="http://www.hibernate.org/"&gt;Hibernate&lt;/a&gt; in the Java world), looked like a viable option but earlier prototypes using APE suffered from performance.  There was also concern about how the underlying caching mechanism would behave under load.  The ultimate breaker was that the documentation on configuring APE was pretty thin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Another solution, which may still be used as a fall-back, was to have a nightly script that iterates through the ZODB and writes to an Oracle schema.  This would solve the problem of having the content available in a relational database, but it would not solve any performance issues and would not a safeguard against corruption.  This option could be selected in conjunction with Oracle storage if OracleStorage was more actively maintained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The solution that we wound up going with took advantage of a particular design characteristic of  the system: that all of a content asset's attributes were actually stored outside of the asset in a class derived from Zopeâ€™s &lt;a href="http://www.zope.org/Control_Panel/Products/OFSP/Help/PropertySheet.py"&gt;PropertySheet&lt;/a&gt;.    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next:  an overview of the solution we went with.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Google Sites and Sharepoint</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://www.cmswire.com"&gt;CMSWire&lt;/a&gt; has &lt;a href="http://www.cmswire.com/cms/enterprise-cms/google-bets-complexity-will-be-the-death-of-moss-002372.php"&gt;a nice little article on Google Sites and MOSS&lt;/a&gt;.  The general gist is that, while not as capable as &lt;a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepointserver/FX100492001033.aspx"&gt;MOSS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://sites.google.com/"&gt;Google Sites&lt;/a&gt; may be just good enough for basic websites and collaboration.  The absence of some advanced features may be compensated for by the simplicity of the platform.    Sometimes just good enough is exactly what you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over on the Sharepoint side, I just read &lt;a href="http://www.michaelsampson.net/"&gt;Michael Sampson's&lt;/a&gt; excellent report &lt;a href="http://co.michaelsampson.net/sp7p.html"&gt;The 7 Pillars of IT-Enabled Team Productivity: The Microsoft Shareport 2007 Analysis&lt;/a&gt;.  The report uses Michael's &lt;a href="http://co.michaelsampson.net/7pillars.html"&gt;7 Pillars framework&lt;/a&gt; to evaluate Sharepoint.  Not to be a spoiler but MOSS doesn't do so well.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not convinced that you want one platform to try do do everything but Michael assumes that this is Microsoft's goal (&lt;a href="http://www.cmswatch.com/Trends/1163-When-Microsoft-and-partners-don't-push-MOSS-2007-for-web-content-management"&gt;it certainly isn't building a robust WCM system&lt;/a&gt;).  So, it seems that Sharepoint is caught in the middle.  It is not the silver bullet, one-stop-shop for enterprise collaboration, and it is not the simple, cuddly tool that everyone loves to use.  That is not a very fun place to be.</content>

    <title>Just say no to standups</title>
    <content type='html'>I never liked regularly scheduled standup meetings. They interrupt your flow. They are boring because most of what is said has nothing to do with you. When an interesting topic does come up, the standup quickly transforms into a meeting-meeting that holds uninterested parties hostage. Standups are lame.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The good news is that, thanks to tools like Slack and Hipchat, we don't need to suffer through standups anymore. For around a year, my development teams having used ChICO (Checkin/Checkout) rooms. I got the idea from &lt;a href="https://logbook.hanno.co/nine-tools-to-keep-our-remote-team-together/"&gt;this blog post&amp;nbsp;by&amp;nbsp;Zsolt Kocsmarszky&lt;/a&gt;. When team members check in, they report what they are working on, who they need to work with, and any blockers they foresee. When they check out, they report what they accomplished and their plans for the next day.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This approach has multiple advantages over the classic standup.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;It does not need to be synchronous.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People report in and read at a time that works for them. They are alerted when a new announcement is made and can check it in their next stopping point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;It is scannable.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can scan over information that is not relevant.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;It is self documenting.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nobody needs to capture minutes or take notes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;It works well for geographically dispersed teams.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing is worse than a "phone standup" and, when timezones are involved, there is no good time to have them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;It cuts across language barriers.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This may be the biggest one for us. My team's written English skills are great but the spoken word is challenging due to accents and "buffering" (when the time it takes you to decipher a word and recall it's meaning makes you fall behind). Removing that barrier has brought my teams closer together on both personal and professional levels.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
Given these advantages, I am surprised when I hear about teams that still do standups. Please join me in saying no to these silly little meetings.&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>OpenCms Training</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://www.alkacon.com"&gt;Alkacon Software&lt;/a&gt; just &lt;a href="http://www.opencms.org/en/news/080226_public_training.html"&gt;announced that they are holding open training for OpenCms&lt;/a&gt;.  At the moment, the five day classes are only being delivered in Cologne but, with sufficient demand, they may be held in other venues.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.alkacon.com/en/products/training/complete.html"&gt;curriculum&lt;/a&gt; is designed for developers with sections on writing templates and using the OpenCms API.  Presumably, end users get an abbreviated customized training on their own implementation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OpenCms is one of the better documented open source CMS projects and I hear that a book on the new version 7 is in the works.  I have not been to an onsite OpenCms training, but the establishment of public training indicates that Alkacon has a repeatable and formal training curriculum. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A partner network and user community exist in the U.S. but not to the same level as Germany and the rest of Europe.  A big part of that is that OpenCms development and services primarily revolve around Alkacon Software and Alkacon has not pursued the U.S. market aggressively.  Perhaps Alkacon will partner with a few of the U.S. systems integrators to deliver the training as &lt;a href="http://www.alfresco.com"&gt;Alfresco&lt;/a&gt; has done with &lt;a href="http://www.rivetlogic.com"&gt;Rivet Logic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information on OpenCms, the &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/products-page/reports/open-source-web-content-management-in-opencms"&gt;OpenCms evaluation&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/products-page/reports/open-source-content-management-in-java"&gt;Open Source Web Content Management in Java&lt;/a&gt; report is available for individual purchase on the &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/reports"&gt;reports page&lt;/a&gt;.</content>

    <title>Google Hires Plone Founder</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Alexander Limi, co-founder of project and Plone and the main person behind the Plone user interface, recently announced that he has accepted a job offer at &lt;a href="http://www.google.com"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; where he will join their user interface design team.  When I first heard this news, I was concerned about the version 3.0 release which is designated as a UI focused release and which Limi has a central role.  I am somewhat comforted in knowing that Limi will actually have more time to work on this effort than he currently does thanks to Google's generous one day a week policy.  Google already supports many open source projects through its &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/soc/"&gt;Summer of Code program&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What about Limi's company &lt;a href="http://www.plonesolutions.com/"&gt;Plone Solutions?&lt;/a&gt;  Limi will remain on the board and remain active on projects that Plone Solutions is involved with (most notably &lt;a href="http://plone.org/products/linguaplone"&gt;LinguaPlone&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can see why Google recruited Alexander Limi.  Both Limi and the Google design teams appear to share the same design values of simplicity and cleanness.  Limi is famous for taking out more code than he puts in to keep the UI from becoming clunky, uncluttered, and non-compliant with accessibility standards (Plone is one of the most accessibility compliant CMS available.  So much so that many government organizations use Plone to ensure their compliance).  Also, Plone's focus on accessiblity has a side effect of making the generated HTML particularly usable by search engine crawlers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, I wish Alexander good luck on the new job and I am sure that the Plone community will keep him honest on his promise to stay involved.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>TYPO3 conference in Dallas this Spring</title>
    <content type='html'>One of the barriers to select &lt;a href="http://typo3.org/"&gt;TYPO3&lt;/a&gt; in North America has been the dearth of developers and systems integrators that know the platform.  This is in stark contrast to Germany where many consultancies and agencies are quite prolific with TYPO3.  In fact, TYPO3 has even has its own German print magazine &lt;a href="http://t3n.yeebase.com/"&gt;T3N&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So you could imagine my surprise when I found that there will be a &lt;a href="http://t3con09-dallas.typo3.org/home.html"&gt;T3Con in Dallas (as in  Texas) this Spring&lt;/a&gt;.  Details are still sparse and the lone organizer appears to be the German TYPO3 specialist &lt;a href="http://www.punkt.de"&gt;punkt&lt;/a&gt; (whose website is in German only).  If you know anything more about this event, please let me know.  I am intrigued.</content>

    <title>Hippo Launches Hippo CMS 7.0</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://www.onehippo.com/en/news,2009/01/Open-source-vendor-Hippo-launches-Hippo-CMS-versio.html"&gt;It's official&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="http://www.onehippo.org"&gt;Version 7&lt;/a&gt;, a near-total rewrite of Hippo CMS, is now GA.  Hippo CMS 7, formerly called ECM 1.0, is based on newer technologies &lt;a href="http://wicket.apache.org/"&gt;Apache Wicket&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://jackrabbit.apache.org/"&gt;JackRabbit&lt;/a&gt;.  This new architecture gets Hippo off of the complicated, difficult to learn &lt;a href="http://cocoon.apache.org/"&gt;Cocoon framework&lt;/a&gt; and the retired &lt;a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/slide/"&gt;Apache Slide&lt;/a&gt; project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One thing that I particularly like is that they have achieved a &lt;a href="http://www.onehippo.org/about/docs_guide/orphans/hippo-ecm-concepts/facets/facetsearch.html"&gt;compromise between the JCR's inherent hierarchical organization and a more free form faceted navigation&lt;/a&gt;.  Hippo CMS 7 is designed for high content volume websites and shows a lot of thinking in this area.  The faceted filters can be used at the API level by developers building websites on the platform.  Unfortunately, this functionality has not yet been surfaced in the user interface.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As with earlier versions of Hippo, version 7's architecture has a clean separation between the repository, the management application and the front end delivery tier.  Hippo CMS 7 gives developers a bit more of a starting point for building a front end website by shipping with a JSP tag library refers to display components managed in the CMS.   Developers are still free to roll their own delivery tier using whatever display technology they choose.  The standards-based Java Content Repository, plus frameworks like &lt;a href="http://incubator.apache.org/sling/site/index.html"&gt;Sling&lt;/a&gt;, will make custom Hippo powered websites easier to build.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hippo CMS 7 has a plugins framework that facilitates adding new functionality to the platform.  There &lt;a href="http://forge.onehippo.org"&gt;Hippo Forge site&lt;/a&gt; will be a place for the community to share their components and tools.  These plugins surface on the dashboard and in other areas of UI and are better encapsulated than Hippo 6.x customizations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/38298452@N00/3229154322" title="View 'hippo7-edit-blg' on Flickr.com"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3523/3229154322_cf76a56813.jpg" alt="hippo7-edit-blg" border="0" width="500" height="361" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the UI side, Hippo CMS 7 shares some basic concepts with earlier versions of the platform.  Version 6.x users will recognize the stateful tabs but will appreciate a new three column layout that allows a user to browse the repository and edit multiple content items at once (see screenshot).  There are several other AJAX-enabled goodies like type-ahead search and linking and image placement through drag and drop.  If you have seen Day's new CQ5 UI, there are some similarities there.  In fact, an alpha of Hippo CMS 7 won second place in the Web Idol demo competition at the &lt;a href="http://jboye08.dk/"&gt;jboye08 conference last November&lt;/a&gt;.  Hippo has plans to create specialized versions of the user interface to optimize the usability for specific user segments.  For example, they are working on a user interface view that is optimized for power users on wide-screen displays that will maximize the use of the multi-column layout.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Being a new product, there only 2 customers live on Hippo CMS 7.  Two more implementations are in progress.  The documentation is not going to win Pulitzer but I have found the mailing lists to be very helpful.  If you like what you see, I would recommend setting up some kind of arrangement with the Hippo team where they work closely with your implementation and they can submit fixes/improvements back into the core.  Current 6.x customers will be supported by a dedicated V6 team who will maintain the platform with fixes and minor enhancements.  No new support contracts will be sold for V6.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a big release for Hippo CMS.  Usability-wise, there are significant improvements - particularly for power users managing large content repositories.  Architecturally, CMS 7 offers a more modern technology stack that flattens the learning curve and enables more efficient development of the product.  With a couple of successful implementations on the 7.x series, Hippo CMS may get it some deserved attention (particularly in North America where it is not widely known).</content>

    <title>Your content stinks</title>
    <content type='html'>Gerry McGovern has a &lt;a href="http://www.cmswire.com/cms/web-content/web-content-migration-disastrous-strategy-003588.php"&gt;brilliant article on CMSWire that compares the common habit of migrating bad content into a new CMS to pouring sour milk into a different bottle.&lt;/a&gt;  To quote:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Another team is assembled to take the old jug and migrate its contents into the new portal jug. Once all the putrefied milk has been drained into the new portal jug thereâ€™s high-fives and lattes all-round. Job well done, Joe! Project complete.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the first things that I talk to my clients about during a CMS selection is whether or not they need a new CMS in the first place.  This year, I have talked three clients out of buying a new CMS.  Sometimes it is just a matter of organizational neglect and bad content - and neither has anything to do with technology.  Other times the CMS is difficult to use because the client made it that way by implementing onerous workflows and a bad content model.  A simple upgrade and re-customization would fix those problems.    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another metaphor that I find effective is getting a new car when the ashtray is full but then emptying the contents of the old ashtray into the new car.  But that doesn't have the visceral impact of rotting milk.</content>

    <title>Web Content 2009 Conference in Chicago</title>
    <content type='html'>The &lt;a href="http://www.webcontentconferences.com/chicago/2009"&gt;Web Content Conference in Chicago (June 15-16)&lt;/a&gt; is running a special promotion of &lt;a href="https://www.gifttool.com/registrar/ShowEventDetails?ID=1208&amp;EID=4681"&gt;$100 off the regular registration price&lt;/a&gt;.  I have spoken at this conference twice and consider it a &lt;em&gt;hidden gem&lt;/em&gt; in the content management conference scene.  The atmosphere is non-commercial and down to earth, the &lt;a href="http://www.webcontentconferences.com/chicago/2009/presenters/"&gt;speakers&lt;/a&gt; are exceptional, and the audience is knowledgeable and engaged.  If you can get to Chicago this summer and you want to learn about ways to leverage web content, attending this conference is an obvious choice.</content>

    <title>The &amp;quot;Moving Truck&amp;quot; school of project estimation</title>
    <content type='html'>Estimation has long been a point of embarrassment for the software development community. A big part of that is unrealistic expectations set by association with construction and manufacturing industries. Software is unlike building houses and widgets because every software application is unique and unprecedented, whereas construction and manufacturing most often involve assembling well-understood components in repeatable ways. Truly innovative construction projects, like the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Dig"&gt;Big Dig&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Opera_House"&gt;Sydney Opera House&lt;/a&gt;, regularly overrun their estimates (by 3 times and 15 times respectively in these cases). They shouldn't be compared with building out a subdivision either.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A more appropriate analogy is a moving truck. If you have ever hired movers to help you move between homes, you know that the process starts by someone walking through your house and looking over your stuff. This person may pull out a tape measure a few times but she is not measuring everything and she is certainly not doing things like seeing if your ottoman can be neatly wedged underneath your dinner table. The real purpose of the exercise is to know how big a truck (and team) to bring on moving day. It is up to the movers to make the most of the space and there is a real art to that. Sometimes the moving team can see right away that the job is going to be a real squeeze and they think through every piece like a game of Tetris. But sometimes the truck is just too small, you need to call in another truck. Either that or pulverize your furniture into very compact dust.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main point of this analogy is that precise software estimation is impossible at the detail level. It takes people who have done lots of projects to give a decent "truck-size" estimate, and even then they can be wrong. In fact, each task estimate will likely be wrong. Accuracy is achieved only at the aggregate level when the underestimates cancel out the overestimates. Just as important, an experienced team will be quick to identify the need to adjust: either by increasing the scope (size of the truck), by leaving low value items on the curb (decreasing scope), or by changing how things are packed together. The earlier you are aware of your constraints the more options you will have.  Only inexperienced teams wait until the truck is full to realize that some adjustments need to be made.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Related: &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2010/07/work-breakdown-structure-vs-deadlines.html"&gt;Work Breakdown Structure vs. Deadlines&lt;/a&gt;</content>

    <title>Vendor Demos Continued</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Following in the vein of Tony Byrne's &lt;a href="http://www.cmswatch.com/Feature/163-Better-Demos"&gt;10 Steps to a Successful Vendor Demo&lt;/a&gt; and my post on &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2007/09/how-to-make-the-most-out-of-a-vendor-demo.html"&gt;how to sit through one&lt;/a&gt; , here is a link to Joel Spolsky's &lt;a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2007/11/16.html"&gt;How to Demo Software&lt;/a&gt; article. Besides being an entertaining read (as all Joel's posts are), I think this article re-enforces the importance of the performance and other production values to a vendor demo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content>

    <title>Yeah, That&amp;#39;s a Favicon</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/38298452@N00/3234749415" title="View 'Content Here Favicon' on Flickr.com"&gt;&lt;img src="http://static.flickr.com/3087/3234749415_5b7cdbd9f7.jpg" alt="Content Here Favicon" border="0" width="" height="" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Content Here's new Favicon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.marketingvox.com"&gt;Marketing Vox&lt;/a&gt; has an article describing &lt;a href="http://www.marketingvox.com/google-tests-site-favicons-in-select-search-results-042938/?utm_campaign=rssfeed&amp;utm_source=mv&amp;utm_medium=textlink"&gt;Google's plan to show favicons in search result listings&lt;/a&gt; (thanks &lt;a href="http://friendfeed.com/ajkohn"&gt;AJ Kohn&lt;/a&gt; for the link!).  For the uninitiated, favicons are those little pictures that sometimes appear to the left of the URL in your browser's address bar.  This is an interesting departure from Google's text-only policy on search results and it gives webmasters a new way to distinguish their websites.  For now, Google is only going to do this on site specific searches (like when you type "&lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=java+web+content+management+site%3Awww.contenthere.net&amp;btnG=Search"&gt;java web content management site:www.contenthere.net&lt;/a&gt;").  Google's sparse style could get very busy looking when cluttered with 10 little pictures per page.  Speaking of ugly, does anyone like Google's new favicon?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Creating a favicon is easy.  All you need to do is make a square image and then use a &lt;a href="http://www.html-kit.com/favicon/"&gt;site like HTML-Kit to generate the favicon.ico file&lt;/a&gt;.  Put it in your web root and then you are done.  A little side benefit is that you won't see any more of those warning messages in your web logs saying it can't find the favicon.ico file.</content>

    <title>Is your workflow working for you?</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;This is the third installment of a series of articles on &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2011/03/what-is-a-content-management-assessment.html"&gt;content management assessment&lt;/a&gt;.  The most recent article ("&lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2011/03/have-you-modeled-your-content-effectively.html"&gt;Have you modeled your content effectively?&lt;/a&gt;") introduced warning signs that may indicate that your CMS implementation can be improved by adjusting your content model.  In this installment, we will be looking at how you did with workflow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Workflow has always been a key selling point for content management systems.  In sales demonstrations, multi-step workflows give the impression of efficiency and time-savings.  Workflow holds the promise of being able to  choreograph the presently inconsistent efforts of different stakeholders to achieve high levels of efficiency and consistency.  Workflow represents the "Management" in the CMS value proposition.  Who doesn't want to transform their chaos of content into a well oiled publishing machine?  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the real world, however, the editorial process is often less repeatable and the manufacturing metaphor doesn't fit so well.  It takes time to figure out what aspects of the editorial process are stable enough to encode into a workflow.  Maybe the reason people are not doing their content tasks is something other than not knowing about them &amp;mdash; like other responsibilities have a higher priority or they procrastinate.  Unfortunately, CMS buyers often reach this level of understanding &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the budget has run out.  The result is a system that is over-engineered to support some idealized representation of the editorial process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some key questions to determine if your organization has fallen into the workflow trap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        &lt;h3&gt;Did the workflow that you wanted to accelerate publishing slow it down?&lt;/h3&gt;There are really two purposes for workflow: to speed publishing up or to slow it down.  A workflow speeds up publishing when it coordinates a creative process.  For example, a graphics person may be responsible for finding and editing images to be used in the content.  Workflow can also execute automated steps such as tagging and placing the item in the site hierarchy.  You can think of a little content assembly line here where different specialists and robots all have their role in producing the asset.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Workflow slows down publishing when it is used to support a review process.  The function of reviewers is to send back content that is inaccurate, inappropriate, or off-message.  The reality is that most organizations dream for the assembly line but wind up building review-oriented workflows.  Often new review steps are added when a workflow is implemented.  It is much easier to find reviewers than it is to find creative specialists that can speed up content production.  &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        &lt;h3&gt;Do contributors find themselves clicking through workflow steps without actually doing work?&lt;/h3&gt;When collecting requirements and selecting a CMS, it is good to look at your editorial process and a natural outcome of this analysis is a flow chart.  Like any diagram or model, when you are making it, you know that you trying to illustrate how the process &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;usually&lt;/em&gt; works &amp;mdash; not how everyone &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; work all the time.  You might have even overstated the complexity just to make sure that you select a product with flexibility just in case you need it in the future.  Many CMS products have visual workflow designers that can transform that flowchart into a workflow that drives your editorial process.  The next thing you know, boxes that were put in the diagram for talking points (like something that one would do offline) become mandatory steps that people have to click through &amp;mdash; formalities that provide no value.  Asking this question may also hint at a common syndrome in web content management where all of the editorial process happens before the content is even put into the system.  Users often prefer ad-hoc tools and processes to generate and review content and the web content management system is simply used as a publishing tool to get it out to the various digital channels that it serves (web, mobile web, applications, RSS, Twitter, etc.).  There is nothing wrong with this unless you pretend that you are doing all this editorial work in the system and you have to unnecessarily click buttons to imitate the work that you already did.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Do contributors find themselves playing multiple roles in a workflow?&lt;/h3&gt;During a CMS selection, design, and implementation there is a tendency to be inclusive.  You want to engage potential users to design a system that will work for everyone.  Everyone is a stakeholder; everyone has a role in managing content.  People attend the meetings and play along. It's fun to talk about content and communication .... until actual workflow assignments start to pile up in their queues.  Then all of the sudden people get less interested in having their approval be a bottleneck in the editorial flow.  People bail out leaving the hardy core content team to play roles that were abandoned.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Are there workflows that are rarely used?&lt;/h3&gt;Workflow, like any business process optimization, requires trial and error and continuous improvement.  When a workflow doesn't seem to work for an editorial group, content type, or circumstance, there can be an urge to build a new workflow.  This is especially the case if workflows are fine-grained and tightly bound to individual people.  This often leads to a proliferation of workflows that clutter the interface and confuse users.  When you see this happen, it is useful to step back and ask if every nuance of every process needs to be encoded into the software as a formal workflow.  Can decision points for special cases happen outside of the workflow?  For example, perhaps once a year there is an annual report that needs to be reviewed by the CFO.  This is the only piece of content that the CFO needs to review.  In this case, it would probably be better to handle that step as part of a more generalized step.  Perhaps, during the legal review step the corporate council (who reviews lots of content) knows that he needs CFO approval so he works with the CFO out of the CMS to review the documents (perhaps in email or some collaboration tool).  &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is healthy to look at every step of a process and consider its positive or negative impact towards outcomes.  This is what &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_manufacturing"&gt;Lean Production and value stream mapping&lt;/a&gt; is all about.  The workflow engine that comes with a CMS can help by forcing conversations about processes and how they can be improved.  However, most of the workflows that are implemented to guide these processes wind up wasting time on formality that doesn't apply.  Because of this, workflow tends to be the most over-sold and under-used CMS feature. To get the most out of a workflow system, you need to have goals for the process that it supports.  Are you primarily focused on time to market?  Maybe direct-publish is the way to go.  Are there automatable steps like publishing a link to Twitter?  Workflow can help by providing an event-based trigger to execute some code.  Are you focused on brand consistency or compliance?  Start measuring your success against those goals and figure out how to achieve high scores with as little effort as possible.  The workflow capabilities of your CMS may assist improvements but they may also get in the way.  If you don't use workflow properly, don't blame the CMS. &lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>10 Django Master Class action items</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit: I wrote a &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2010/04/django-action-item-follow-up.html"&gt;follow-up post describing how I was doing with these action items&lt;/a&gt;.  Enjoy!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago I attended &lt;a href="http://jacobian.org/"&gt;Jacob Kaplan-Moss&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="http://holdenweb.com/py/djangomaster/"&gt;Django Master Class&lt;/a&gt; in Springfield, Virginia.  It was a great class and I walked out with a bunch of ideas for making better use of &lt;a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/"&gt;Django&lt;/a&gt;.  What follows is a set of action items that I created for myself.  Jacob was not this prescriptive in his presentation.  These are just my personal decisions based on how he explained things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use &lt;a href="http://south.aeracode.org/"&gt;South&lt;/a&gt; for database migrations (complete)&lt;/strong&gt;.  Unlike &lt;a href="http://rubyonrails.org/"&gt;Rails&lt;/a&gt;, Django has no native system for synchronizing the database schema with code changes.  Django will create your initial database schema for you but you need to modify the tables with SQL whenever your models change.  South gives Django Rails-like migrations which consists of methods to alter the database and also roll-back changes.  I ported a new application I am working on over to use South and am very impressed.  Jacob gave some great advice to keep your schema migrations from your data migrations.  For example, if you are renaming a field: you would create one migration to add the field; a second migration to move the data to the new field; and a third migration to delete the old field.  Doing this will make your migrations safer and easier to roll-back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use PostgreSQL rather than MySQL (complete)&lt;/strong&gt;.  Jacob didn't talk disparagingly about MySQL but it was clear to me that PostgreSQL is what the cool kids are using.  That is not to say there are not disagreements over what DB is best.  I have been using MySQL for years but two things won me over.  In the class, I learned that table alterations in MySQL are not transactional so if your South database migration fails, you can't roll-back so easily.  The second factor came after the class when I was reading all these blog posts panicking about what will come of MySQL now that Oracle owns it.  I agree with most pundits that Oracle doesn't have a great reason to invest in MySQL.  My comfort level working with PostgreSQL is growing but its going to take a while to get as comfortable with the commands and syntax as I am with MySQL.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use &lt;a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv"&gt;VirtualEnv&lt;/a&gt; (complete)&lt;/strong&gt;.  One thing about Python that always seemed hackey to me was the whole "site-packages" thing.  I don't like how all your Python projects tend to share the same libraries.  In Java, you are much more deliberate with your CLASSPATH. The class introduced me to virtualenv and its sister project &lt;a href="http://www.doughellmann.com/projects/virtualenvwrapper/"&gt;virtualenvwrapper&lt;/a&gt;.  This creates a virtual sandbox where you can manage libraries separately from your main Python installation.  It is brilliant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use &lt;a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip"&gt;PIP&lt;/a&gt; (complete)&lt;/strong&gt;.  I was pretty haphazard about what tools I used to install Python packages.  I admit that I didn't really know the difference between setuptools and easy_install.  The Master Class nicely explained the different options and it seems like PIP is emerging as the Python package manager of choice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Break up functionality into lots of small re-usable applications (in process)&lt;/strong&gt;.  Much of the advice from the class is summarized in &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-S0tqpPga4"&gt;James Bennett's DjangoCon 2008 talk: Reusable Apps&lt;/a&gt;.  Watch the video and be convinced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use &lt;a href="http://docs.fabfile.org/0.9/"&gt;Fabric&lt;/a&gt; for deployments (not started)&lt;/strong&gt;.  My normal m.o. for deploying code has been to shell over to a server and svn export from my Subversion server.  In multiple server environments, I would usually have some kind of rsync setup.  However, in my one of my client projects (using Java), I started using &lt;a href="http://www.anthillpro.com/html/default.html"&gt;AntHill Pro&lt;/a&gt; (plus Ant) for both continuous integration and deployment.  From that experience I saw light on the automated deployments.   Fabric is primitive compared to AntHill Pro (it doesn't have cool web-based UI) but it does allow you to run scripts remotely on other hosts.  It's like &lt;a href="http://www.capify.org/index.php/Capistrano"&gt;Capistrano&lt;/a&gt; for Python.  In the next phase of development, I will definitely be using this.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use &lt;a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/models/fixtures/"&gt;Django Fixtures&lt;/a&gt; (not started)&lt;/strong&gt;.  I am really embarrassed to say that I have avoided using Fixtures for loading lookup and test data.  Instead, I have been doing horrid things with SQL and objects.create().   I am looking forward to reforming my errant ways.  Fixtures allow you to create a data file that Django will load for you.  It offers three format options: JSON, YAML, or XML.  Jacob recommends YAML if you can be assured that you have access to &lt;a href="http://pyyaml.org/"&gt;PyYAML&lt;/a&gt;, otherwise go with JSON which is nearly as readable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Look into the &lt;a href="http://farmdev.com/projects/fixture/"&gt;Python Fixture&lt;/a&gt; module (not started)&lt;/strong&gt;.  This straight Python module seems to be an alternative to the Django fixtures system.  It is more oriented towards test data and looks a little like using mock objects.  I need to dig in a little more before I make up my mind about it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use django.test.TestCase more for unit testing (not started)&lt;/strong&gt;.  I need to do more with unit tests.  I have had some good experiences with writing DocTests but I should use the Django unit test framework more.  This will allow me to use fixtures more too!  Plus with Django 1.1, startapp even creates a tests.py for you.  How can I resist an empty .py file?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use the highest version of Python that you can get away with (in progress)&lt;/strong&gt;.  In the class, Jacob made the good point that every version of Python gets feature and performance improvements.  Why not go with the latest stable version like 2.6?  Snow Leopard did it for me.  I will try to upgrade my server as soon as I can get away with it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you can make it to the next Django Master Class, I highly recommend you go.  Otherwise, you should look into these resources and make your own educated decisions about whether to use them.  &lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Gilbane Enterprise Blog Survey</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.gilbane.com"&gt;The Gilbane Report&lt;/a&gt; recently &lt;a href="http://gilbane.com/surveys.html"&gt;posted the results of their Survey on Enterprise blog, wiki, and RSS Use&lt;/a&gt;.  While the survey sample is not representative of a larger population of companies (the survey was voluntary and Gilbane readers are probably ahead of the curve), the results are interesting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the 58 respondents (mostly from companies under $25MM in annual revenues but 10 from companies of over $1 Billion in annual revenues.):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Over 35 use Blog or Wiki technology&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;More of the Blog/Wiki users use them for knowledge management and internal information dissemination, than customer communication.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;More than half of the respondents get support for their Blog or Wiki from their internal IT organization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>The Risk of Static-ness</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;The Real Story Group recently published an interesting diagram showing &lt;a href="http://www.realstorygroup.com/Blog/2092-2011-Web-CMS-Marketplace-Overview" rel="nofollow"&gt;one of the ways that their 2011 Web Content Management report views the marketplace&lt;/a&gt;.  Overall, I really like the approach of looking at the dual dimensions of the product and the supplier and it is interesting how the various products are placed on the diagram.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The one aspect that doesn't quite sit right with me is the implication that less investment in the product translates into less risk for the customers.  In my opinion, there is extreme risk in products that are getting minimal development.  Static-ness can be the first sign of decline.  The supplier (be it a commercial software vendor or open source development community) may be losing interest in the product and is reducing investment.  You could say that this risk is captured in the vendor restructuring dimension as downsizing the group managing the product.  Still, I think that risk on the product development axis is higher on both extremes.  In the example of the diagram, if Microsoft invested even less in their WCM Platform, I think risk would increase.  Anyone remember Microsoft Content Management Server 2002?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;BTW, I tried to add this as a comment to the post IntenseDebate appeared to be swallowing my comments :)&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Nuxeo Core moving to Eclipse</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I have been thinking a lot about &lt;a href="http://ebarroca.com/2011/02/nuxeo-open-source-content-repository-move-eclipse/"&gt;Nuxeo's recent announcement that it is contributing Nuxeo Core to the Eclipse Foundation&lt;/a&gt;.  First, I agree with &lt;a href="http://www.cmswire.com/cms/enterprise-cms/nuxeo-contributes-its-cmis-supported-content-repository-to-eclipse-foundation-010127.php"&gt;Josette Rigsby's observation that this move could make Nuxeo the JackRabbit of CMIS&lt;/a&gt;.  JCR watchers probably remember that &lt;a href="http://www.day.com/day/en.html"&gt;Day Software's&lt;/a&gt; development of an open source reference implementation (&lt;a href="http://jackrabbit.apache.org/"&gt;Apache JackRabbit&lt;/a&gt;) was critical to the success of the JCR standard.  Even though there are a lot of people questioning the success of the JCR standard right now, you can't argue that the JCR didn't have an impact on the Java CMS ecosystem and continues to be &lt;a href="http://blogs.onehippo.org/arje/2011/01/is_jcr_dead_so_what_if_it_is.html"&gt;an important part of a number of Java CMS architectures&lt;/a&gt;.  It would be quite a coup if Nuxeo was to be name that comes to mind when people think Java and CMIS.  &lt;a href="http://www.alfresco.com"&gt;Alfresco&lt;/a&gt; has had that distinction since they were the early adopters of CMIS in the Java community and &lt;a href="http://newton.typepad.com/content/2008/09/alfresco-releases-first-cmis-implementation.html"&gt;released the first CMIS implementation.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other part of the announcement that intrigued me was why they went to the &lt;a href="http://www.eclipse.org/"&gt;Eclipse Foundation&lt;/a&gt; and not the &lt;a href="http://www.apache.org"&gt;Apache Software Foundation&lt;/a&gt;.  After all, Apache already has &lt;a href="http://incubator.apache.org/chemistry/"&gt;Chemistry&lt;/a&gt;, which is a collection of projects that implement the CMIS standard.  My first reaction was that Nuxeo thinks the ASF is broken since &lt;a href="http://www.apache.org/jcp/"&gt;its tiff with the Java Community Process&lt;/a&gt;.  That may be so but I think there are better explanations.  First, Chemistry already has a number of projects and it is still in the incubation stage.  Perhaps Nuxeo feels that these aspects would dilute Nuxeo's influence.  Second, Nuxeo has had a long relationship with Eclipse.  Back in 2006, &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2006/02/the-apogee-project.html"&gt;Nuxeo announced the Apogee project&lt;/a&gt;.  Apogee is an RCP (an Eclipse build), designed to be a universal thick CMS client.  Apogee never really caught on in the general marketplace, but I know that Nuxeo has been very successful implementing it for their customers as an efficient user interface for their own CMS.  With the advantages of influence and the Eclipse Foundation's community and resources, Nuxeo Core may have great potential as the &lt;a href="http://www.eclipse.org/proposals/rt.ecr/"&gt;Eclipse Enterprise Content Repository Project (ECR)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>The Real World of Open Source Application Implementations: Case Studies
from the Front Line</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Last week I spoke on a panel about real world experiences about the cost of open source.  Unfortunately, the panel was not publicized and no one but the speakers knew about it.  Despite the lack of attendance, I found the session (which turned into a sort of round table discussion) very interesting.  The following people participated in the conversation:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Terry Barbounis, Chief Technology Officer, &lt;a href="http://csmonitor.com/"&gt;The Christian Science Monitor&lt;/a&gt;.  They are changing the way they work with software and are building many of their new applications on open source.  Terry also brought along his lead applications architect, Russ Danner who had several insightful comments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chris Chicoine, Director of IT, &lt;a href="http://athenahealth.com/Home"&gt;AthenaHealth&lt;/a&gt;.  AthenaHealth has one of the most (if not THE most) sophisticated &lt;a href="http://www.sugarcrm.com/crm/"&gt;SugarCRM&lt;/a&gt; deployment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maurizio Ferconi, Managing Director, Financial Engineering, &lt;a href="http://www.putnam.com/"&gt;Putnam Investments&lt;/a&gt;.  Putnam has seen a huge ROI using open source at the infrastructure layer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ron Bongo, CEO, &lt;a href="http://www.corratech.com/open-source/solutions.html"&gt;CorraTech&lt;/a&gt;.  Does a lot of systems integration work with SugarCRM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://asay.blogspot.com/"&gt;Matt Asay&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="http://www.alfresco.com/"&gt;Alfresco&lt;/a&gt; moderated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://contenthere.blogspot.com"&gt;Me&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For anyone who missed it (and everyone did).  Here are some of my notes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Competitors are collaborating about technology selection. Maurizio said one of his most trusted information sources are his peers at other companies.  The core technologies do not make the competitive advantage.  It is how they are integrated and used.  Other useful information: word of mouth, general buzz, web research, and Venture capitalists [although, personally speaking, I find that VCs are always trying to push their portfolio companies].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Christian Science Monitor is very active in both the developer and user communities.  Terry sees community interaction as one of the real benefits of using open source software.  The exchange of information and ideas is extremely valuable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;AthenaHealth uses best of breed over suites.  They selected SugarCRM because they needed to build an extremely custom system and selected Sugar as a base because of its rapid growth and community buzz.  The Christian Science Monitor uses more of a best of solution approach where they prioritize fitness to a specific use over generic best of breed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Putnam uses open source to get better leverage on commercial software vendors.  The open source option forces commercial software vendors towards reasonable pricing, better standards support, and more innovative features.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;All agreed that if you choose open source in order create a heavily customized unique application, go in with your eyes wide open because you are in for some software development.  Of course, this is no different from commercial software.  The only difference is that open source gives you more latitude to customize if you wish to.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Everyone is using open source in mission critical applications.  Terry talked about the responsibility he bears in supporting journalists who endure great risk to post their stories each day.  Reliability is a key requirement and the panel agreed that they are finding this reliability in open source software.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;</content>

    <title>Drupal for Newspapers</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Readers of &lt;a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/77085653/Drupal-for-Publishers"&gt;Drupal for Publishers&lt;/a&gt; know that Drupal has been very successful in the small to medium newspaper market.  In fact, the &lt;a href="http://groups.drupal.org/newspapers-on-drupal"&gt;Newspapers on Drupal group&lt;/a&gt; is assembling a &lt;a href="http://groups.drupal.org/node/5281"&gt;list of modules commonly used by newspapers&lt;/a&gt;. This effort has been going on for some time but there has been renewed energy because the older list was oriented around the outdated 5.x series of Drupal.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is also a Drupal distribution for newspapers called &lt;a href="http://www.prosepoint.org/"&gt;ProsePoint&lt;/a&gt; that bundles Drupal, many of the modules listed by the Newspapers on Drupal Group, and some other third party code.  I think that creating &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2005/12/plone-distros.html"&gt;vertical specific distributions of software is a neat idea&lt;/a&gt; and there are lots of great examples.  Gartner has been talking about CEVAs (Content Enabled Vertical Applications) for years but it is unlikely that their commercial software vendor audience will be as quick to capitalize on the idea as open source communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;From an open source community perspective, vertical distros introduces interesting dynamics.  On the one hand, these groups definitely strengthen the bond within segments of the community who can benefit greatly by collaborating with peers with very similar needs.  On the other hand, specialization of community segments requires strong central leadership to maintain common ground and prevent the different groups from becoming too self absorbed and self interested.  I don't think this is a problem in the Drupal world because leaders in the Newspapers on Drupal community seem to have a very strong belief in and commitment to the Drupal project as a whole.  For now, at least, this very active constituency seems to be nothing but a positive force in the greater Drupal movement.  &lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>The Scooter vs. The Minivan</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://hobbsontech.com/content/planning-vacations-and-websites"&gt;David Hobbs has written an excellent post about how  managing a website needs to change as your site grows&lt;/a&gt;.  He draws a comparison with traveling alone vs. with a family: spontaneity vs. stability.  To quote:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;But, as with websites, this really isn't about one mode of travel being the "right" one is it?  If you're just out of university backpacking around Asia, then sure be spontaneous.  If you're single traveling on business, then take advantage of features that might not be worth it to the backpacker (like taking a taxi ride straight from the airport to hotel, rather then a series of public transportation that might make sense when backpacking).  If you're traveling with a family, then maybe a more planned approach with less stops makes sense.  But the point is that there is no single "answer" to the best way to travel, like with websites.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;David makes the point that the supporting organization has to adapt to the needs of the website. Some companies transition more proactively and gracefully than others.  In the post, David mentions "subsites" as added complexity.  I think this is interesting because many organizations look at subsites (marketing landing pages, campaign pages, product sites) as a way to escape the complexity of their main site. It's a little bit like a weekend get-away without the kids.  But over time, these subsites become part of the overall web program's complexity.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Repository-Based vs. Presentation-Based Search</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Search is probably the most common visitor-facing requirement in web content management system implementations.  Usually the requirement is written in terse form such as "basic search" or "advanced search." But there are many nuances that need to be accounted for. There are essentially two approaches to implementing search requirements: repository-based search and page-based search.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A repository-based search indexes content items in the content repository.  A page-based search indexes the pages of the site.  This distinction is more important than you might think &amp;mdash; especially if the site design heavily re-uses content.  Here is an example. Let's say your site has pictures that are presented in slideshows.  The picture content type has a caption that is searchable.  A page-based search for a word in the caption of a picture will return the slideshow(s) where the picture is used.  A repository-based search will return the picture item itself &amp;mdash; but what if there is no detail page for the picture content type?  You might have to do something like create a fake detail page that redirects the user to a slideshow page.  Another difference is that a page-based search will index text that is hard coded into the presentation templates.  For example, you might have your hours of operation in the footer of every page of the site and a "Visit" page that contains the hours plus directions.  If a visitor types "hours" into a page-based search engine, he will get every page on the site in the results.  A repository-based search engine will return the "Visit" page.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Generally speaking, the search functionality that comes out of the box in a CMS is repository-based.  This is necessary because content contributors need a repository-based search to navigate the repository and find content to work on.  Some of this content has not yet even been published on the site.  Whether you need a page-based search engine for your visitors to use will depend on the nature of your site.  Most types of websites do better with a page-based visitor search because a page is a good enough proxy for a piece of content and page-based search engines are generally easier to set up (look how easy it is to set up Google Custom Search).  However, page-based search doesn't work well for all sites.  In an eCommerce site that has a product catalog, you want to index the products themselves, not all the pages where the products are promoted.  If you have requirements for a fielded search, like finding calendar events that occur within a date range, you will also need a repository-based search that indexes individual fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, next time you are thinking about search, think about whether you want the search engine to index the pages on your site or the content that is being presented in those pages.  As with all requirements, the best way to capture search requirements is through scenarios that present real-world examples.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>How to Select a CMS</title>
    <content type='html'>A while back, I wrote a &lt;a title="post" href="/2006/10/selecting-a-cms.html"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; on selecting a CMS.  I have since gotten requests for more step by step instructions.  While, the process is not so formulaic that it can be written into a recipe, this is the Content Here approach.  This methodology is optimized for the complex content management projects.   Some of the steps require a deep background in the content management marketplace or help from an expert.  But here they are.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Document the content types.&lt;/span&gt; Before doing anything, you need to know about the content that is to be managed: its structure, frequency of creation and updates, and who is responsible for it.  Usually, this is a good time to visualize better ways of structuring, organizing, and managing content assets.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Document the scenarios.&lt;/span&gt; Write short, narrative-based scenarios describing what the system will be used for and how.  Stay away from implementation specific details as much as possible.  For example, rather than say "the user clicks a 'check spelling' button and the system lists misspelled words," say "the system notifies the user of misspelled words."  This leaves it open to the product to determine the best way to meet the requirement - is it with color underlining as the user types?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Document the legacy systems.&lt;/span&gt; Most Content Here clients require integration with legacy systems.  It is important to understand them, how they are deployed, and their interfaces.  A diagram showing the existing enterprise architecture and how the content management platform fits in is very helpful.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Filter by technology.&lt;/span&gt; While content management is all about usability, start by developing a short list of products that are technically capable of meeting the requirements.  The biggest reason for doing this is that evaluating for usability is such a subjective and intensive process and it is impractical for both the customer (and the vendor) to demo more than a couple of products (you will see this later on).  You might have some non-functional constraints like the system has to be customized in Java or run on Windows.  To do this step effectively, you really need to be immersed in the marketplace and know the different products and who is using them for what.  Buy a &lt;a title="CMS Watch" href="http://www.cmswatch.com/"&gt;CMS Watch&lt;/a&gt; report (&lt;a title="WCM" href="http://www.cmswatch.com/CMS/Report/"&gt;WCM&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a title="ECM" href="http://www.cmswatch.com/ECM/Report/"&gt;ECM&lt;/a&gt;) or hire a consultant (like &lt;a title="Content Here" href="http://www.contenthere.net/"&gt;Content Here&lt;/a&gt;) or, better yet, do both.  Based on the questions that I get, I think that sites like &lt;a title="CMS Matrix" href="http://www.cmsmatrix.org/"&gt;CMS Matrix&lt;/a&gt; are more likely to confuse you than help you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Filter by price.&lt;/span&gt; If a product is way beyond your price range, you should either filter it out or see if there alternative licensing models that meet your budget.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Engage with the vendors.&lt;/span&gt; If you have been following the steps 1 through 5, you should understand your content management requirements and have a short list of 3 or so products that would all probably work in your environment.  The next step is to find the product that your users will feel the most comfortable using.  Hopefully, the software vendor understands your needs and will partner with you to meet them.  If two products are very close functionally, I tend to go with the vendor that will be more helpful in the initial implementation and beyond.  This is where I think the traditional RFP process is broken.   Rather than create a formal procurement process that tries to compare "apples to apples," you want an informal, interactive process that will &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;highlight the differences between the vendors and their approaches&lt;/span&gt;.  You want to share as much information with them as you can.  If you don't trust a vendor, they should not be on your short list.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Prototype and learn.&lt;/span&gt; Because each vendor on your short list has a good chance of winning the deal, and you are not giving him a 100 page RFP to answer, he should be willing to invest the time to build a prototype that will demonstrate how his product will support your content types and usage scenarios.  If an open source product is on your short list, consider building your own prototype or paying a systems integrator to do it (this will give you an idea of what it is like to work with the systems integrator).   You should evaluate the prototype as actively as you can.  Ask what can be changed and how.  Ask the vendor to give you access to the prototype so that users can play with it at their own desks.  Have your users think outside of their normal day to day and be innovative.  Teach them about best practices in content management.Hopefully, the prototype demonstration was like a training session so the business users are comfortable finding their way around the system.  If you intend to have your technical staff help with the implementation and/or maintenance of the system, now is a good time to request the developer documentation and access to the customer support site.  Schedule a technical session where the prototype builder walks through the code and configuration that he did to build the prototype.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Project what an implementation would look like. &lt;/span&gt;To get an idea of the total cost of the solution, do a project planning exercise of what it would take to implement the solution and customizations and migrate your content.  You will be better off if you plan for an iterative deployment where the first release supports the bare essentials and subsequent releases layer in more functionality.  This is especially the case when your users are new to content management or have been using a limited toolset.  They will learn so much about their needs from the first release and have wonderful ideas for improving and extending the system.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There you have it.  Eight easy steps to select a CMS.</content>

    <title>Deane Barker: Editors Live in the Holes</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;A few days ago I read Deane Barker's excellent post &lt;a href="http://gadgetopia.com/post/7106"&gt;Editors Live in the Holes&lt;/a&gt; (go ahead and read the post and then come back) and I have been thinking about it ever since.  &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2006/10/the-6-million-dollar-wysiwyg-editor.html"&gt;I have had the same experience several times&lt;/a&gt; and it is a good reminder for developers to pay special attention to configuring and testing the rich text editor.   As Deane points out, it is too easy for developers to disregard "the holes" as a contributor problem, not a system problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get it right, the holes need to be jointly owned by the designers, developers, and content contributors.  &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2010/06/html-production-for-cms-implementations.html"&gt;Designers need to design for flexibility.&lt;/a&gt;  Developers need to do everything they can to make contributors successful.  But this raises something of a chicken and egg problem &amp;mdash; at least for new CMS implementations (as opposed to migrations).  In these projects, content entry typically occurs &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the system is considered complete.  This means that the designer and developer need to anticipate what rich text capabilities (formatting controls and the styles that control the display of rich text) the contributors will need.  This is particularly important in the ever-present "generic page" content type that is typically used for the many one-off (odd ball) pages that exist in any website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have found two good techniques to get around this problem.  First, it is good to test the rich text editor with a few of the more challenging one-off pages on the site.  Take a page with embedded images and objects (like perhaps a Google map) and formatting and try to reproduce it in the rich text editor.  Don't disable the rich text editor and edit the source.  That is cheating.  If it turns out you can't do it without pulling your hair out, you need to come up with a work around.  If it is a really important page, you might need to develop a special content type and/or presentation template that does some of the work.  If you find that there are too many challenging one-off pages to choose from, you might step back and consider enforcing more uniformity between pages.  Otherwise, you will probably not be getting all of the value (content reuse and manageability) out of a CMS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second technique is to build a "style guide" page and place it in some discrete area on the site.  The style guide page is a generic page that contains examples of all the stylings that are available to the contributor.  For example, every heading level, paragraphs, lists (ordered and unordered), tables, embedded images, etc.  The content contributor can visit this page to get an idea of what is possible and then open it in edit mode to see how the formatting was executed.  The process of building and reviewing the style guide page is a useful forum to get designers, developers, and contributors together to collaborate and align.  The fact that it is so tangible grounds everyone in the real capabilities of the platform.  The style guide page is also the first place to check updates or enhancements to styles after launch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, designers, developers, and contributors all want the site to be a success.  They can't just claim victory on their little piece ("the mockups were approved," "we got out of QA," or "I got my page to preview!").  Editors may live in the holes but everyone has to keep the holes clean.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>DAM Lifesavers?</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070202/ap_on_hi_te/digital911_2"&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; AP Story talks about an initiative to expand the 911 emergency program to accept videos and images.  It sounds like a great idea to put the ubiquity of cell phone cameras and mini video cameras to use.  Not only would the thousands of words expressed by a picture be effective in explaining the facts to the 911 operator, these images could be valuable evidence in legal trials that might arise from the emergency.  However, there is concern about the ability of the already extended 911 system to handle all the images and videos that might be reported.  In addition to uncertainty about adequate network bandwidth, 911 operators need the tools and processes to evaluate and catalog all the visual content that they receive - a perfect application for a Digital Asset Management solution. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The article does not name vendors that they are talking to but this would be a very cool case study.  The solution would have to be optimized for rapid-response usability and also records retention.  This kind of Digital Asset Management implementation might also push the state of the art in automated image interpretation (is this a fire or a hit and run? is the person in the picture a convicted felon?).</content>

    <title>Evaluating PHP Applications</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;While not quite as trendy and chic as &lt;a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/"&gt;Ruby on Rails&lt;/a&gt;, PHP is becoming widely accepted as an excellent platform for rapidly building web applications.  PHP runs fast and lean on a server and is easy to work in.  The PHP language supports object oriented programming and there are a number of frameworks that support patterns and functionality similar to some of the Java web application frameworks.  Even IBM, which invested millions of dollars developing and promoting Java, has integrated &lt;a href="http://contenthere.blogspot.com/2005/12/boston-php-user-group-meeting.html"&gt;PHP into their strategy&lt;/a&gt; and has made &lt;a href="http://searchwebservices.techtarget.com/originalContent/0,289142,sid26_gci1113808,00.html"&gt;some bets on the technology&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;a href="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=223"&gt;JSR 223&lt;/a&gt; is a new Java specification for writing Java objects so that they can be accessed from scripting languages like PHP.  Not surprisingly, many of the open source CMS are built in PHP.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One valid and accepted concern with PHP is security.  Over the years, there have been several rather serious exploits to PHP based applications.  Part of this is the technology itself and part of it is the style with which the applications may have been developed: fast and loose.  This problem is not unique to open source or PHP.  I have seen plenty of commercial software products with gaping holes.  For example, it used to be when you installed Interwoven TeamSite, you got a wide open proxy server that anyone could use.  If you were not careful, you could have half of China connecting through you to get to sites forbidden by the government.  This information wasn't published anywhere obvious (certainly not on the sales literature), I found out when the bandwidth consumption was going through the roof.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With open source, you have a better chance of finding about about these problems because they are publicly discussed within the community.  When selecting software, look at the security track record which you should have access to.  &lt;a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/blogs/2006/03/24/evaluating-php-applications/"&gt;This article by Harry Fuecks&lt;/a&gt; gives some useful pointers.  Once you have deployed the application, stay on the developer list (many projects have security specific lists) and subscribe to web security alerts.  With a little bit of attention, you can have piece of mind about the security of your application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Legacy reports available</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;If you read Content Here through RSS or just follow links to individual articles, you may have missed my new &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/publications"&gt;publications page&lt;/a&gt;.  In addition to listing some articles that I have published on other sites, the publications page now includes reports that I used to sell here at Content Here.  I have not kept these reports up to date with the technologies that they cover but the background information and selection strategies are still very relevant.  They are posted up on &lt;a href="http://www.scribd.com/sggottlieb"&gt;Scribd&lt;/a&gt; where they are free to read.  You may find the following reports particularly interesting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/77090148/Open-Source-Web-Content-Management-in-Java"&gt;Open Source Web Content Management in Java&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;This was Content Here's first report.  It reviewed 7 open source Java web content management systems (Alfresco, Apache Lenya, Daisy, Hippo, Jahia, Magnolia, and OpenCms).  While the individual product reviews are all out of date, the first 20 pages of the 173 page report contain useful information on the rise of open source content management and how evaluating open source platforms is different from commercial platforms&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/77087023/Open-Source-Web-Content-Management-in-Alfresco"&gt;Open Source Web Content Management in Alfresco&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is the Alfresco review from &lt;em&gt;Open Source Web Content Management in Java&lt;/em&gt; but updated to version 3.1 which was released in April of 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/77085653/Drupal-for-Publishers"&gt;Drupal for Publishers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is my most recent report.  It was published in 2009 and covers Drupal 6.10.  The interesting thing about this format is that it reviewed Drupal from the perspective of a publisher. The report is broken up into 3 sections: "what the publisher needs to know," "what the editor needs to know," and "what the developer needs to know."  I think that much of the general commentary is still very relevant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</content>

    <title>eZ components vs. Zend PHP Framework</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Maarten Manders writes a &lt;a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/blogs/2005/11/27/ez-components-%e2%80%93-new-competition-for-zend-php-framework/"&gt;nice analysis&lt;/a&gt; of two application frameworks being developed for PHP:  &lt;a href="http://ez.no/company/news/ez_components_1_0_beta1"&gt;eZ components&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.zend.com/collaboration/framework-overview.php"&gt;Zend PHP Framework&lt;/a&gt;.  While there is still not enough visibility for a thorough technical comparison, the article does a good job of summarizing the need for a good framework, guessing at the direction of these frameworks, describing  the buzz in the PHP community.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One interesting point is that the eZ components framework has the same web templating framework used in &lt;a href="http://ez.no/products/ez_publish_cms"&gt;eZ publish&lt;/a&gt; which is somewhat like the popular &lt;a href="http://smarty.php.net/"&gt;Smarty&lt;/a&gt; templating engine.  It sure would be  great not to have to use a different templating syntax with every CMS.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Alfresco on the iPhone</title>
    <content type='html'>Alfresco's &lt;a href="http://drquyong.com/myblog/"&gt;Dr. Yong Qu&lt;/a&gt; has a &lt;a href="http://drquyong.com/myblog/?p=18"&gt;short but interesting article about using Alfresco Web Scripts to build an iPhone friendly web client for Alfresco&lt;/a&gt;.  You can see a &lt;a href="http://www.drquyong.com/iAlfresco.html"&gt;demo here&lt;/a&gt; (turn down your speakers if you don't want to be cranking Kenny Loggins - you have been warned).  For a prototype, it nicely shows the power of Web Scripts but I wouldn't say that it captures the sexiness or efficiency of the iPhone UI.  I could see the core technology being very effective in the hands of an innovative designer.</content>

    <title>How frequently should we update our homepage?</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I recently overheard a discussion that should have gone extinct years ago:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"We try to update our home page twice a month … you know … to keep it fresh"&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my early CMS days I used to hear this type of thing all the time  when people were trying to justify the need for a CMS by quantifying how much they edit the site.  Even then, I thought the idea that people would be pleased by homepage "freshness" was a quaint little fantasy.  In the real world, nobody who matters cares about the fact that a home page has changed.  The absurdity of the idea is reflected in this Onion article &lt;a href="http://www.theonion.com/articles/man-cruises-by-william-h-macys-website-to-check-ou,19192/"&gt;"Man Cruises By William H. Macy's Website To Check Out The Latest"&lt;/a&gt; (hat tip to &lt;a href="http://gadgetopia.com/"&gt;Deane Barker&lt;/a&gt; for mentioning it at the &lt;a href="http://nowwhatconference.com/"&gt;Now What Conference&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is only one reason to change your home page and that is to &lt;strong&gt;make it better&lt;/strong&gt;. What do I mean by better?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h3&gt;More Current&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;p&gt;Obviously, you don't want to have any outdated information on the homepage.  If you were promoting an event, you want to replace that promotion when the event has passed. You may even want to replace it when it is too late for an attendee to consider going. If you have a new product that you want to push, that product should get top billing.  If you have changed the way you describe your organization, that change needs to be reflected in the language on the home page.  Being current is keeping up with with your content marketing strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h3&gt;More Compelling&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;p&gt;As I have said before, &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2011/09/why-you-should-do-your-homepage-wireframe-last.html"&gt;the only reason why someone visits your home page is because he does not know where to go&lt;/a&gt;.  More intentional visits will come from deep links from search engines and other sites.  Use this indecision to your advantage by driving the visitor to your goals.  What content is the most compelling?  You will never know until you test and that is where analytics and multivariate testing comes in.  By the way, never do simple A/B testing.  &lt;a href="http://stevehanov.ca/blog/index.php?id=132"&gt;Always use an "epsilon-greedy" approach that allows the more effective option to automatically bubble to the top&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The simple rule is to &lt;em&gt;never change content unless you have something better to show&lt;/em&gt;.  But just because the rule is simple, it doesn't mean it is easy to practice.  To follow the rule, you need to be producing current content that is in line with what your organization is doing; and you need to be hyper-aware of how your content is performing so you can continually improve it.  Capriciously changing for the sake of change may make you feel productive and dynamic, but it isn't doing your organization any good.  Never changing your home page is not a good thing either.  It is a symptom of a stagnant organization and that is not something that you fix by regularly scheduled homepage changes.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Enterprise Content Management- Open Source Options to Support Your
Strategic Future</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://www.ati4it.com"&gt;ATI&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://ez.no"&gt;eZ systems&lt;/a&gt; are hosting an introduction to open source content management and &lt;a href="http://ez.no/products/ez_publish"&gt;eZ publish&lt;/a&gt; on October 20th in the Washington DC area (Tysons Corner for you beltway folks).  &lt;a href="http://www.ati4it.com/conference/index.html"&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; are the details.  Earlier in the summer, I &lt;a href="http://contenthere.blogspot.com/2006/05/will-i-see-you-in-dc.html"&gt;presented&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://contenthere.blogspot.com/2006/07/my-washington-gilbane-slides.html"&gt;(slides)&lt;/a&gt; with one of ATI's clients: Page Glennie from the Department of the Navy.  Mr. Glennie had a great case study about how they consolidated a bunch of Navy acquisition web sites using eZ publish and saved a boat load of money.</content>

    <title>GSA: Meta-data not essential for search</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;A participant on the  &lt;a href="http://www.aiim.org/standards.asp?ID=29284"&gt;iECM&lt;/a&gt; mailing list recently posted a link to an &lt;a href="http://marinemetadata.org/guides/metadatabasics/gsametadata"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; about the &lt;a href="http://www.gsa.gov"&gt;GSA&lt;/a&gt; concluding that metadata is not essential.  The study, based largely on information from industry experts, found that search technology is good enough that full text indexing is sufficient and no manual human intervention is necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am sure that my taxonomist friends are working up a worthy rebuttal.  But lets just consider the proposition that, at least in the case of normal textual information like this blog entry, manual keyword assignment is not essential.  Of course, as the article states, this does not apply to graphical content or numerical data which cannot be parsed and into words that would match a textual search query.  But in the case of text, is it reasonable to assume that the author will, in the course of writing, wind up using words that a prospective searcher will search for? There is the issue of synonyms and word choice, and word stems but that can be accounted for in a good search algorithm (When the query request contains "blog" also look for "web log," and "journal".  When the query request is "running," look for "run").  Google seems to do a good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the commercial search engines all ignore keyword tagging because it is so often abused.  I am reminded of the &lt;a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/"&gt;Extreme Programming&lt;/a&gt; philosophy about commenting your code (at least at the method level).  The code itself should be clear about what it does without explanation by comments.  The need for comments is a symptom of overly complex and, therefore, hard to maintain code.   I re-read this post and it contains every keyword that I would have used to classify it (search, query, metadata, GSA).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be honest, most clients I have worked with have either neglected or abused keywords.  Either don't understand the value of keywords and don't bother, or they try to game the system so that their content gets put in visible places (yes, this even happens on corporate intranets).  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what if we said to our authors what the commercial search engines tell us:   "Don't worry about meta-data tagging, just write good content and we will bring you the right readers."  Where would we be?  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Metadata is not just keywords.  Look at the &lt;i&gt;basic&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href="http://catalog.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&amp;amp;PAGE=First"&gt;Library of Congress search page&lt;/a&gt;.  See how you can search on different metadata fields to get what you want?  Metadata also helps content reuse.  For example, if the title, summary, author, and other attributes of content are stored in structured way, they can be shown on pages that list many content assets, not just the detail page.   A 50 word summary is more valuable than the first 50 words of a 10,000 word document (unless the author is especially good at getting to his point.  I noticed that in this entry I lead in talking about iECM which this post has nothing to do with).   Structuring a portion of content also helps with things like sorting (as in by date, author, etc.). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metadata is what content management &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt;.  To quote a recent &lt;a href="http://www.cmswatch.com/Feature/137-The-Great-Divide"&gt;CMS Watch article&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="http://www.marklogic.com/"&gt;MarkLogic&lt;/a&gt; CEO &lt;a href="http://marklogic.blogspot.com/"&gt;Dave Kellog&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;That is, while ECM tracks and manages a lot of information about the content, it actually does relatively little to help get inside content. Despite its middle name, ECM today isn't really about content. It's about metadata.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Without metadata, an ECM is just a file system with versioning. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, it looks like authors are not off the hook.  Interestingly, in the library world, the people who write the metadata are different from the people that write the content.  Unfortunately this is too costly for most corporate environments that casually create and use content and don't have the budget for a full time librarian staff.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>One size fits none</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;CMS Watch recently &lt;a href="http://www.cmswatch.com/Trends/676-One-CMS,-or-two"&gt;referenced&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href="http://www.econtentmag.com/Articles/ArticlePrint.aspx?ArticleID=15486&amp;CategoryID=12"&gt;Martin White's EContent Article&lt;/a&gt; further disproving the &lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;one size fits all&lt;/span&gt; vision for content management.  It seems the pragmatic "best of breed" approach has beaten the industry sanctioned, monolithic ECM message in almost Gandhi-like fashion ("First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win.") and no one really believes that one CMS implementation can serve everyone.  Even if a single CMS product could do it all, customizations and configurations to benefit one group would spoil it for other groups trying to do different things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So where is the discussion going to go?  I think the interesting problems are: a) how to optimize a technology (and process) to solve a finite set of business problems really well; and b) how to share content across a heterogeneous content environment.  These are harder, more interesting, problems.  Problems that are solved with continuous, incremental improvement and focus on the user - not big bang silver bullets that are more likely to blow up in your face than hit a target.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Does &amp;quot;Intranet&amp;quot; Need a New Name?</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;James Robertson has an excellent post, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.steptwo.com.au/columntwo/future-principle-its-more-than-the-intranet/"&gt;Future principle: it’s more than the intranet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, where he summarizes a movement to replace the term "intranet" with a word that reflects what an intranet could be.  To quote:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are some that would like to dump the “intranet” name, as it’s associated with the “old” vision of intranets as a publishing platform, a dumping group for documents, and a place for the CEO to post his thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This narrow vision of the intranet must certainly die. In the process, intranet teams need to go from being custodians of an internal website, to facilitators for business improvements. In many ways, the word “intranet” has too much baggage, and is an anchor for much-needed changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;I agree that many people hear the word intranet and immediately think "dumping ground" but one does wonder if companies will not sully the next name by their continued failure to execute on the vision.  The term "intranet" is actually pretty good and should be able to ride on the coat tails of the internet.  The name "internet" wasn't brought down by failures like GeoCities because there is so much innovation happening; and &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2010/01/community-development.html"&gt;failure is a necessary by-product of innovation&lt;/a&gt;.  The difference is that failure kills most corporate intranets.  Many intranets are big waterfall I.T. projects that are "complete" after launch.  There is no time or budget left to learn from mistakes and adjust &amp;mdash; the equivalent of a failed internet start-up but without the decency of shutting the servers down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don't expect companies will improve their execution of intranet projects until they start to change the way they build, launch, and manage internal products.  The companies that are ahead of the curve should give their intranet an internal name to make users expect and work for more than the status quo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BTW, I have a great replacement for the term "intranet" but I am not going to tell anyone because, sooner or later, it will be ruined by some comatose intranet initiative looking for some easy re-branding. :P&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Open Core</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;In case you have not been following the open source blogosphere, there is an interesting discussion happening around a new term called "open core."  Open core describes the strategy of building a business on selling commercially licensed software with open source licensed components or companion products.  Open core companies tend to use third party open source components and distribute some of their own components (not the complete solution) under an open source license (typically the GPL because that is the most protective).  &lt;a href="http://blogs.the451group.com/opensource/2009/07/08/what-is-open-core-licensing-and-what-isnt/"&gt;Matthew Aslett has a nice breakdown of what is and what isn't open core&lt;/a&gt;; although I disagree that the subscription model &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; open core when the vendor requires a subscription fee to &lt;em&gt;use the software&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This strategy is in contrast to software companies that primarily offer a free open source version of their product and make their revenue entirely from support services (such as technical support, maintenance, training, implementation).  &lt;a href="http://ez.no"&gt;eZ Publish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.onehippo.org/index.html"&gt;Hippo&lt;/a&gt; are pretty good examples of pure open source companies.  &lt;a href="http://alampitt.typepad.com/lampitt_or_leave_it/2008/08/open-core-licen.html"&gt;The term "open core" was coined by Andrew Lampitt&lt;/a&gt; and all the chatter around it shows how much it is needed.  The market needed something to distinguish the two types of companies: open source and open core.  &lt;a href="http://www.nicholasgoodman.com/bt/blog/2009/10/13/what-if-hot-dog-vendors-sold-you-power-tools/"&gt;Nicholas Goodman makes the observation that it doesn't make sense for a company that only sells proprietary software to call itself an open source software company&lt;/a&gt;.  Now each type of company gets its own descriptive classification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the "household name" open source software companies follow the open core model: Alfresco, SugarCRM, Pentaho, Magnolia... to name a few.  The viability of the open source version varies from company to company.  Magnolia Community, for example, is full featured enough for most typical uses and is as well maintained as the Enterprise Edition.  In other cases, the Community Edition is deliberately hobbled to encourage an up-sell.  In other cases, the licensing is just confusing.  For example, Alfresco's Enterprise Edition is officially GPL licensed but you need to pay an annual subscription fee to use the copy that was compiled and tested by Alfresco, Inc. &amp;mdash; and they won't sell you support or allow their partners help you unless you are using the version they compiled.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;From a market perspective, the "open" companies that were established with venture capital tend to be open core.  This makes sense because venture capitalists make big investments and are looking for big returns &amp;mdash; bigger than what a pure services company can hope for.  To get VC money, a start-up would have to position itself as a software company that needed to build product with scalable sales and decent margins downstream.  Services companies don't work that way.  A services company can make money from day one but shouldn't expect hockey stick growth and low variable costs.  A successful service-based software company may also need huge market penetration to create a big enough market to sell services into.  It is a matter of multiples.  If for every 100 users you get 1 paying customer, you better have millions of users.  Many software categories do not have that market potential.  For every 1 CRM instance, a large company will probably have 3 CMS instances, 30 database instances, 60 web server instances, and 100 operating system instances.  This is why RedHat can be more open to unpaid use than SugarCRM.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, what does this all mean to the buyer?  As I mentioned in the &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/products-page/open-source-content-management-in-java/open-source-content-management-in-java"&gt;Open Source Web Content Management in Java Report&lt;/a&gt;, it is important to understand the vendor's business model to judge the viability of the company and the total cost of the software that you will bear.  Differentiating between open source and open core will add some clarity to a confusing marketplace with complicated licensing models.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>POC, Prototype, or Pilot? When and Why</title>
    <content type='html'>I frequently hear the terms "Proof of Concept" (POC), "Prototype", and "Pilot" used interchangeably. This is unfortunate because they mean different things and serve very different functions. In fact, I think that if you want to successfully implement technology, you should be doing all three. The good news is that, at least to some level, you probably are. But the extent to which you are benefiting from POCs, prototypes, and pilots depends on the level of consciousness and deliberateness you practice. By "deliberateness," I mean having an understanding of purpose. I use "consciousness" to say that you pay attention to the process and are aware of the results. More on that later.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Proof of Concept&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Proof of Concept (POC) is a small exercise to test a discrete design idea or assumption. Software developers tend to do POCs instinctively when they experiment with technology. An example of a POC is testing whether one technology talks to another. To be deliberate, a POC should clearly state what it is to be proven and to what degree. For example, it may not be enough that a message can be transfered from system A to system B if the complete solution calls a specific level of performance and reliability. You may need to test under certain conditions. POC's often take the outward form of a simple "Hello World" but that may not be enough if the system needs to support an extended character set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of a POC need to be measurable so that they can be fed into the decision making process. Your decision should be based on thresholds like a performance level that is acceptable. Thats the consciousness part. It may not be enough to for someone to just say "yeah, we tested that and it works." You want the results of the test to see how or how well it works. A POC may involve secondary research if you trust the source. Maybe another group tested the same concept. If their process was as rigorous as yours, you may be able to use their results. There are also user interface POCs that explore the usability of a specific UI control or visual metaphor. These need to be designed and tested with the same degree of thoroughness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Prototype&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Prototype is a more fleshed out system that tries to simulate the full system or at least a material part of it. Prototypes are used to test the viability or usefulness of a system or subsystem. You plunk an intended user of the projected system in front of the prototype and he/she/it (the user might be another system) should be able to visualize the experience of using the complete system. The completeness of the prototype depends on what you are testing. For example, you might want to build a three dimensional physical model to test an innovative new shape for a telephone handset. If there is question as to whether the person can hear a speaker which has been designed in an unconventional place, the prototype may need a speaker. Or possibly, you could do a POC of just holding a speaker in that position and testing audibility in different conditions. Pretty much all manufactured goods go through a prototyping process because that is usually the best way to figure out the feasibility and cost of manufacturing the product. For software, prototypes can have varying degrees of fidelity from visual mockups to working software.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You need to be deliberate in defining what you hope to gain through building the prototype and the minimal level of completeness that it would take to get that information. There is some disagreement as to whether a prototype should be constructed to be thrown away or whether it should be the initial building blocks of the complete system. I think it depends on a number of things. You should invest as little as possible in the prototype otherwise the sunk costs might make you stick with a bad idea longer than you should. If that means building it out of a technology which is agile to use but unsuitable for full scale deployment, then use the easy technology with the expectation of throwing it away. However, if you are dead sure on the core idea and you just want to prototype different variations, it may be more practical to build the core technology framework and then build prototypes off of that.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you go through the hassle and expense of building a prototype, use it. Get it in front of your intended audience and listen to what they say. Don't just listen. &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Hear&lt;/span&gt; them. If you are not doing to do that, don't call it a prototype. Call it an iteration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Pilot&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Pilot uses the full production system and tests it against a subset of the general intended audience. The reason for doing a pilot is to get a better understanding of how the product will be used in the field and to refine the product. Maybe there are some open ended questions about scalability that only a live audience using the product can answer. If you are doing a Pilot (or Beta) for a reason other than to build hype, make sure that you target the right group of people and you are prepared to collect the right metrics. You may consider prepping your pilot group to evaluate the full breadth of the application and give them channels to provide feedback. If there are particular areas of the application that you really want to test, call attention to them. Determine what kind of quantitative metrics you will be collecting and have the tools and time to analyze them. If you are going to do a Pilot you should be prepared to act on the information that you collect and fold refinements into a general release. You should probably have a process to prioritize enhancements ideas and a threshold for determine what enhancements to implement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;POCs, Prototypes, and Pilots are all important tactics in implementing technology. However, just using the words is not enough. You need to engage in these activities deliberately and methodically for them to be of any value. And you will never realize that value unless you consciously record the results and turn this data into usable, actionable information.</content>

    <title>Have you modeled your content effectively?</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;This is the second installment of a &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2011/03/what-is-a-content-management-assessment.html"&gt;series of articles on content management assessments&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly all content management systems have flexible repositories that allow you to control how content is structured.  This is important because every organization's content is different just like every website is different.  But this flexibility can also be a liability because it creates opportunity for bad design as well as good design.  Content can be under-structured, over-structured, or wrongly structured.  Asking the right questions will help you assess how effective your content was modeled.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Do your contributors spend a lot of time formatting content?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        If your content contributors spend a lot of time formatting, it may mean that your content is not structured enough.  Look out for "formatting patterns" where a content contributor repeats a format pattern to give the illusion of structure.  For example, if the by-line and date-lines of articles are stored in the main body and distinguished by a particular font treatment, those should probably be fielded elements.  The risk of letting this go is that it reduces flexibility.  The only way to change how a by-line looks is to go into each article and change the formatting.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Do your content contributors feel like data the entry aspect is overshadowing the creative process?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        While structure is generally a good thing, too much can be stifling to the overall goal of content: communication. Most content contributors need a blank palette to rearrange and massage information until it tells the right story.  Filling out endless form fields breaks that flow and never allows the creative process to take root.  A good example is forcing a user to enter the body of a semi-structured content asset into a series of paragraph fields rather than one rich text field.  A series of paragraph fields makes it hard for the author to re-arrange content and split and merge paragraphs.  A good clue that your content entry interface is overly cumbersome is if content contributors wait until the very end of the editorial process to enter content into the CMS.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Do you frequently find yourself wishing for a global (as in site-wide) search and replace?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        On one CMS selection, I received a requirement for a global search and replace.  The reason for this requirement was a recent episode where the organization's phone number changed and they needed to update every press release because the contact number was embedded in the body field below the rest of the article.  Not everything that a visitor sees on the page has to be entered by a content contributor.  Some of the page can be hard-coded into display templates.  Other parts of the page can be managed as global content components.  In this case, it would have been better to embed the phone number in the press release display template below the body copy.  If the phone number was likely to change frequently, a global content component would allow a content contributor to edit this information in one place and without the assistance of a template developer.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Do content contributors find themselves duplicating the same text over and over again?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        A content management system is not doing its job if contributors are not effectively reusing content.  The classic example is an article list and detail page.  If content is structured properly, the article headline exists in only one place: in the article.  The list page queries the articles and lists their headlines.  If the headline exists in two places, it needs to managed in two places.  Now, this is an obvious example and it is shown in nearly every CMS demo that I have seen.  A less obvious example is a promotional element &amp;mdash; some block of display that promotes some messaging or a product.  You want to manage those as components that can be re-used in different places on the site.  I call this &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2010/07/keeping-your-content-dry.html"&gt;keeping your content DRY&lt;/a&gt;.  With better reuse, you can manage less content and still support the same visitor experience.  The downside to reuse is that it makes specialization hard, you can't change the wording in one place without it affecting all other occurrences of that content.  You need to make decisions about whether specializing a piece of content is worth the additional management overhead.   &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Do content contributors overload or misuse content attributes?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        A hallmark of an un-maintained content management solution is when content contributors start to get creative and misuse content elements to achieve the behavior that they want.  &lt;a href="http://www.gadgetopia.com/post/6853"&gt;Deane Barker has an excellent presentation on this called "Just Put That in the Zip Code Field"&lt;/a&gt;.  This warning sign means that the requirements for the solution have changed but the solution has not adapted.  It is a big issue when your content contributors care more about the website more than the support team.  On the plus side, this means that you have established ownership over the content.  On the negative side, the organization as a whole is either unwilling or incapable of supporting that ownership.  If you see these signs, you need to get in gear and honor content contributors' commitment by taking better care of the solution.&lt;br/&gt;        &lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news is that most content management systems will allow you to correct content modeling inefficiencies &amp;mdash; but with certain limitations. First, content management systems tend to have &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2009/06/pages-and-objects.html"&gt;different strategies for managing content: page based or object based&lt;/a&gt; and the extent of available data types varies from product to product (again, check out &lt;a href="http://www.gadgetopia.com/post/6853"&gt;Deane's presentation&lt;/a&gt;).  Second, going from more structure to less is easier than going from less structure to more.  You can automatically concatenate multiple fields into one; it is harder to arbitrarily split large unstructured elements into multiple structured elements.  Third, some content management systems have better utilities for doing bulk content transformations than others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a quick little exercise, try to prototype and alternative content model and ask your content contributors to give feedback.  They may feel like they have a whole new lease on their content.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Alfresco Book Review</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I imagine it was a great challenge to write the first book on the new &lt;a href="http://www.alfresco.com"&gt;Alfresco&lt;/a&gt; open source enterprise content management system.  Enterprise content management is a deliberately broad field with a diverse audience of stakeholders.  Alfresco is a powerful but new and rapidly evolving product with, as one might expect, thin documentation.  I am happy that &lt;a href="http://www.packtpub.com/author_view_profile/id/116"&gt;Munwar Shariff&lt;/a&gt; undertook this challenge to write &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAlfresco-Enterprise-Content-Management-Implementation%2Fdp%2F1904811116%2Fsr%3D8-1%2Fqid%3D1172288713%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks&amp;tag=contenthere-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Alfresco Enterprise Content Management Implementation&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The target audience of the book appears to be a technical person who is evaluating and getting started with Alfresco.  There is good information about the architectural principles and the range of uses for the product.  There are also some instructions and recommendations for installing the product.  As I recommended in my &lt;a href="http://contenthere.blogspot.com/2005/08/plone-live-review.html"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; of Munwars book Plone book (&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0976553406?tag=contenthere-20&amp;camp=14573&amp;creative=327641&amp;linkCode=as1&amp;creativeASIN=0976553406&amp;adid=0K8BZBZZE6EQ6XZ0S2EP&amp;"&gt;Plone Live&lt;/a&gt;), I would consider removing the installation section because that is one of the things that is well covered in the Alfresco documentation.  However, the recommendations around the configuration options are helpful.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, it may have been a little ambitious to cover strategies for initiating and managing an Enterprise Content Management project.  That is the topic of several  other books on content management (Definitely read &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FContent-Management-Bible-Bob-Boiko%2Fdp%2F0764573713%2Fsr%3D8-1%2Fqid%3D1172289530%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks&amp;tag=contenthere-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325"&gt;The Content Management Bible&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=contenthere-20&amp;amp;l=ur2&amp;amp;o=1" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /&gt; by Bob Boiko) and software development.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The core strength of this book is as an aid to explore the functionality of the Alfresco web client and to learn how to configure and extend it.  As with most Java applications, most of Alfresco's behavior is managed through a series of XML files.  The examples of how to manipulate these files in the book and as part of an accompanying download are very good.  And when you go through these exercises and open up the files you can't help but notice other settings that might be useful to modify as well. I think it would be helpful to discuss the underlying technologies that support the Alfresco platform and also tips for tuning the software to meet the performance and availability demands of an actively used implementation. But those topics might be more appropriate for an advanced book.  For an Alfresco beginner (and there are a lot of people who fit that description out there), this book is a great introduction.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Deployment Timing for a Global Business</title>
    <content type='html'>Global businesses operate on a 24 hour workday. No matter what time it is, somebody is trying to get something done - whether it be a customer trying to interact with you or it could be an employee trying to do her job. This can make system maintenance (such as deploying new website functionality or upgrading some business application) a challenge. Of course, we do our best to minimize or eliminate the amount of downtime a deployment causes. In fact, my team regularly deploys new code across our applications several times day (yay, automation!). However, there are also deployments that you try to schedule outside of peak load. Perhaps, there will be brief periods when the system is unavailable or in an awkward transitional state. So the question is, when do you do these deployments? We look at three factors:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;The first thing we look at is the business calendar to make sure we are aware of any events that might drive traffic. For us, this could be a marketing campaign or, for our business applications, it could a peak in workload (like a deadline). It's a good idea to have a mailing list of primary users and announce upgrade plans to them. They will tell you if there is an issue with your schedule.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;The second thing we look at is daily load patterns. All of the systems that I manage are running on Amazon Web Services using Elastic Load Balancers so my favorite tool for this is a CloudWatch ELB Request Count report. That shows nice regular daily spikes of traffic to your sites.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;The third, and possibly most important, thing we look at is our own work patterns. While the load patterns may tell you to do your deployments at 3AM, &lt;strong&gt;don't do it&lt;/strong&gt;. You could be tired and careless at that time of night. Plus, you will probably want to go to bed right after and that would be the worst time to be sleeping. Configuration errors usually take a little while to surface.  You don't want to wake up the next morning to find an inbox full of frustrated users who lost large chunks of productivity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using this logic, we typically find our best upgrade windows to be at unexpected times like 2PM Eastern on a Wednesday. During this time: most of Asia is sleeping; Europe is enjoying dinner; and most of the Americas is having lunch or in a post-meal coma. At this time, we have our full team on hand for testing and remediation if anything goes wrong. And we get to sleep well that night knowing if anything were to go wrong, it would have done so hours ago.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One caveat: this strategy probably won't work for you if you are delivering a high traffic service with a ridiculously stringent SLA. But if that is your business, you should probably have an around-the-clock, 3-shift dev-ops staff and lots of people planning and managing deployments.</content>

    <title>Conference Schedule 09</title>
    <content type='html'>This year I am trying to reduce my travel by limiting the number of conferences that I attend.  But there are a couple that I can't miss.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;J. Boye, Philadelphia, May 5-7&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.jboye.com/conferences/philadelphia09/"&gt;The jboye09 conference in Philly (May 5-7)&lt;/a&gt; looks like it is taking shape nicely.  Many of the &lt;a href="http://www.jboye.com/conferences/philadelphia09/speakers/"&gt;speakers from J. Boye's conference in Denmark are lined up&lt;/a&gt;. There are tracks on Strategy &amp; Governance, Intranets, Web Content Management, SharePoint, User Experience, and E-Health.  As I have said &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2007/09/cmf2007-content-camp.html"&gt;before&lt;/a&gt;, this is an exceptional conference and I am very excited to participate without having to cross the Atlantic.  What really distinguishes J. Boye from other conferences is the social aspect. Everyone attends the nightly events so you have a chance to network with peers and experts in your field.  The J. Boye team has a knack for learning your interests and connecting you with the people you should meet. If you want to hang out with the most knowledgeable people in the industry, this is your conference.  The &lt;strong&gt;discount code "sgphilly" gets you 15% off&lt;/strong&gt; when you &lt;a href="http://www.jboye.com/conferences/philadelphia09/sign_up"&gt;register&lt;/a&gt;.  If you work for a non-profit, you may be able to do even better by emailing J. Boye at &lt;a href="mailto:info@jboye.com"&gt;info@jboye.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gilbane, San Francisco, June 2-4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Last December, I had a great time teaching a &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2008/11/cms-selection-workshop.html"&gt;workshop on Selecting a Web Content Management System&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="http://gilbaneboston.com/08/"&gt;Gilbane Conference in Boston&lt;/a&gt;.  I will be teaching the same &lt;a href="http://gilbanesf.com/workshops.html"&gt;selection workshop (improved of course) in San Francisco in June&lt;/a&gt;.  The Gilbane conference program always has an impressive list of industry leaders and the vendor exhibition area is a great place to see product demos. &lt;a href="http://gilbanesf.com/registration_information.html"&gt;Register&lt;/a&gt; before April 28th for a $200 discount off admission. The conference plus package, which includes the pre-conference tutorials, comes with a free iPod Touch (just don't be listening to it during my session!).  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the time saved by a lighter conference schedule, I plan to do more reading and &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net"&gt;writing&lt;/a&gt;.  I have some aggressive publishing goals this year. My consulting work &lt;a href="http://www.tripit.com/people/sggottlieb"&gt;still has me on the road a lot&lt;/a&gt; so I might be in a city near you over the course of the year.  I also hope to stay connected digitally using the many &lt;a href="http://friendfeed.com/sggottlieb"&gt;social networking sites that I participate in&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Perforce Git Fusion</title>
    <content type='html'>I recently got an announcement for Perforce about their &lt;a href="http://www.perforce.com/company/press-room/perforce-git-fusion" title="Git Fusion"&gt;new Git Fusion product&lt;/a&gt;.  I never really loved Perforce as a source code management system (I probably didn't used it long enough to get used to it like I did with StarTeam, SVN, and Git); but I love how the company is building new products on top of the Perforce foundation.  This summer I caught a demo of their web content management product &lt;a href="http://www.perforce.com/products/chronicle" title="Perforce Chronicle"&gt;Perforce Chronicle&lt;/a&gt; and was impressed.  You don't normally see sophisticated versioning and staging functionality like that in a CMS in that price point. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nice work Perforce!</content>

    <title>New Plone Book: PloneLive</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;There is a new Plone Book available: &lt;a href="http://plonelive.com/"&gt;PloneLive 1.0&lt;/a&gt; by Michel Pelletier and Munwar Shariff.  What makes PloneLive really interesting is that it is a LiveBook that is constantly being updated.  You can buy it print on demand for $44.95 from &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; or a year's subscription for $29.95.  The &lt;a href="http://plonelive.com"&gt;PloneLive Site&lt;/a&gt; also has a blog and other content.  The authors and &lt;a href="http://www.sourcebeat.com/"&gt;SourceBeat&lt;/a&gt; (the publisher) make a good point that traditional publishing mechanisms may not be able to keep pace with rapidly changing open source projects and dynamic books are the best way to document.  Unlike a project wiki, the authors are compensated for their content.   It will be interesting to see if this publishing model takes hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the authors made a bad choice in selecting a sample chapter so it is difficult to tell if the book is any good.  The sample chapter just superficially covers what a content management system is, what Python is, and how to install Plone. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For an excellent book on Plone, check out &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;tag=contenthere-20&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;path=tg/detail/-/1590593294/qid=1118684966/sr=8-1/ref=pd_csp_1?v=glance%26s=books%26n=507846"&gt;The Definitive Guide to Plone&lt;/a&gt; by Andy McKay.  Almost the entire book is available on &lt;a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/plone-docs"&gt;SourceForge&lt;/a&gt; but I would not do without my paper copy.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>CM Professionals New Member Rates Going Up</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;The new member membership fee for &lt;a href="http://www.cmprofessionals.org"&gt;CM Professionals&lt;/a&gt; is increasing from $50 to $100 on March 31st.  While this represents a 100% increase, it is still rediculously cheap for all the value you get.  For those of you who are unfamiliar with CM Professionals, it is membership organization for content management practitioners and experts.  The community is free of corporate bias and it is an excellent resource for asking questions and networking.  Most of the luminaries in the field that I know of are already members.  &lt;a href="http://www.cmprofessionals.org/membership/why_join/"&gt;You should be too&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have been considering joining.  Now is the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the shameless plug.  Now onto our regular programming.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Web 2.0 Politics</title>
    <content type='html'>My colleague, John Eckman, has an &lt;a href="http://www.openparenthesis.org/2006/10/25/are-you-now-or-have-you-ever-been-a-member-of-web-20/"&gt;excellent post&lt;/a&gt; about a recent digital fracas on what it means to be a Web 2.0 company.  John summarizes a blogument between &lt;a href="http://www.lessig.org/blog/"&gt;Lawrence Lessig&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.nicholasgcarr.com/"&gt;Nick Carr&lt;/a&gt;.  While the discussion falls short of accusations of fascism, there is a considerable amount of comparison to Maoist philosophy.   Fun reading for those of us who appreciate a good intellectual dust-up.</content>

    <title>Duh - I Get it Now</title>
    <content type='html'>I can't remember if I knew this before but someone recently mentioned that the &lt;a href="http://www.eclipse.org"&gt;Eclipse project&lt;/a&gt; was named as a dig on &lt;a href="http://www.sun.com/"&gt;Sun Microsystems&lt;/a&gt;.  Get it?  Sun, Eclipse?  I always questioned Sun's lack of involvement in Eclipse.  I don't know if it was only the Eclipse project itself but I would say that the Eclipse supporting companies (like &lt;a href="http://www.ibm.com/"&gt;IBM&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.oracle.com/"&gt;Oracle&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.borland.com/"&gt;Borland&lt;/a&gt;) are &lt;em&gt;eclipsing&lt;/em&gt; Sun in their Java-oriented businesses.  Hostility aside, this is a good example of using an open source project as an opportunity for companies to collaborate and cooperatively force market change.  Other examples include the many open source projects that were established as reference implementations to push forward a standard. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other hostile open source project names:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://github.com/KirinDave/fuzed/tree/master"&gt;Fuzed&lt;/a&gt; is for F-U Zed.  Zed is the guy who wrote &lt;a href="http://mongrel.rubyforge.org/"&gt;Mongrel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.gnu.org/"&gt;GNU&lt;/a&gt; stands for GNU's Not Unix.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any others?</content>

    <title>The Placeholder Application Controller Pattern</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;One of the main benefits of using a coupled (&lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2007/06/cms-deployment-patterns.html"&gt;aka "frying"&lt;/a&gt;) web content management system (WCMS) is that you get a web application development framework with which to build dynamic content-driven applications.  Like nearly all modern web application development frameworks, a coupled CMS provides an implementation of the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern.  For the less technical reader, the MVC pattern is used in just about all software that provides a user interface.  The essence is that the model (the data), the view (how the information is presented and interacted with), and the controller (the business logic of the application) are separate concerns and keeping them separate makes the software more maintainable.  I will let &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93View%E2%80%93Controller"&gt;Wikipedia provide a further explanation of MVC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MVC implementation that comes with a typical WCMS is less flexible than a generic, all purpose web application framework.  Your WCMS delivery tier makes a lot of assumptions because it knows that you are primarily trying to publish semi-structured content to some form of document format &amp;mdash; probably an HTML page, but possibly some XML-based syndication format.  Your WCMS knows roughly what your model looks like (it is a semi-structured content item from the repository that has only the data types that the repository supports); it has certain way of interpreting URLS; and the output is designed to be cached for rapid page loads.  Those assumptions are handy because they make less work for the developer.  In fact, most of the work on a typical WCMS implementation is done in the templates.  There is hardly any work done in the model or controller logic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there are times when the assumptions of the CMS are broken.  Anyone who has implemented a relatively sophisticated website on a CMS has had the experience of either overloading or working around the MVC pattern that comes with the CMS.  The approach that I want to talk about here is what I call the PAC (Placeholder Application Controller) pattern.  In a nutshell, this pattern de-emphasizes the roles of the model and controller and overloads the view (template) to support logic for a mini-application.  The content item goes from being the model to a placeholder on the website.  The controller is used more like a switchboard to dial up the right template.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is a common example.  Let's say that you are building a web site for an insurance company.  Most of the pages on the site are pretty much static.  But there is one page that has a calculator where a visitor enters in some information about what he wants to insure and gets back a recommended coverage amount and estimated premiums.  It would be pretty silly to try to manage all the data that drives the coverage calculator as content in the CMS.  Instead, you would probably want to write the calculator in client-side Javascript, copy it into a presentation template and then assign that presentation template to a blank content page with the title "Coverage Calculator."  The Coverage Calculator page in the content repository is really just a placeholder that gives your Javascript application a URL on the site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To a lesser extent, home pages often implement the PAC pattern.  In this case, the home page might be a simple empty placeholder page that is assigned a powerful template that queries and features content from across the site.  When the controller grabs the template and model, it may only think that it is rendering the content that is managed in the home page asset.  Little does the controller know, the template is going to take over and start to act like a controller &amp;mdash; grabbing other models and applying other templates to them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Placeholder Application Controller is one of those patterns that, once you think about it, you realize you use it all the time.  It is convenient and practical but be careful with it because it is easy to get carried away.  The main risk of the PAC pattern is that you are going against the grain of the WCMS architecture.  Templates are supposed to be for formatting only.  You may be pushing the templating language a little farther than it was intended to go and your code may become unmanageable.  You also may be short-circuiting the security controls provided by the controller.  Some WCMS platforms have a pluggable architecture that allows 3rd party modules (programmed in something other than the template language) to step in and play the roles of model, view, and controller.  This helps keep the architecture cleaner but there will always be some limitations on how these modules are allowed to work.  After a certain point, you will be better off going with a generic web application framework that affords you more flexibility and just use the WCMS to publish content into your custom web application.  But that is a much larger undertaking.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Hot Lots</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;When I start working with an established software development team, my favorite tool for understanding their process is a "hot lot." Hot lot is a manufacturing term where an order is expedited by being allowed to jump the queue. Hot lots are closely watched for progress and potential delays. In the world of software development, a hot lot can be a feature request that goes through a process of design, implementation, testing, enablement (documentation), release, promotion, and evaluation. A hot lot should accelerate the process by adjusting priorities but it should not circumvent the process by breaking rules or cutting corners. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By prioritizing a feature and watching it go through the process at top speed, you can learn many things. For example, you can learn...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whether the process is even responsive enough to accept a hot lot. Sometimes engineering is tied to rigid roadmaps and nothing, no matter how important, can jump the line. This is concerning if those roadmaps stretch out beyond the opportunities you can reliably anticipate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whether there even is a defined process. Is there a mechanism for ensuring all of the tasks (qa, documentation, deployment, etc.) are completed? Or maybe there is a process but nobody follows it. If there is no practiced process, you can't trust the integrity of the system or whether anything is really "done."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How the process is structured into steps, roles, and hand-offs. How many people touch the feature? How much time does each step take? How much time is spent waiting between steps? Is there excessive back and forth? Lean Six Sigma has a great framework for studying process cycle time, wait times, and waste across the value stream. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The theoretical speed limit of the current process. You will never know how responsive your process can be when you always slow it down with competing priorities. Often actual speed is much slower than potential speed because of various delays, distractions, and interruptions that are not the fault of the process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whether there are structural blockers like "we only release every 3 months." Or maybe the team is distributed over many time zones with little overlap for hand-offs and feedback.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whether there are capacity blocks like "Joe is the only person who can do that step and he is not available."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How easy it is to monitor the process. Can you go to one place and see the completed and remaining work?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The amount of managerial overhead that the process requires. For example, is there a project manager that needs to track and delegate every task?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The artifacts the process creates. Can you go back and see what was done and why?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How the response to the feature was measured and incorporated into future improvement ideas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After running through a couple of these experiments, I have a pretty good understanding of the process structure, its theoretical speed, its strengths, and its flaws. At that point, we can start to come up with ideas for improvement. The low hanging fruit is usually pretty obvious ... especially to people who have been participating in the process but not paying attention to the overall throughput. Optimizations can be designed collaboratively and tested by future hot lots. I find that teams are generally comfortable with this evaluation because it doesn't target people as much as the framework that people work in. Usually processes (at least as they are practiced) form organically so nobody feels threatened by process improvements -- especially if they are clearly supported by empirical evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if you have been working with a team for a while, try pushing through a hot lot and pay close attention to it. There is really no better way to understand the execution of a process.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon CloudSearch</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I just got an email announcement for &lt;a href="http://aws.amazon.com/cloudsearch/"&gt;Amazon's new CloudSearch service&lt;/a&gt;.  This could be really cool if popular applications and frameworks like Wordpress, Drupal, Rails, and Django build modules/apps/extensions that interface with CloudSearch. It would be nice to have an alternative to Google Custom Search (which has gotten pretty expensive for small sites) or (in the case of Drupal) &lt;a href="http://www.acquia.com/resources/library/acquia-search"&gt;Acquia Search&lt;/a&gt;. I am already using &lt;a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ses/"&gt;Amazon's Simple Email Service (SES)&lt;/a&gt; thanks to &lt;a href="https://github.com/hmarr/django-ses"&gt;Django-SES&lt;/a&gt;.  It's extremely reliable and reasonably priced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The speed with which Amazon is rolling out these services is truly amazing.  It's like every system they build to run amazon.com (the ecommerce business) is a candidate for a new AWS product.  My only concern is Amazon's long term ability to support this increasing portfolio of services.  No doubt they will run into Google Wave-like burnouts that will shake the well earned trust of the development community.  What will they do if a service turns out to be a bad business?  Will they support it at a reduced level or shut it down completely?&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Drupal Meets Bricolage</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bricolage.cc"&gt;Bricolage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://drupal.org"&gt;Drupal&lt;/a&gt; are two CMS that I follow very closely.  I like them both for very different reasons.  Bricolage is a back-end only CMS designed to automate a publishing process and then write a static website (or populate the repository of a dynamic website).  Bricolage does not run on the servers that your visitors hit.  This is great for when you already have your  presentation tier or you have some very specific requirements that compel you build, share, or buy special content delivery capabilities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drupal, conversely, is all front end and the content production capabilities are, by design, quite lean.  Drupal is designed to blur the line between content consumer and contributor.  Adding, editing, and responding to content functionality is built into a single user interface.  Drupal also has nice content aggregation capabilities to bring in content that has been produced on other sites and make it available for a more interactive dialog among visitors.  Lots of traditional media companies are using Drupal to enable community generated content.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what would happen if you put these two systems together?  &lt;a href="http://thetyee.ca"&gt;The Tyee&lt;/a&gt; did just that. The Tyee has been using Bricolage to produce a digital daily newspaper (great content by the way. definitely worth reading) for some time now.  More recently, they &lt;a href="http://thetyee.ca/Tyeenews/2007/01/11/Comments/"&gt;enhanced their comment system by adding Drupal to their architecture&lt;/a&gt;.  But commenting is just a start.  In the future, they will be adding more community-interactive functionality based on Drupal.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a great example of a media company building an audience through traditional publishing processes and then layering in collaborative features to actively engage their readers.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

Ideally, you can use this limitation as an excuse to buy a Mac.  However, if your employer doesn't buy it, consider the &lt;a href="http://try.swift.ws/index.php?title=Main_Page"&gt;Swift Browser&lt;/a&gt;.  It uses the same rendering engine used in Safari but runs on Windows.   I installed it and, although it is very poor functionality-wise, it worked.  Hint:  to get the address bar, you may need to click the tiny triangle in the upper right side of the page (see screenshot).&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Interwoven&amp;#39;s FOSS FUD</title>
    <content type='html'>In a throwback to 2003, the &lt;a href="http://interwovenblog.com"&gt;Interwoven blog&lt;/a&gt; has a post &lt;a href="http://interwovenblog.com/2008/11/19/open-source-is-free-like-a-free-puppy-is-free/"&gt;spreading some good old fashioned FUD about open source software&lt;/a&gt;.  The general message is that, while the software is free, open source will wind up costing you more money in the long run because it lacks the functionality of commercial software (presumably like &lt;a href="http://interwoven.com/components/pagenext.jsp?topic=PRODUCT::TEAMSITE"&gt;TeamSite&lt;/a&gt;).  Like most blanket statements about whole categories of software, the accuracy is dubious.  However, like most myths it is built on a grain of truth.  Here is how...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the choice of build vs. buy, it is nearly always cheaper to buy - or share (in the case of open source software).  The trick is finding the software that most closely matches your requirements to minimize the amount of customization that you need to write.  If the best fit is TeamSite (and sometimes it is), buy TeamSite.  It will be cheaper to buy TeamSite than to take another product and make it just like TeamSite.  Nevertheless, be forewarned; even if TeamSite is a slam-dunk for your needs, the license is not the only thing you will be paying for.  Like any web content management system, expect to spend a considerable amount of money on customization (unless you are totally satisfied with having your site look exactly like the mutual fund demo that the sales engineer prepared for you and 100 other prospects).  Having done TeamSite implementations, I can assure you that TeamSite is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; cheaper than average to implement.   I guess you could say that all CMS are like puppies: some are free, some cost lots of money, but they are all expensive to take care of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Depending on your requirements, the best fit may be a platform that just happens to be open source software.  To give a concrete example, just look at the &lt;a href="http://interwovenblog.com"&gt;Interwoven Blog site&lt;/a&gt; .  You would be crazy to buy TeamSite (at over $100,000 in licensing) to manage a site like this.  That is, unless you were Interwoven, in which case it would be very embarrassing not too.  In addition to the high licensing cost, the amount of configuration to turn TeamSite into a simple blogging tool would be many multiples of what it would take to set up and theme a pure blogging tool like &lt;a href="http://wordpress.org/"&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.movabletype.org/download.html"&gt;Moveable Type&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think what is most interesting about this post is why Interwoven felt the need to write it.  Are they feeling threatened by open source software in general or a specific open source application?  I would much rather them spend the effort in improving their own product than spreading fear, uncertainty and doubt about others.&lt;br /&gt;</content>

    <title>Mollom beats Acquia out of Beta</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://buytaert.net"&gt;Dries&lt;/a&gt; recently &lt;a href="http://buytaert.net/mollom-out-of-beta"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that his comment spam prevention service, &lt;a href="http://mollom.com/"&gt;Mollom&lt;/a&gt;, is out of Beta and is available to the world as a production grade service.  Nowadays, the word "Beta" doesn't mean too much because many of the services that we all use still sport the beta logo as if it were a "new and improved" label.  According to Dries' post, Mollom has already blocked 9 million spam messages.  That means lots of sites are running it and lots of bots are trying to spam them.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In other Buytaert news, the private beta of &lt;a href="http://www.acquia.com"&gt;Acquia's&lt;/a&gt; "hardened Drupal" has been extended.  I got a demo a few weeks ago and think this will be worth the wait if you are looking for a for a commercial-grade Drupal distribution.  Of course, much will depend on the level of support that this start-up is able to provide.</content>

    <title>So, this business analyst walks into a car dealership</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;A customer struts into a car dealership, slams a 200 page requirements document down onto a salesman's desk, and triumphantly declares "I know exactly what kind of car I want to buy."  The startled salesman opens the document to a random section and starts to flip through a few pages that describe a lug nut in excruciating detail.  He looks at another random section and sees requirements about how the steering wheel should be joined to the steering column.  After regaining his composure, the salesman looks up and says "from this document, I can definitely see that you are looking for a car.  What do you want to use it for?"  The business analyst suddenly looks confused and says "I don't know. I don't drive."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not just a lame joke.  It describes a scenario happens all the time in CMS selections.  There are two main problems here.  First is the obvious problem that the customer believes himself an expert in cars because he has done a ton of research but he doesn't have the critical experience of having driven one.  He can name all the features of a car and knows what they do but he hasn't had to use them.  The second issue is more subtle.  His 200 page requirements document is more like a design specification for a product that has already been built.  It goes into details that are unnecessary like how the steering wheel must be connected to the steering column.  What kind of penalty does he give if the steering wheel is connected in a different (and perhaps better) way?  More importantly, there is no way his requirements document can be exhaustive.  It would really have to be 20,000+ pages to cover every detail with same depth.  So entire aspects of the car are probably omitted.  Maybe it was something important like which side of the car the steering wheel is on.  Rather than try to design your own car in a vacuum and then go around and see which one matches it, it would be better to draw up some coarse filters (price, intended usage, etc.) and then look at cars that passed the filter in their totality and see which one feels right.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This sounds obvious for car buying but you would be surprised how many CMS buyers collect requirements like that car customer; Or do the abridged version where they just name countless features (which in car shopping would produce a list like "6 cup holders, 1 gas pedal, 1 brake pedal, 1 clutch (optional), 5 gears, 3 windshield wipers, 6 windows, 4 wheels, 4 tires, 1 spare wheel/tire ...  ").  In many cases the requirements are gathered by people who have never used, nor intend to use, the CMS.   They can't paint the bigger picture of the user, the task, and the content.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By focusing on &lt;em&gt;how people work&lt;/em&gt;, rather than the features themselves, CMS evaluation criteria can identify features that are important &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; with enough context to understand which implementations of that feature will make it useful.  In the car dealership story, if the customer walked into the dealership and said "I drive like a maniac and the wheels of my last three cars fell off," the salesman would not only know that the customer needed lug nuts but really beefy lug nuts, a good suspension, and perhaps a driving lesson.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scenarios are the best way to capture this context for a software selection.  A good scenario will describe the intent behind the task (what is the user trying to accomplish?), the context (what time, resources, and information does the user have?) and the flow (how does the person work? Who else does he need to collaborate with?).  In the process of documenting a scenario, a number of features will be identified &amp;mdash; features you might not even think of in a requirement brainstorming session.  After writing a scenario, I typically list features at the bottom of the scenario to call out what functionality was used.  Scenarios don't have to be long or comprehensive.  Usually 1/2 to 1 page will capture enough of the story to understand what needs to happen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To beat on the car buying analogy once again, you could think of a scenario like the route for a test drive.  If you live in a city and rarely use a highway, the best test drive would be to drive in traffic and try to parallel park and park in your neighborhood parking garage.  That would be more informative than driving on the interstate.  If you test drove all the cars on the same route you would notice some big differences; like that you can park the Honda Fit in a compact car space but you can't even get the Ridgeline into the parking garage because the turning radius is too big.  Your average car dealer probably will not give you much flexibility on your driving route, but your CMS vendor will (or should).  Use that access to your advantage and create the most realistic driving conditions possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The car buying analogy breaks down in one key area.  When you buy a car, you sign the paper work and then you drive it off the lot.  Content management systems are not like that.  Before you can use a CMS, you need to implement the software to support your content, processes, and web design.  You need to configure, customize, and extend the platform.  Scenarios will help this process because, once you buy the software, they turn into the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story"&gt;user stories&lt;/a&gt; that will drive your implementation planning and long term road map.  Some user stories will be achievable by configuring out of the box functionality; others will take more effort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So when you find yourself slogging through a spreadsheet with hundreds of rows of requirements, think of that car buyer and ask yourself "are these requirements really going to help me find a CMS that I will be able to use to manage my website(s)?"  If you are honest with yourself, the answer will probably be "no."  If it is "no," put away the spreadsheet and start writing scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Mobile Pet Peeves</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2012/07/why-the-redesign.html"&gt;Now that I sorted out this site's mobile problems&lt;/a&gt;, I feel authorized to complain about mobile issues on other sites.  Here are my top four pet peeves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;		&lt;h4&gt;Aggressive App Promotion&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br/&gt;		&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’d LOVE to download your app instead of going to the webpage I just tried to visit!”— No-one, ever. No-one in the future either.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Graham Linehan (@Glinner) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Glinner/status/222779724567547904" data-datetime="2012-07-10T19:50:00+00:00"&gt;July 10, 2012&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;script src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;br/&gt;		&lt;p&gt;You go to a site and get blocked by a dialog box that encourages you to download their app.  When I click on a link or type a URL, I am sending a pretty clear signal that I want the content that is on the other end.  I am not looking for another app to install.&lt;br/&gt;		&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;		&lt;p&gt;If you want to promote your app, use a banner ad slot to make a subtle suggestion.  Don't put up an interstitial that breaks the flow.  A few sites do this nicely by putting a small floating tab on the bottom right of the page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;		&lt;h4&gt;Dialog Boxes&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br/&gt;		&lt;p&gt;Speaking of dialog boxes, don't put them on your mobile website at all.  If you feel like you need a dialog box, make sure to design it for mobile by making the buttons extra big.  Those tiny x's in the corners just don't cut it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;		&lt;h4&gt;Flash&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br/&gt;		&lt;p&gt;The writing has been on the wall for a long time now and, now with Android Jelly Bean dropping Flash support, there is no denying it.  Flash is dead on mobile.  Don't use it &amp;mdash; especially if your site is for a restaurant or any other destination for people on the go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;		&lt;h4&gt;Disjointed Mobile/Full Experience&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br/&gt;		&lt;p&gt;If your content is any good, it will be shared between users on all sorts of platforms.  Someone might first encounter the content on a mobile device and then want to continue reading on the full experience.  To facilitate this, make it easy for a user to jump between content views.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</content>

    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Apoorv Durga on his &lt;a href="http://www.apoorv.info/index.php"&gt;PCM Blog&lt;/a&gt; has a &lt;a href="http://www.apoorv.info/index.php/2006/01/07/from-vignette-to-opencms/"&gt;nice post&lt;/a&gt; about a migration from &lt;a href="http://www.vignette.com"&gt;Vignette&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="http://www.opencms.org"&gt;OpenCMS&lt;/a&gt;.  The overall project went well and the client was pleased with the results.  Apoorv also points out that some features are missing from OpenCMS most notably large site features such as replication and backup.  For example, in Vignette, you have a staging server where you manage content and a production server where you display content.  OpenCMS does not have that so you you have one server (or cluster) doing both content management and delivery.  This may have security and (in extreme cases) performance implications (although with caching turned on and clustering, it is likely that it is not an issue.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If content syndication is important, you might try &lt;a href="http://www.magnolia.info"&gt;Magnolia&lt;/a&gt; which has a subscriber model that allows an authoring server to publish content to display servers.  Of course, Magnolia is missing many of OpenCMS's advanced features such as versioning and workflow. But if those are not important (frequently people think they need these things more than they actually do), you should give Magnolia a look.  It uses a &lt;a href="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=170"&gt;JCR&lt;/a&gt; (implemented by &lt;a href="http://incubator.apache.org/jackrabbit/"&gt;The Apache JackRabbit Project&lt;/a&gt;) and that is not something that you see in many commercial products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Plone and Zope 3</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Rocky Burt wrote a nice &lt;a href="http://www.serverzen.net/weblog/archive/2006/02/03/plone-and-zope-3"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; on how Plone development is converging with the new Zope 3 architectural patterns through the help of the &lt;a href="http://codespeak.net/z3/five/"&gt;Five Project&lt;/a&gt;.  If you are just coming up to speed, Zope 3 is a major change from Zope 2.x and introduces some modern architectual patterns such as content views in addition to incorporating some critical content management functionality from CMF (Content Management Framework, an add-on product on top of Zope) into the core.  Here Rocky's summary of the benefits and risks:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Benefits&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of course further development, refactoring, and refining the base architecture generally provides a more robust solution to such an extent that businesses have to spend less time and effort managing and supporting deployed solutions. Having reusable components means less time spent developing new components and more time spent plugging in existing components which proves to take less time and thus less expense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Risks&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Migration of existing sites can get quite complicated. Also having to deal with switching frameworks such as making it difficult to maintain backwards compatibility with third-party products. Of course this gets easier as more and more third-party products adopt the same Zope 3 develop techniques which means education of this process moving forward is vitally important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, he concludes that committing to the Zope 3 architecture and development style is the right approach.  I would tend to agree.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Graffito Being Folded into JackRabbit</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://incubator.apache.org/projects/graffito.html"&gt;Graffito&lt;/a&gt; is an &lt;a href="http://www.apache.org/"&gt;Apache&lt;/a&gt; project to build a set of content management components that can be used within portals and other applications.  &lt;a href="http://contenthere.blogspot.com/2005/02/graffito-cms.html"&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is what I wrote about Graffito back in February 2005.  Graffito has been in the &lt;a href="http://incubator.apache.org/"&gt;Apache Incubator&lt;/a&gt; for quite some time and has not been able to graduate to a top level project.  I just &lt;a href="http://www.contenttype.org/node/7"&gt;read&lt;/a&gt; on Christophe Lombart's blog (&lt;a href="http://www.contenttype.org/"&gt;Content Type&lt;/a&gt; - love the name BTW), that Graffito is going to be folded into the &lt;a href="http://jackrabbit.apache.org/"&gt;JackRabbit&lt;/a&gt; project (that itself graduated from the Incubator in March of 2006).  JackRabbit is the reference implementation for the JCR and was critical in getting JSR 170 through the Java Community Process.  It promises to do the same for &lt;a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=283"&gt;JSR 283&lt;/a&gt; which will improve the JCR spec.  JackRabbit also absorbed many of the developers from the &lt;a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/slide"&gt;Jakarta Slide project&lt;/a&gt; (an open source implementation of WebDAV).   Most of the developers on Graffito came from the &lt;a href="http://portals.apache.org/"&gt;Apache Portals&lt;/a&gt; projects and I guess Graffito could have been absorbed by portals as well.  I agree with Christophe that JackRabbit makes a lot of sense because the two projects are aligned around the goal of creating building blocks for content management systems.  Graffito has also done a considerable amount of work building JCR support into the project.</content>

    <title>Goldegg</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cignex.com"&gt;Cignex&lt;/a&gt; recently announced a new project called &lt;a href="http://www.cignex.com/site/company/news/press/cignex-goldegg"&gt;Goldegg&lt;/a&gt; to help bring &lt;a href="http://www.plone.org"&gt;Plone&lt;/a&gt; to a new level.  The &lt;a href="http://www.goldeggstack.org/"&gt;project&lt;/a&gt; involves over 26 developers from about 17 companies and will be working on all layers of the Plone stack (Plone, &lt;a href="http://www.zope.org/Products/CMF/"&gt;Content Management Framework - CMF&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.zope.org"&gt;Zope&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is great news.  Plone is already a very solid CMS for building a wide range of we applications from collaborative workspace to e-Commerce site.  However, Plone has been struggling with how to will deal with changes in the underlying Zope application server which, with version 3, folds parts of CMF into the core product and makes several other fundamental architectural changes.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer, for now, is &lt;a href="http://codespeak.net/z3/five/"&gt;The Five Project&lt;/a&gt; which is a Zope 2 product that allows for the integration of Zope 3 technologies into Zope 2.  However, this is a short term solution that will allow Plone developers to gradually incorporate Zope 3's new features.  In September, there was a sprint in Vienna, Austria to make CMF use Zope3.  Another sprint this week in Fredericksburg, VA will work developing a CMF 2.0 Alpha version.  The final sprint will take place November 7-11 will refine how Plone adds Products (modules) on top of the core.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is also significant because the new project &lt;a href="http://www.alfresco.org"&gt;Alfresco&lt;/a&gt; is going strong and already offers a compelling feature set on Java technologies which is more familiar than Python for many enterprises.  Plone, with its long history and vast install base still has the advantage, but it is good that the community is being proactive about pushing the project forward in such a comprehensive way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since Cignex's Munwar Shariff sits on the board of the &lt;a href="http://plone.org/foundation"&gt;Plone Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, I assume that Goldegg is fully coordinated with the overall Plone project.  The next release of Plone (2.2 code named "Ms. Bumblebee") is due out November 11. It will have some of the Plone view components that came out of the Goldegg work..&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type='html'>For over a month I saw those intertwined colored loops on the bottom right of my screen tempting me.  It wasn&amp;#39;t until I had to start using Outlook (which I HATE - long story, maybe another post) which has really bad search that I finally decided to give Google Desktop a try.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After going through the setup process, I was totally creeped out to see pictures of my kids interspersed with headlines and weather flickering next to my chat contact list.  Then from talking to a friend, I heard something really disturbing.... Apparently, when paired with the Google search bar, Google Desktop hits web sites you have visited *AUTHENTICATED AS YOU!* to index them.  Let alone the fact that Google is indexing your online bank statements and all.  A bot randomly requesting URLs as an authenticated user is a very dangerous thing.  Although web applications are supposed to not execute actions with a GET request.  Some do.  So you could have the bot hitting web based applications and deleting data. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;YIKES! UNINSTALL! UNINSTALL!</content>

    <title>Drupal not listed as an alternative to Wordpress</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cmswire.com/author/anthony-myers/"&gt;Anthony Myers&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://www.twitter.com/xanthonysfx"&gt;@xanthonysfx&lt;/a&gt;)  , from CMSWire,  recently posted an article listing &lt;a href="http://www.cmswire.com/cms/customer-experience/5-alternatives-to-wordpress-019397.php"&gt;"Five Alternatives to Wordpress."&lt;/a&gt; His list was really interesting.  First, he openly left off &lt;a href="http://drupal.org/"&gt;Drupal&lt;/a&gt;, putting Plone there instead.  I really like &lt;a href="http://plone.org/"&gt;Plone&lt;/a&gt; but I would have to say that Drupal is a much closer analog to the core functionality of Wordpress.  The projects even have an ongoing rivalry with each other as shown by Dries's April Fools post &lt;a href="http://buytaert.net/the-red-press-of-drupal"&gt;"The Red Press of Drupal" where he announces that Wordpress is moving onto Drupal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, the author didn't include blogging products like &lt;a href="http://ellislab.com/expressionengine"&gt;Expression Engine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.movabletype.org/"&gt;MovableType&lt;/a&gt; (which, I hear, is improving), and &lt;a href="http://www.squarespace.com/"&gt;SquareSpace&lt;/a&gt;.  The products that he listed (&lt;a href="http://www.businesscatalyst.com/"&gt;Adobe Business Catalyst&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://plone.org/"&gt;Plone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://fdv.github.io/typo/"&gt;Typo&lt;/a&gt; (I have a feeling Anthony meant &lt;a href="http://typo3.org/"&gt;Typo3&lt;/a&gt;, not this relatively obscure Rails blogging platform), &lt;a href="http://umbraco.com/"&gt;Umbraco&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://ez.no/"&gt;eZ Publish&lt;/a&gt;) are all traditional, page-oriented (as opposed to post-oriented) platforms. This shows that Wordpress, at least in Anthony's eyes, has grown out of its blogging roots and readers would be considering it for traditional web content management.  I would have to agree with Anthony on this.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third interesting thing about this article is that the various software communities didn't flood it with comments and other reactions. I would at least expect the very large Drupal community to dive in and lobby for their inclusion.  Maybe the link-bait title of this post will change that. :)&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>CMS Selection Checklist</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;A few days ago, I was asked by a potential client to provide documentation on my CMS selection process.  As readers of this blog know, I write &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2006/10/selecting-a-cms.html"&gt;a &lt;strong&gt;LOT&lt;/strong&gt; of articles on the various aspects of selecting a content management system&lt;/a&gt;.  Probably the most concise descriptions are these two: "&lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2006/10/selecting-a-cms.html"&gt;Selecting a CMS&lt;/a&gt;" and "&lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2007/05/how-to-select-a-cms.html"&gt;How to Select a CMS&lt;/a&gt;."  These posts go pretty deep and I have many other posts that go deeper into the specific activities.  But, I still felt like I was missing a nice clean (less bloggy) overview.  To solve that problem, I put together this &lt;a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/57210974/CMS-Selection-Checklist"&gt;CMS Selection Checklist&lt;/a&gt;.  The most fun part of writing the checklist was finding all the articles that I wrote over the years that discussed each element of the process.  I also see areas where I can write more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a title="View CMS Selection Checklist on Scribd" href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/57210974/CMS-Selection-Checklist" style="margin: 12px auto 6px auto; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,Sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; -x-system-font: none; display: block; text-decoration: underline;"&gt;CMS Selection Checklist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;iframe class="scribd_iframe_embed" src="http://www.scribd.com/embeds/57210974/content?start_page=1&amp;view_mode=list&amp;access_key=key-48pic48jrt7q2nrp5od" data-auto-height="true" data-aspect-ratio="1.2938689217759" scrolling="no" id="doc_74307" width="100%" height="600" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;(function() { var scribd = document.createElement("script"); scribd.type = "text/javascript"; scribd.async = true; scribd.src = "http://www.scribd.com/javascripts/embed_code/inject.js"; var s = document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0]; s.parentNode.insertBefore(scribd, s); })();&lt;/script&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Magnolia Conference 2009</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://magnolia-cms.com/conference"&gt;Magnolia is hosting its first big user conference this September 10th and 11th in Basel Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;.  I was going through the program and it looks great.  There are two tracks: one for business users and the other for developers.  The developer track has &lt;a href="http://magnolia-cms.com/home/conference/program/speakers.html#DavidN"&gt;a session where David Nüscheler will talk about the new JCR Specification (283)&lt;/a&gt;.  There will also be two people from &lt;a href="http://magnolia-cms.com/home/customers/case-studies/texas-state-university.html"&gt;Texas State University to talk about their work with Magnolia&lt;/a&gt;.  If you are using or considering Magnolia CMS and can talk someone into sending you to Basel, definitely try to go (&lt;a href="http://magnolia-cms.com/home/conference/register.html"&gt;register here&lt;/a&gt;).  You can even get a 30% discount off of the &amp;euro;200 standard price if you use the code "mconf09gottlieb".</content>

    <title>Network-Centric Web Services</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.onenw.org/jon/archives/2006/02/27/single-stacks-or-network-centric-web-services/"&gt;Jon Stahl wrote an excellent post&lt;/a&gt; recommending the construction of "cross-stack applications" rather than choosing a single platform and hanging all your applications off of it.  In the post, Jon also lists some applications that have excellent APIs for integration.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only thing I would add is that I am hoping a shift away from "Enterprise Applications" which connotes one big system that does everything for everyone (which leads to Enterprise Licenses and Enterprise Lock-In), to "Enterprise Architecture" which focuses more on interoperability and best of breed.  I am also happy that I am seeing this meme more and more in the open source world because that is where open source has a distinct advantage over proprietary software which tries to add more breadth with every release.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, this does raise an issue with the internal I.T. organizations that try desperately to increase efficiency by reducing the number of tools and frameworks that they need to know.  This is largely a cultural factor.  At some places I have worked, developers are always itching to try and learn new technologies.  Other places have developers who are afraid of being made to look foolish by what they do not know.  Being a long time consultant, you can probably guess what camp I fall into.  For me, having a cross-technology perspective and constantly struggling with new syntax is what makes programming more interesting than just getting paid to type.

    <title>Principles of Usability</title>
    <content type='html'>James Robertson just posted another great article on usability called &lt;a href="http://www.steptwo.com.au/papers/kmc_usabilitycms/index.html"&gt;11 usability principles for CMS products&lt;/a&gt;.  I think all of these principles are worth keeping mind when selecting or building a CMS (or any software for that manner).  In response, &lt;a href="http://cmprosbenelux.org/author/Adriaan+M.+Bloem/"&gt;Adriaan Bloem&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="http://www.radagio.com/"&gt;Radagio&lt;/a&gt; posted this great comment on the &lt;a href="http://www.cmpros.org"&gt;CM Professionals&lt;/a&gt; mailing list:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Much of what makes web 2.0 examples work is based on the fact that in one way or another their use is much more intuitive than that of "classic" content management systems. Everyone can relate to the fact that a blog places the newest item on top; or that a wiki links through keywords; or that you can simply enter a couple of tags on a photo site and you'll be able to search those. "They make it look so simple", yet what we see in CMS interfaces is another turret, flag or tower on the castle and a little bit of AJAX thrown in to be buzzword-compliant.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can't even count how many CMS products have added drag and drop sorting to their old "operating system" of a user interface just to claim they understand and deliver a Web 2.0 experience.</content>

    <content type='html'>Hi Seth,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;thanks a lot for the write-up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I generally think that there are a couple of interesting points to be observed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First and foremost it is important that every customer is free to choose in CRX between a traditional RDBMS persistence (where of course all the major DB vendors are supported) and the TarPM.&lt;br&gt;And I completely agree with you that customers that have an experienced DBA team, but do not have Filesystem experience (for example already have SAN &amp;amp; NAS infrastructure) should definitely choose what they are comfortable with from an infrastructure perspective, operational stability clearly outweighs performance gains.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While the TarPM&amp;#39;s performance certainly is a very appealing feature that yields write performance gains by factors, it is in my experience not the single driving feature for choosing CRX over Jackrabbit. I would like to mention things like Service Level Agreements, ease of clustering, hot backup, built-in Web caching or just simply production level resilience as well as application level features.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The most important differentiation of TarPM to any other means of persistence (like an Oracle DB) is that it specifically does not choose a proprietary persistence but chooses a well known file format, that a very broad group of people can handle. We are essentially just talking about a rolling set of tar files with fixed a fixed size each.&lt;br&gt;In this sense the TarPM is fundamentally different from any other (relational and non-relational) database.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While there maybe people that understand the underlying persistence of an oracle database at a great level of detail, there are definitely more people that understand and can handle a Tar file in case they for example would need to go in there and validate transactions or even do something simple like rolling back to a particular state.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think it is also important that Thomas&amp;#39; background is really an RDBMS background developing both HSQLDB and H2 which I consider the &lt;br&gt;best and fastest embedded Java Database. &lt;br&gt;http://www.ohloh.net/accounts/ThomasMueller&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks again for discussing the TarPM as we are very excited about it and see it as fundamentally different from any other proprietary or commercial database&lt;br&gt;I really enjoy having these conversations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;regards,&lt;br&gt;david</content>

    <title>John Newton on the Commoditization of ECM</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;John Newton's blog post on the &lt;a href="http://newton.typepad.com/content/2006/09/commoditization.html"&gt;commoditization of ECM&lt;/a&gt; was so good that I nearly stood up and clapped when I finished reading it.  In this article, John talks about how ECM has become commoditized - not to the point where the business problems are easily solved but rather to the point where growth is flat and differentiation is vendor size rather than functionality.  As with most commoditized markets open source brings an opportunity to put in infrastructure that provides basic services at reduced cost so that resources are available to invest in integration and deployment.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alfresco is not afraid of the fact that "size matters" in this mature market with EMC, IBM and Microsoft dominating.  He believes that open source gives Alfresco an advantage over the heavyweights because of reduced product development and marketing costs and faster innovation cycles.  It is interesting to hear Alfresco talk about open source because they are both consumer and producer of open source and they benefit from both sides.  As a consumer, they were able to quickly build their product using best of breed open source components from external projects that they can collaborate and partner with (just like any enterprise can).   As a producer they are able to have a longer, more cost-effective reach because their software is freely downloadable: "Open source is therefore able to go farther and broader than even Microsoft to places that commercial software has not been to before, especially Enterprise Content Management."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In drawing parallels with other infrastructure markets, John points out the relational database software and the Java application server markets.  Both of these matured into their present state of a massive consolidation of the commercial market accompanied by real opportunities for open source vendors as demonstrated by the success of &lt;a href="http://www.mysql.com"&gt;MySQL&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.jboss.com"&gt;JBoss&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.redhat.com"&gt;RedHat&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Great blog.  I encourage you to read it if you have not already done so.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Designing for mobile</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sggottlieb/5555866701/" title="austin-powers-steamroller by sggottlieb, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5270/5555866701_bc68795b23.jpg" width="500" height="218" alt="austin-powers-steamroller" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have been hearing that mobile as a first-class content consumption device is "right around the corner" for around 12 years.  At first, I was really excited by the prospect.  Then, over time, I started to become skeptical and ignored the prophesies.   Part of the problem was that I was always on the laggard end of phone gadgetry.  Then a few years ago I got my first iPhone and my attitude started to change.  I was actually using the web on my phone!  It often sucked but that was OK because I was on the bleeding edge and we bleeding edgers can handle little inconveniences.  Now all of the sudden, however, the mobile web is truly ubiquitous.  Everyone has a smart phone &amp;mdash; even people who "don't do technology."  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of you reading this are probably wondering why I am writing on such an obvious topic.  The analysts have been talking about this trend for years.  Well, I am writing this because despite all the prediction this trend is &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; taking us by surprise in various ways.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A publishing client of mine recently told me that they are getting 20% of their traffic from mobile devices &amp;mdash; &lt;strong&gt;20%!&lt;/strong&gt;.  People are still talking about supporting IE 6 and 7.  Together, those browsers make up less than half of that.  In fact, all of IE makes up just 26% of overall web traffic.  My client also shared with me two other interesting facts.  First, email subscriptions are bigger than ever for them.  Remember when people were predicting the end of email?  Those folks were not thinking about mobile.  The fact is, email is still mobile's killer app.  Every baby boomer with a blackberry gets email to his hip-holster.  Email is the primary entry point for my client's mobile traffic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second point he made was around advertising.  Selling advertising on mobile is a challenge &amp;mdash; not because the banner ads are so small (which is what I was thinking) but, because most advertiser websites are not mobile optimized, click-throughs are embarrassing for the advertisers.  The customers who are clicking through are not just the tech savvy people who have the skills to accommodate some glitches.  These people just see "broken" and move on.  This creates an interesting dynamic that is similar to the early days of the web when web publishers needed their advertisers to build nice looking websites to get online advertising revenue.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think most web teams are like me.  We have been hearing about mobile forever.  We had plenty of time to prepare but still we are caught off guard.  We may have over-invested too early and were hesitant to get burned again.  But now companies know they are behind.  They are trying to catch up throwing cash into flashy apps.  However, maybe money would be better spent on less sexy technologies like email subscriptions and mobile-optimization of their various websites.  That would sure go a long way.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Open Source Governance within the Enterprise</title>
    <content type='html'>I recently spoke to a friend of mine, who works for a large financial services company, about their open source policies and practices.  The big financial services companies are, in general, slightly ahead of the curve in their use of open source.  That, and the fact that they are also highly regulated and have a potential high risk exposure, makes financial services a good place to look for open source governance models.  Why do you need an open source governance policy and procedures? Because open source software can be acquired differently than commercial software.   Unlike commercial software whose acquisition can be regulated as it goes through a budgeting and accounting process, open source can be freely downloaded and used without institutional awareness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like it or not,  your company is probably using more open source software than you are aware of.   In fact, if you are building web applications in anything but &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/net/default.mspx"&gt;.NET&lt;/a&gt;, I would be surprised if you didn't use some open source framework or development tool in your custom application.  You would be crazy not to.  Companies that have not adapted to the existence of open source usually have what I call a "flavor of the month" architecture where the next application is built on what was written about in the last post on &lt;a href="http://slashdot.org/"&gt;Slashdot&lt;/a&gt;  or &lt;a href="http://www.theserverside.com/"&gt;The ServerSide&lt;/a&gt;.  I am not saying variety is a bad thing.   There just needs to be a reason to use something different - like different requirements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are some things that this company does to manage software in a world where open source exists.  I have heard similar processes at other major companies that I have spoken to so this company is not unique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Define what open source is.  They exclude Linux (which they consume like commercial software with support contracts and all) and open source software bundled in commercial products.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Accept that open source is out there and has potential value.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sponsor a cross line of business open source review board.  This organization is responsible for responding requests to use a new open source application.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Manage a list of all usages of open source software within the firm.  If you want to use an open source application, for research or production purposes, you consult the list for the software and version that you want to use.  If you find it being used, you communicate your use to the "open source librarian."  If it is not currently being used, you submit a request to the open source review board.  They will tell you if there is a preferred alternative or put it on the list.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Publish a handbook explaining the policy and processes around open source software.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Does this type of program scale down to smaller size companies with less technology discipline than a large financial services company?  I would say yes and, in some ways, it should be easier.  There does not have to be a dedicated review board.  An enterprise architect or architecture group should have an awareness of what software is running on the network: commercial and open source.  This knowledge will help them:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Standardize on some core frameworks.  This will reduce maintenance costs and help with interoperability.  Again, homogeneity is not the goal.  Especially in a web services world, applications do not have to be built on the same platform.  You just need a better excuse to deviate from the standard than "I wanted to see what all the hype was about for &lt;a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/"&gt;Ruby on Rails&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Get to short lists of components quicker.  It is easier to select from a list of pre-qualified options than comb &lt;a href="http://sourceforge.net"&gt;source forge&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://freshmeat.net/"&gt;Freshmeat&lt;/a&gt; every time you want to use a component.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reuse your understanding of licensing implications.  There are many open source licenses and some play better together than others.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Identify internal experts.  If you know that an application was built on a technology, you can ask the developer who built it what they thought of the technology and best practices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if your company is using open source software (and, chances are, it is) it is best to get a handle on what is being used and how.</content>

    <title>Context and the Future of Web Content Management.</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Tom Wentworth, from &lt;a href="http://www.ektron.com"&gt;Ektron&lt;/a&gt;, has written an inspirational article on Forbes called &lt;a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/ciocentral/2011/08/30/context-will-drive-the-future-of-web-content-management/"&gt;"http://www.forbes.com/sites/ciocentral/2011/08/30/context-will-drive-the-future-of-web-content-management/"&lt;/a&gt;.  The article describes a very legitimate strategy for achieving a goal that CMS customers all want: serving their audiences with the right content, at the right time, and in the right format.  The strategy, which uses visitor context (location and device) to infer intent and other preferences, is something that a CMS can help with.  Content management systems have been introducing increasingly sophisticated profiling and presentation functionality to implement elaborate display logic.  Content management systems have always been able to capture the metadata and other configuration that drives this logic.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The right CMS will give you the capability.  But that is only part (and a really small one) of what is needed to be successful in this strategy.  The bigger, harder part is designing, implementing, and testing the rules behind this logic.  How would you treat a visitor differently if you knew his context?  The fact is that you still don't know the visitor and what he wants.  Context may give you a clue or a hint, but you can't be sure.  You can only make assumptions and these assumptions may be very wrong.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These assumptions are like any stereotype.  Sometimes they are accurate and you look like you have some kind of sixth sense. But when they are wrong, you better be prepared for damage control because you can look like an idiot and frustrate people.  Success with a context-based strategy, or any other personalization depends on  1) knowing the likelihood of being wrong, 2) knowing when you were actually wrong, and 3) recovering from a mistake.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's take these elements in a concrete example.  Let's say you work for a movie theater company and have a theory that the mobile visitors to your website only want to see showtimes and directions.  One of your customers sees a help wanted sign at one of the theaters with a link for information on how to apply.  This young applicant's only computer is a smart phone (an increasingly common phenomenon).  He goes to the website and is redirected to a mini-site that only has show times and directions.  He can't get to the desktop version of the site with job information.  You just lost a job applicant and embarrassed yourself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Running through the tests.... You might think it was a reasonable assumption to only show certain information to mobile users, but if you were not absolutely sure, you could have put a link to the full site and suppressed the redirect logic.  How would you know about this incident?  Are you tracking clicks on that "desktop version" link?  Was there a place to leave feedback?  Or will that incident only be seen as a bounce in your traffic report?  If you figured out what happened, what are you going to do about it?  Do you have the resources to correct mistaken assumptions and continually improve the behavior of the site(s)?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I really like Tom and what he has done at Ektron since he joined.  In particular, Tom has helped focus Ektron and elevate the discussion about serving audiences.  Buyers should definitely listen to these ideas but be aware that supporting context-aware visitor experiences adds cost to the initial implementation and ongoing maintenance.  There is more logic to test before you launch the new site; but the real effort is after deployment when you have to constantly test and tune the logic as you see it  respond to real users.  You have to accept that context-driven logic has the potential to worsen visitor experience and be prepared to make corrections.  This means having a team with the time and skills to monitor and adjust the logic.  If you have access to that talent, you should be able to use context information to help deliver great visitor experiences.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Prioritizing Your Markets with Tiers</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I have a lot of conversations with &lt;a href="http://www.globalmarketingops.com/"&gt;Global Marketing Operations&lt;/a&gt; customers about  global content marketing strategy.  Even though it is a small world, there are many markets on this planet and you need to be strategic with your investments to reach them.  The model that our customers find most helpful is where we break down markets into three tiers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sggottlieb/7999833592/" title="Market Tiers Model by sggottlieb, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8455/7999833592_04c49ec7be.jpg" width="392" height="500" alt="Market Tiers Model"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Tier One&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;		&lt;p&gt;Tier One consists of your top revenue producers.  This is usually your home market plus a couple of nearby markets that have been doing business in for a long time.  Companies that are new to internationalization may have only a single Tier One market. &amp;mdash; any business from outside the home market is purely accidental.  Mature global businesses might have 3 or 4 tier one markets.  Some of the larger companies have up to 10.  &lt;br/&gt;		&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tier One markets should have their own regional offices with marketing departments that are capable of generating original content that is tuned to the interests, culture, and calendar of local population.   You can optimize the efficiency of these local marketing teams by translating and re-purposing content from your home market. But with that much revenue at stake, you should have a local presence keeping an eye on things from a local perspective.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;     &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Tier Two&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;		&lt;p&gt;Tier Two is made up of your fastest growing markets. Revenue may be small today and growth might be a short term anomaly, but you want to nurture these markets because some of them might have potential to be new Tier One markets for you.  Collectively, Tier Two might be responsible for a considerable portion of your overall revenue grotj.  You want to treat these markets with a first-class experience but you need to do it efficiently. Balance cost reduction with experimentation and responsiveness to opportunity in Tier Two.  You want to tune and experiment to see what response you can get from these markets.  But you don't want to over-invest because the long term potential may not be that great.  &lt;br/&gt;		&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the content that you serve Tier Two markets is going to directly localized (translated and adapted for cultural compatibility) from the home market.  Of course, you want to be able to filter out what you know will not be relevant. You should invest in things like local search engine optimization and social media and be paying very close attention to web analytics and sales data.  You may need a local marketing team to do this, or you may not.  Perhaps you land the local marketing team when the market shows movement toward your Tier One zone.&lt;br/&gt;		&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Tier Three&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;		&lt;p&gt;Tier Three is the long tail &amp;mdash; all the markets that don't fall into tiers 1 and 2.  You want to maintain a quality digital presence in these markets but you want to do it cost effectively.  If you are successful, cumulatively Tier Three could be a decent profit source and can be the farm system to recruit your next Tier Two markets.  Otherwise you will either over-spend or one of your competitors will beat you into a market with great potential because you didn't invest enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Market tiers should also drive your content technology architecture.  If you have multiple, distinct Tier One markets, you will need a CMS that supports multiple semi or fully autonomous sites.  Depending on your governance model, you might need to be able to "lock-down" certain site sections to give centralized corporate marketing direct control.  Some companies are totally decentralized and allow Tier One markets to operate their own instance of the CMS.  I wouldn't advise different markets going with a totally different CMS platform.  Doing is more expensive because you need to maintain more expertise and you might need to do integration in order to share content.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tier Two might start out with a &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2012/02/introduction-to-translation-proxies.html"&gt;translation proxy&lt;/a&gt; as long as the proxy technology allows you to easily filter and/or replace content.  As it inches toward Tier One, you might want to give a Tier Two market a sub-site as long as your platform allows you to efficiently replicate and localize home market content.  Otherwise, supporting the sub site will be more work than it is worth.  Whatever you do, try to discourage Tier Two markets from building out their own infrastructure.  It is costly and will be difficult for them to maintain to the level that your brand deserves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tier Three markets should never run their own websites.  This is where embarrassing happen like butchered logos and layouts that look like they were stolen from GeoCities or MySpace.  In my opinion, translation proxy is 100%  the right choice for Tier Three.  A useful technique here is to build smaller "International Site" on your home infrastructure.  This site is style-guide compliant and brand-worthy but has pared down content and functionality.  You don't update it as often and you avoid time sensitive content like an "upcoming events" section.  Then you use a translation proxy to efficiently localize this site for all your Tier Three markets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most companies stumble into internationalization after years of vague expectation.  They know there is opportunity outside of their home market and plan to get there one day.  Then they find some compelling event that initiates a poorly executed project.  This could be rogue site implemented by a team without time or budget. Or it could be a monster project that gets scuttled when people start to realize &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2012/07/retro-fitting-your-wcm-system-for-localization.html"&gt;how hard it is to retrofit a WCMS for internationalization&lt;/a&gt;.  If this sounds like your company, don't feel bad.  You would be surprised how big and well known companies struggle with this.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news is that by strategically targeting markets and making the right investments to get there, you can easily outperform most of your competition.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>DjangoCon 2008</title>
    <content type='html'>The &lt;a href="http://www.djangoproject.com"&gt;Django&lt;/a&gt; community recently announced the first official Django conference. &lt;a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2008/jul/13/djangocon/"&gt;DjangoCon 2008&lt;/a&gt; will be held at Google's Mountain View headquarters on September 6th and 7th to coincide with release 1.0 of the platform.  Admission is free (as in beer) but they are capping the attendance at 200.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are new to Django, Django is am open source web application development framework written in the &lt;a href="http://www.python.org/"&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt; programming Language.  Despite its sub-1.0 status, Django is quite mature.  It was first developed by the folks over at Lawrence Journal-World for sites like &lt;a href="http://www2.ljworld.com/"&gt;ljworld.com&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://lawrence.com/"&gt;lawrence.com&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www2.kusports.com/"&gt;KUSports.com&lt;/a&gt;.  Later, &lt;a href="http://www.robcurley.com/"&gt;Rob Curley&lt;/a&gt; assembled a team over at the &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/"&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt; to build a bunch of local sites.  Now Django is bundled and actively used in &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/"&gt;Google App Engine&lt;/a&gt;.  There area also a number of books on Django.  I am currently reading the &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Definitive-Guide-Django-Development-Right/dp/1590597257/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1216348078&amp;sr=8-1"&gt;Definitive Guide to Django&lt;/a&gt; by Adrian Holovaty and Jacob Kaplan-Moss.  So far, so good.  I see a lot in common with &lt;a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/"&gt;Rails&lt;/a&gt; and the two definitely seem to get along at least at a philosophical level.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;object width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/PLUS00QrYWw&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/PLUS00QrYWw&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be covering Django in an upcoming report about web content management in media and publishing because of Django's widespread use in that industry.  There is a small commercial CMS called &lt;a href="http://www.ellingtoncms.com/"&gt;Ellington&lt;/a&gt; that is specifically designed for the newsroom.  Do you have any experience with Django or Ellington? I would love to talk to you about it.</content>

    <content type='html'>Your post and Nicolaisen&amp;#39;s comment have been helpful. I was hoping you could comment on the sort of project that I&amp;#39;m doing, and that Nicolaisen sort of did, too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&amp;#39;m trying to use trac to list projects to be done for a Web site. It&amp;#39;s all HTML coding and maintenance; no full-scale programming like you describe. (You write it, you test it, you upload, you test again.. that&amp;#39;s it.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So I am planning on making &amp;quot;hierarchical&amp;quot; milestones like &amp;quot;update html&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;update html/about us&amp;quot; &amp;quot;update html/products&amp;quot;. I&amp;#39;m pretty wary of making different projects, b/c I&amp;#39;m afraid I&amp;#39;ll completely lose track of stuff if I&amp;#39;m trying to keep my eye on multiple trac environments. I really need one master list of tasks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Helpful comments? Scornful replacement instructions? they&amp;#39;re all welcome.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;thanks!</content>

    <title>Oracle to buy Stellent</title>
    <content type='html'>I feel like one of my basketball pool teams just got eliminated.  &lt;a href="http://www.oracle.com"&gt;Oracle&lt;/a&gt; just &lt;a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/bizj/061102/1371279.html?.v=2"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that it intends to buy &lt;a href="http://www.stellent.com"&gt;Stellent&lt;/a&gt;.  I &lt;a href="http://contenthere.blogspot.com/2006/08/ibm-agrees-to-buy-filenet-for-16-bln.html"&gt;had them&lt;/a&gt; get scooped up by &lt;a href="http://www.hp.com"&gt;HP&lt;/a&gt;.  In addition to the disappointment of a failed prediction, I feel a sense of doom for Stellent's evolution in the field of usability.  If they are lucky, Oracle will leave the product alone.  Otherwise, content authors should get used to command line tools in much the same way all real Oracle database administrators still love their SQLPlus.</content>

    <title>PDF or HTML?</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Alex Manchester, from &lt;a href="http://www.steptwo.com.au/papers/cmb_pdfintranet/index.html"&gt;Step Two Designs&lt;/a&gt; has a very useful article on &lt;a href="http://www.steptwo.com.au/papers/cmb_pdfintranet/index.html"&gt;when to publish Intranet content in PDF format rather than HTML&lt;/a&gt;.  I agree with Alex's point that PDF is suboptimal for most content because of several limitations (most of them around the additional overhead in editing and reading the document) but still has its place: like for documents that are distributed for printing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Too often PDF serves as a crutch for users with limited web content management tools and skills.  For many, it is easier to save a MS Word document as a PDF and upload it than to work with HTML (either through a CMS or using an HTML editor).  The real cost of using PDF occurs after the content is published when users have to wait for Acrobat to load only to find that the document is not what they are looking for and when the document needs to be updated but the original Word document has been lost.  I think the most painful abuse is the case where the company has a wiki and users upload MS Word and PDF files as attachments rather than edit the content in the pages. Doing this degrades your wiki into a poor man's shared drive &amp;mdash; and that is very poor.  &lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type='html'>Seth’s July 9th blog post, “Apache Software License, Hippo and Bluenog” contains numerous inaccuracies that we would like to address:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Contrary to Seth’s assertions, our use of Hippo 6.x in our ICE CMS is acknowledged on our web site (http://www.bluenog.com/site/products/content/website/products/opensource), together with citations for another dozen open source projects. It is also spelled out in our source code.  There is no attempt to hide the use of HippoCMS.  Bluenog does not intend to fork HippoCMS and has stated so publicly (http://www.cmswire.com/cms/web-cms/bluenog-content-platform-gains-fame-sticks-with-hippo-004494.php).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Moreoever, open source software has improved because companies such as Bluenog find creative ways of using and enhancing the core open source project for their customers.  In addition, Bluenog ICE is far more comprehensive than Seth’s post would suggest.  Bluenog ICE combines content, collaboration, presentation and reporting into a single integrated suite – with Single Sign-On, Search, Workflow, Integration and other important features.  The components of HippoCMS that we use are primarily for the content portion of our suite – it is not used for the presentation, collaboration or reporting pieces.  One of Bluenog’s biggest value propositions is the integration of these many different open source projects into a cohesive and supported product, something Seth fails to mention in his post, but others have mentioned publicly after being briefed by Bluenog such as the 451 Group - https://www.bluenog.com/NewsAndEvents/451%20Group%20Report%20Jun%2023%202009.pdf and Basex - http://www.basexblog.com/2009/06/25/in-the-briefing-room-bluenog-ice/.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s important to note that Bluenog has invested several thousand developer hours in adding value and pre-integrating those projects into one seamless package for our clients. Bluenog’s SLA requires response to support questions within typical commercial levels of response, something that cannot be accomplished simply by posting questions to message forums.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another salient misrepresentation is Seth’s assertion that we have violated Apache licensing.  We retain all copyright and license notices of all the open source projects including Hippo.  Our component matrix clearly identifies the components and their licensing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bluenog is very committed to the open source community.  As proof, we have announced our intentions to give back to the community (http://www.bluenog.com/site/particle/content/website/news/press/contributingback.xml). We invite anyone, including Seth, to meet with us so that they can fully understand our company philosophy, product architecture and commitment to being a full and transparent member of the open source community.</content>

    <title>Virtual mess</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;My colleague, &lt;a href="http://blog.wohlrapp.com/"&gt;Sebastian Wohlrapp&lt;/a&gt;, just sent me a &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ODskdEPnQ"&gt;link to this video&lt;/a&gt; of a new desktop metaphor based on a more realistic desktop of piles of paper rather than the more aspirational model of files and folders.  Given that I just moved and my new house is a mountain range of "messy" and "tidy" piles, it was probably the wrong time for me to  watch this video :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It does raise an interesting point.  Most desktop environments were designed by very organized people - people who actually file things in folders and put things away.  So the desktop is  really just a temporary holding area for what you are currently working on.  Once you are done with something, you file it.  However, maybe most people don't work that way (even though they aspire to).  Their physical desktop environment looks like the desk shown at the beginning of the video.  "Pile people" have a virtual desktop with over a hundred little icons on it which is even less usable than a messy physical desk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, that raises a big question, do we create an interface where a user can recreate his physical world mess in a virtual world, or do we try to give him tools for more formal organization and hope he can adapt?  The latter has been de facto approach but it does not work for most people who carry over their habits from the real world: take that pile of paper and throw it in a filing cabinet to deal with later.  Or just leave it on the desk until some major purge event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like the physical world, the notion of piles would seem to break down under large volumes of content.  The beginning of the demo was showing chicklet sized icons which gave no indication of what the document was about.  This is not that useful unless you like to constantly sort and examine documents.  If you were a pile person, chances are you would bring in an expert archivist when you had thousands of documents to manage.  Otherwise, your desk would just be a skyline of tall stacks (I once interned for a lawyer with an office like that and, believe me, that model does not scale).   The demo made a lot more sense when dealing with a smaller set of documents like photos that you want to sort through and browse like an album.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The desktop metaphor as a permanent holding area for documents also breaks down when your scope extends beyond an individual user because a desktop is so personal.  To get it to work, the objects on the desk should really be pointers to a shared repository.  Now this is a great idea:  allow users to organize a shared repository in their own way without disrupting the organization of the central repository.  This is really what social tagging is all about: organizing references.  The stack concept is a surrogate for metadata, it would be useful, if behind the scenes the server tagged content with a taxonomy based on the stacks that users put them in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, interestingly, the demo did not show search.  I guess searching in this environment would be a lot like my experience finding things the last couple of days: open a box, look in the box, open another box, look in the box.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think that this metaphor works to enhance the functionality of the virtual desktop but it is not a replacement of a file system or repository.  My concern is that people would tend to get even lazier than they already are and organize in such a way that only works for them in the very short term.  You can only remember what pile holds what documents for a short time before you start to need to go from stack to stack.   And that is what my old lawyer boss spent most of his time doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>OpenCms V7 available and Apache Lenya and will probably skip 1.4 and go
right to 2.0</title>
    <content type='html'>The official stable version of &lt;a href="http://www.opencms.org/en/home/news/070704_v7_available.html"&gt;OpenCms V7 is now available&lt;/a&gt; pretty much right when the project team said it would be.  Key enhancements (in my opinion) are WebDAV support, a content relationship engine for dependency management, and point in time preview (where you can go select a date in time to see what the site looked (or will look) like.  An undelete feature for deleted content is also very welcome.  The &lt;a href="http://www.opencms.org"&gt;OpenCms.org&lt;/a&gt; website has had a face lift too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In other news, the &lt;a href="http://lenya.apache.org"&gt;Apache Lenya&lt;/a&gt; project, which has been working for three years to release version 1.4, is probably going to call this version "2.0."  There was some debate on the mailing list about the ethics of this re-designation ("is this being done just for marketing reasons?").  However, since much of the code has been re-written for this release and it has been three years in the making, I would say that it deserves a major release number.  It is actually quite interesting to compare the angst in version number honesty in open source software to commercial software where it is pretty much all marketing.</content>

    <title>The EU&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;Interactive Knowledge&amp;quot; project</title>
    <content type='html'>Today Sandro Groganz &lt;a href="http://sandro.groganz.com/weblog/2008/03/18/open-source-cms-companies-wanted-for-eu-project-proposal/"&gt;blogged an announcement of a new initiative by the European Union called  the "Interactive Knowledge" project&lt;/a&gt;.  The goal of the project is to promote the latest web standards like &lt;a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-roadmap/"&gt;CSS3&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.w3.org/RDF/"&gt;RDF&lt;/a&gt; (semantic web).  They intend to do this by giving out grants to small CMS vendors and adopters to support these standards.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This program could have a huge impact on those open source projects that focus on standards and bringing the web to the next level.  In &lt;a href="http://buytaert.net/"&gt;Dries Buytaert's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://boston2008.drupalcon.org/"&gt;Drupalcon&lt;/a&gt; keynote, he made specific reference to how RDF can give Drupal the opportunity "to build a graph that connects everything" (&lt;a href="http://contenthere.blogspot.com/2008/03/drupalcon-2008.html"&gt;see my notes&lt;/a&gt;).  There are number of open source projects that are already walking the walk when it comes to standards: &lt;a href="http://plone.org"&gt;Plone&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/"&gt;WCAG&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href="http://www.alfresco.com"&gt;Alfresco&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=170"&gt;JSR 170&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href="http://www.hippocms.org"&gt;Hippo&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://www.webdav.org/"&gt;WebDAV&lt;/a&gt; and soon JSR 170), and &lt;a href="http://www.jahia.org"&gt;Jahia&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=168"&gt;JSR 168&lt;/a&gt;) all place a high value on supporting standards.  Some commercial vendors like &lt;a href="http:www.day.com"&gt;Day Software&lt;/a&gt; have also made huge contributions in developing standards but it is less common for them to take the lead and drive (like Day has).   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Waiting for customers of commercial CMS products to demand RDF has not broken the chicken and egg impasse that holds back widespread adoption of these technologies.  There is no pressure to implement RDF and microformats if no one is using browsers and services that leverage this information.  No one develops technologies to leverage this information if it is not widely available.  Targeting smaller CMS products with money that is meaningful to them seems like a good way to seed the long tail of the Internet with a movement that will get the interest of the larger players.  Remember, the big CMS vendors were the last ones to get RSS.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are interested, please send an email to Wolfgang Maass (wolfgang dot maass at hs-furtwangen dot de) no later than this Thursday, March 20th, 2008.  A little more lead time would have helped but I am sure that if you contact him with your interest, you can get your foot in the door.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content>

    <title>Leading requirements</title>
    <content type='html'>You have just mentioned that maybe the pain you are feeling in managing your web content may be eased by implementing a web content management system (WCMS) and, all of the sudden, I.T. paratroopers are sliding down ropes with their software selection methodology and other "artifacts."  You get suspicious as you recognize the same faces that "helped" you the last time around but are reassured that they have "learned &lt;strong&gt;aLOT&lt;/strong&gt;" from their recent time and expense system procurement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spreadsheets are opened and fingers are poised over keys.  They cue you with "R00001. The system shall be....?"&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"easy to use?" is your diffident response.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"R00001.  The system shall be easy to use.  OK.  R00002. The system shall...?"&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three months later, you have a spreadsheet with a thousand rows of "shalls" that any WCMS vendor (plus most ERP vendors) will say "yes" to.  But, worst of all, &lt;em&gt;they mean nothing to you&lt;/em&gt;.  You are now back to precisely where you started.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What happened here?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Generic requirements gathering processes are self absorbed.  They are optimized to comprehensively &lt;em&gt;find&lt;/em&gt; business requirements, not &lt;em&gt;understand&lt;/em&gt; them within the context of business goals.  And the more the requirements are abstracted from the goal of managing content, the less they mean.  Quantity and completeness are measurements of success rather than usefulness.  What is more, most generic requirements analysis techniques are designed for building custom software rather than selecting software.  While custom software development goes from requirements to design, when implementing an existing WCMS, much of the design is already in place.  The trick to finding a WCMS is to match your needs with a pre-existing design.  Generic requirements are an indirect path to that result.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a WCMS selection, requirements gathering should stop when you have enough information to filter down the marketplace for a (3 or 4 product) short list.  After that, the selection process takes a more experiential aspect where you look at the usability of the software and organizational compatibility with the suppliers that will help assemble the solution (software vendor and systems integrator).  To be sure, this part of the process seems overly subjective to some - but, honestly, how objective is an aggregated "user friendliness" score of 3.2?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I like to focus on what I call "&lt;em&gt;Leading Requirements&lt;/em&gt;."  A leading requirement has at least one of two characteristics: it is &lt;em&gt;important&lt;/em&gt; to the organization and/or it is a &lt;em&gt;powerful filter&lt;/em&gt; on the marketplace.  To be important, a requirement must critically affect daily usage or primary functions of the system.  Powerful filter requirements get to the big demarcations of the marketplace - things like baking vs. frying, technology stack, content modeling, content reuse, workflow modeling, licensing strategies, etc.  By focusing on leading requirements I can usually get down to 3 or 4 viable solutions that (based on industry gossip) appear to be working well at like companies and are sustainable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By focusing on leading requirements, I can afford to take the time to document what each one really means.  For functional requirements, I write "usage scenarios" that describe users using the solution to complete a business task (like publishing an article).  At the bottom of each scenario, I list out the discrete requirements that were identified.  These 2-4 paragraph narratives are then useful in the demo process because they become the script for the customized product demonstration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the product is selected, requirements are refined to determine what features will be enabled or implemented (and how) in the first release (and subsequent releases) of the system.  At this point, you know the platform you are building on so you can explain requirements within the context of the native capabilities of the software.  You can also adjust scope to leverage out of the box functionality and even prototype to clarify what you are talking about.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Focusing on leading requirements is not easy.  It requires intimate knowledge of the business processes and also the content management industry.  Still, there is no faster way to get to a short list of viable products and deeply evaluate them.  If you want to learn more about leading requirements, I am &lt;a href="http://gilbaneboston.com/pre-conference_workshops.html#workshop-a"&gt;teaching a workshop at the Gilbane conference in Boston&lt;/a&gt;.  Will I see you there?</content>

    <title>CMS Implementation Survey</title>
    <content type='html'>I have just finished putting together &lt;a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/B8Y3HJ2"&gt;a survey to collect information on customer experiences of web content management system (WCMS) implementations&lt;/a&gt;.  The survey is designed to be completed by organizations that have implemented a WCMS within the past year.  It consists of 37 multiple-choice questions organized into four sections:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Context:&lt;/strong&gt; the purpose and background of the project.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scope:&lt;/strong&gt; the scale of the project and other related work that was lumped in.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Execution:&lt;/strong&gt; how the project was organized and executed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results:&lt;/strong&gt; how the solution has changed the organization.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I plan to present the findings of this survey at my &lt;a href="http://www.jboye.com/conferences/philadelphia11/program/speakers/seth-gottlieb/#presentation1"&gt;Grading your CMS talk at J.Boye this May&lt;/a&gt; and publish the data here.  I think this data will be of interest to most people involved with content management.  Practitioners, integrators, and vendors all want to know how their experiences compare to that of their peers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you are reading this blog, you are probably affiliated with a number of CMS implementations.  You probably work for a systems integrator or a software vendor.  If that is the case, I could really use your help.  If any of your customers has recently gone through a WCMS implementation, please ask them to &lt;a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/B8Y3HJ2"&gt;take the survey&lt;/a&gt;.   Thanks!</content>

    <title>New Alfresco Review</title>
    <content type='html'>I am pleased to announce an updated version of my &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/products-page/open-source-content-management-in-java/open-source-content-management-in-alfresco/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Open Source Web Content Management in Alfresco&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt;.  The report evaluates &lt;a href="http://www.alfresco.com"&gt;Alfresco Enterprise 3.1's&lt;/a&gt; WCM capabilities for both traditional web publishing and as a framework for building dynamic web applications.  Like all Content Here reports, &lt;em&gt;Open Source Web Content Management in Alfresco&lt;/em&gt; is highly technical and gets into details that a potential buyer should know.  In writing the update, I interviewed systems integrators and technology managers from customer companies for their candid opinions of the product and the software vendor.  I have also personally evaluated Alfresco, supporting documentation, and third party books.  I can safely say that you are not going to get a more thorough and unbiased evaluation of Alfresco anywhere — not even if you pay several times the $200 price.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Long time readers know that &lt;em&gt;Open Source Web Content Management Alfresco&lt;/em&gt; was originally published in February 2008 as part of a larger report called &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/products-page/open-source-content-management-in-java/open-source-content-management-in-java-bundle/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Open Source Web Content Management in Java&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  Because all of the products reviewed in that report have undergone significant upgrades, I have been selling it at a deep discount.  The front matter that explains the marketplace and significant portions of the evaluations are still accurate and relevant so I have decided to offer a bundled product consisting of the original report plus the updated Alfresco review for $400 — that is still 50% off of the original list price.  As I complete updates to the different reviews, I will add them to the bundle and incrementally raise the price to the original full price.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you are evaluating Alfresco for web content management, save yourself time and reduce your risk buy purchasing &lt;em&gt;Open Source Web Content Management in Alfresco&lt;/em&gt;.  If you work for a Java shop and are starting to consider open source alternatives to commercially licensed web content management software, consider the &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/products-page/open-source-content-management-in-java/open-source-content-management-in-java-bundle/"&gt;Open Source Web Content Management in Java bundle&lt;/a&gt;.</content>

    <title>Open Source CMS Categorization</title>
    <content type='html'>A few days ago a colleague of mine  referred me to this Slashdot &lt;a href="http://ask.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/11/18/0043234&amp;amp;from=rss"&gt;posting&lt;/a&gt; about the state of Open Source Content Management Systems. One thing I was reminded of is that the term CMS, means such different things to different people: blog, wiki, message boards, file repository, what I would call a "traditional" web &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CMS &lt;/span&gt;(clear distinction between readers and authors, editorial process, workflow, etc.) and everything in between. "Content" is a very vague term - people to take it to mean whatever is inside the system. So that makes a CMS anything that manages the stuff that it manages. Now it sounds like we are talking about information systems in general. The wikipedia definition does little to narrow the field: "A. &lt;strong&gt;content management system&lt;/strong&gt; (or &lt;strong&gt;CMS&lt;/strong&gt;) is a &lt;a title="System" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System"&gt;system&lt;/a&gt; used to organize and facilitate collaborative content creation." Still, I like it better than "Knowledge Management" but that is another post ;).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So I started thinking about categorizing the broad spectrum of CMS and was thinking that a good way to break down the space is along three axes related to the kinds of business problems they are trying to solve:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) The proportion of contributors to readers.  Or, similarly, the level of differentiation between  contributors and readers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2) The level of editorial control. This could be measured by the number of stakeholders that need to review content before publishing or the amount of refining that needs to be done before the asset is approved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3) What type of content. On one extreme, there are documents such as MS Word documents, video files, static PDFs. On the other side is textual content that can be rendered into web&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;pages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If this model works for you, you might start thinking of CMS implementations that you are familiar with and mentally plot them along these three axes. For example, a company marketing site might have few authors to the number of readers, high degree of editorial control, and mostly textual content.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Where I think this model adds value is that it would allow an organization trying to select a CMS to quickly winnow down that vast universe of products to a subset designed to solve the specific set of problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I know that a lot of effort has been made to compare features of CMS (&lt;a href="http://www.cmsmatrix.org/"&gt;CMS Matrix&lt;/a&gt; does a really nice job on a subset of CMS products). But maintaining comprehensive feature lists is very difficult and the binary scoring of features (has it/does not have it) may not be helpful because the way each feature is implemented determines the utility to the user. Stepping back to the business problem might lead to a more direct path to the solution than to focus on individual features.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once the field is narrowed down the features can be compared in a more qualitative fashion through demonstrations and prototypes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;</content>

    <title>The 6 Million Dollar WYSIWYG Editor</title>
    <content type='html'>Lisa Welchman has a great &lt;a href="http://www.cmswatch.com/Trends/773-The-6-Million-Dollar-WYSIWYG-Editor"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; on CMS Watch Trend Watch that describes the phenomenon of Web Content Management System buyers seeing a CMS as just a wrapper around the WYSIWYG editor.   I can't even begin to say how true that is.  Recently, a client was having his first look at the WCM system that we were  implementing (after not participating in any of the prototyping or reviewing the incremental builds that that we had been doing over several weeks) and he left me a voicemail saying "the administrative interface is all wrong. We have major problems."  As you might expect, I was very concerned.  Anyway, it turned out that all of his issues were around the WYSIWYG editor.  To him, the WYSIWYG editor &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;was&lt;/span&gt; the CMS.  It turned out that it was misconfigured and everything is OK now.  Phew!  That would have been bad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Way back when, I remember the debate over WYSIWYG editors between the CM purists and the user facing pragmatists.  The purists didn't want any markup (formatting) in content and the pragmatists were trying to appease users who wanted to make web pages with as much control as writing a document in Microsoft Word.  The &lt;a href="http://contenthere.blogspot.com/2005/03/wysiwyg-editors.html"&gt;compromise&lt;/a&gt; was to give users free control over &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;small portions&lt;/span&gt; of the page.  However, given the attention that the editors are getting, it appears that the balance is shifting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I think this is natural as WCM goes "down market" to run small web sites that had at one time been just static HTML.  Small websites have fewer authors and less content  so they do not need as much centralized control or content reuse.  Strict adherence to content management best practices is less critical.  All that is needed is a reduced dependence on the HTML literate webmaster.  The CMS  becomes more of an HTML editing and deployment tool.  Ironically, the HTML savvy webmaster that managed the static site frequently becomes the sole user of the CMS.  I would argue that this is not true content management.  But maybe not all CMS buyers need to manage content.  They just need to manage their website.  Still, if you are spending hundreds of thousands on a CMS, presumably you have real content management needs and you should be looking at more than just the WYSIWYG editor.</content>

    <title>What to do when that Wordpress welcome email doesn&amp;#39;t get to the new user</title>
    <content type='html'>When inviting a new user to a Wordpress site, the default behavior is for the system to put that user into a pending state and only activate her when she clicks through on an invitation email. However, if that user never receives the email, you are kind of stuck. You can't activate her because she doesn't show up on the users list. You can't re-create her because she is in that limbo state. I am told that the invitation expires and you can re-invite after that point. But who wants to wait?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work around that I use is to simply delete the record from the wp_signups table:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;pre&gt;delete from wp_signups where user_login = 'username';&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Where username is the username you set when you tried to invite the user.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you don't have direct database access, I would recommend ticking the box that says "Skip Confirmation Email." After that, you can manually set the password and send it through a secure service like &lt;a href="https://lockify.com/e"&gt;Lockify&lt;/a&gt;, or you can send instructions to the user to use the password recovery system to set their own password.</content>

    <title>Two very good posts on the death of Enterprise Software</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.joelamantia.com/"&gt;Joe Lamantia&lt;/a&gt; recently posted two excellent articles on how "Enterprise Software" is losing touch with the real business problems and being displaced by more agile targeted technologies.  You can read the posts &lt;a href="http://www.joelamantia.com/blog/archives/ideas/enterprise_soft.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.joelamantia.com/blog/archives/ideas/more_on_enterprise_software_is_dead.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.   I could not have made these points better myself (although if you have been reading this blog for while, you know that I have tried).</content>

    <title>The Captcha and Mouse Game</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;There has been a lot of Twitter chatter about this &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/26/technology/26captcha.html"&gt;New York Times article on offshore captcha circumvention.&lt;/a&gt;  The article describes how link spammers are hiring cheap offshore labor to manually solve captchas and  dump comment spam on websites.  If you use captcha as the only way to prevent comment spam, you should worry.  However, if you are like me and use captcha only to level the playing field (by taking robots out of the equation), this is not a problem.  In fact, I am happy that it raises the cost of link spamming and safe jobs are going to people that need them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are manual link spammer, don't accept less than a penny a comment.  You deserve it!&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Will Day stay committed to web standards under Adobe&amp;#39;s ownership?</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I &lt;strong&gt;JUST&lt;/strong&gt; heard about Adobe's acquisition of Day Software and have to admit my first reaction was total disappointment.  I always admired Day's commitment to architecture and standards.  Day is one of the few upper upper tier web content management companies to stay focused on the web &amp;mdash; not just as a place to dump files but as medium for information exchange and creativity.  David Nuescheler and Roy Fielding seemed to have a vision for how systems could openly interoperate through lightweight architectures like &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer"&gt;REST&lt;/a&gt; and standards like the &lt;a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=283"&gt;JCR&lt;/a&gt;.  Day has also been a great contributor to the Java community by pushing lighter weight technologies like &lt;a href="http://www.osgi.org/Main/HomePage"&gt;OSGi&lt;/a&gt; and server-side JavaScript to keep Java relevant in a &lt;a href="http://peteryared.blogspot.com/2003/09/application-servers-2004-big-muffin-in.html"&gt;trend toward dynamically typed, scripting languages like PHP, Python, and Ruby&lt;/a&gt;. Day promoted this vision through the products they sold and also by contributing to open source projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I feel the complete opposite about Adobe.  Adobe seems more interested in conquering the web than improving it.  While Adobe has contributed several technologies that lowered barriers to entry,  I think the overall net impact has been negative.  Yes we have more content on the web thanks to Adobe, but much of that content is locked in Adobe's PDF and Flash formats where it is less accessible (and maintainable) than plain old DHTML.  Adobe customers tend to overuse Adobe technologies like PDF for online forms when HTML would have done quite well. Flash-based navigation is also a problem;  I can't tell you how many restaurant websites I have been where you can't link to a specific page because the whole site is one Flash movie.  As a web consumer, how many hours have I waited for Acrobat reader to install/upgrade plugins (which further degrade performance) before allowing me to read PDFs that I clicked on?  Expert tip:  &lt;a href="http://xevio.us/blog/douglas/adobe-pdfviewer-safari-plugin-no-thanks"&gt;disable the PDFViewer plugin for Safari&lt;/a&gt;. Don't even get me started on &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2010/06/html-production-for-cms-implementations.html"&gt;DreadWeaver&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you can see, my frustration with Adobe has been building for quite some time.  It felt good to let that out.  I haven't talked to David or Roy about Adobe so I don't know their opinion of Adobe before or after the merger talks started.  I hope that Adobe permits them (even better, &lt;em&gt;supports them&lt;/em&gt;) to continue their good work in web-based architectures.  More likely Adobe is buying Day for its CRX repository and CQ5's workflow and digital asset management (DAM) functionality to connect creative teams using Adobe Creative Suite (Why couldn't they have just bought &lt;a href="http://www.vjoon.com/products/vjoon-k4-cross-media-publishing-platform/vjoon-k4-at-a-glance/"&gt;vjoon&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=""&gt;WoodWing&lt;/a&gt;?)  If this is the case, I hope Adobe will invest more in web publishing than they did &lt;a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/jrun/productinfo/reviews_news/"&gt;JRun&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Web Content 2008 Notes</title>
    <content type='html'>Flickr tag: &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/wc08/"&gt;wc08&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twitter: &lt;a href="http://twemes.com/?search=wc08"&gt;#wc08&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am on my way back to Massachusetts after thoroughly enjoying my time at &lt;a href="http://www.webcontent2008.com"&gt;Web Content 2008&lt;/a&gt;.  Thank you &lt;a href="http://www.thecontentwrangler.com/"&gt;Scott Abel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.duoconsulting.com/about/people/michaelsilverman.cfm"&gt;Michael Silverman&lt;/a&gt;,  and the rest of the &lt;a href="http://www.duoconsulting.com"&gt;Duo Consulting&lt;/a&gt; team for putting on another great conference.  The event was sold out this year.  I would register early next year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it was great to meet &lt;a href="http://gadgetopia.com/"&gt;Deane Barker&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.symphonious.net/"&gt;Adrian Sutton&lt;/a&gt; and hang out with the old crew: Scott, &lt;a href="http://www.welchmanconsulting.com/lisa.htm"&gt;Lisa Welchman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.openparenthesis.org/"&gt;John Eckman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.intentionaldesign.ca/"&gt;Rahel Bailie&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cmswatch.com/Analyst/22-Gingras"&gt;Jarrod Gingras&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What follows are my rough (and I mean rough) notes from the sessions that I attended.  They are as much for my memory as for your information so feel free to skim and click through to the slides which Scott has conscientiously posted.  Not all of them are up yet but I am sure that Scott will track down all the speakers and beat their slides out of them sooner or later :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Dick Costolo - The Next Content Wave: Hypersyndication (&lt;a href="http://www.webcontent2008.com/chicago/program_detail/the_next_content_wave/"&gt;slides&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h3&gt;The general theme is that the conversation is more important than the content.  Commenters are creating brands for themselves without even having a website.  The conversation is distributed and does not revolve around the source (FriendFeed, Twitter, Digg, Del.icio.us, etc.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a major disruption in the marketplace.  Evidence: the mainstream media companies and investors have been resisting it.  Investors that missed out on opportunities like FeedBurner are seeing potential here.  &lt;br /&gt;[Seth:  I still don't know how these services will monetize the value]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All media is going to be social.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://avc.blogs.com/a_vc/2008/06/what-comes-afte.html"&gt;What Comes After Post Modernism?&lt;/a&gt; is a great post.  The comments (all 132 of them) are just as good.  The problem is social media is that you lose authority.  [Seth: is just just a temporarily as authority shifts to new sources? Will we have the capacity to recognize so many authorities or will authority become more personal?]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What does this mean for advertising?  Feed originated traffic has a much lower CPM than search originating traffic [Seth: that was why I wasn't making millions in Ad Sense on my blog! This makes sense, search is more intent laden.  People search because they need something.  Feeds is more informational.  Advertising strategies focusing on direct response marketing (rather than branding campaigns - see more detail this on my notes from Gian Fulgoni), will get better results from search traffic)]&lt;br /&gt;Feed traffic demands a new strategies for monetizing content.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/"&gt;Get Satisfaction&lt;/a&gt; is a cool new concept.  It allows companies to outsource their customer service.  It is basically a third party hosted forum that allows vendor employees and the community to answer support questions.  Whole Foods is very active with it.  This could harness the power of the "professional commenter" who wants to build a brand out of his expertise.  As a customer, wouldn't it be cool if your vendor and other customers competed with each other to give you the best answer to your question?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Darren Barefoot - The Many-Armed Starfish: Today and Tomorrow in Social Media (&lt;a href="http://www.webcontent2008.com/chicago/program_detail/the_many_armed_starfish/"&gt;slides&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Social media has been around forever.  What is new is broadcast/publishing media and that is turning out to be short lived.  Mash-ups are old too.  Great example of the fact that modern remakes of Elizabethan playhouses are based on a drawing made by an amateur artist visiting the original.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Darren's presentation had lots of ideas from &lt;a href="http://www.shirky.com/"&gt;Clay Shirky&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://journalism.nyu.edu/pubzone/weblogs/pressthink/"&gt;Jay Rosen&lt;/a&gt;.  He describes the rise of the creative class and the notion that the Internet can make you a "little bit famous." In the broadcast, 1 to many style, fame was an all or nothing type of thing.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are 7 characteristics of social media: Conversation (2 way through comments etc.); collaboration (connects people that were not connected.  like wikipedia 7million editors.); sharing; scope (web is infinite. itunes has broken our idea of what an album is); community (find affinity groups); transparency and authenticity;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Piero Tintori - Running an Efficient CMS Evaluation and Procurement Process (&lt;a href="http://www.webcontent2008.com/chicago/program_detail/running_an_efficient_cms_evaluation_procurement_process/"&gt;slides&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h3&gt;I wouldn't normally expect to hear good advice about software selection from the CEO of a CMS vendor but &lt;a href="http://www.terminalfour.com/"&gt;Terminal Four's&lt;/a&gt; Piero Tintori is such a genuine and nice guy that I had to sit in and see what he had to say.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With very little promotion of Terminal Four, Piero did a very good presentation on how to work more efficiently with CMS vendors.  It has been a while since I had worked for a CMS vendor and it was a good refresher see things from the vendor perspective and think about how to make the little adjustments to make the process easier on everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some really good points worth calling out:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Take the time to understand your requirements to write a clear, concise and thoughtful RFP.  The response is going to be 2-3 times as large as the RFP and you don't want documents that take forever to review.  Leaving in irrelevant cut/paste text (like procurement questions designed for other types of products such as "is your product radio-active") or repetitive and/or contradicting requirements shows that you are not serious about your RFP and the vendor will may put less time in the response.  Furthermore, showing yourself to be sloppy may make the vendor inflate the price to mitigate the risk of having to spend more resources to make you successful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Be realistic about timing.  Don't set an overly aggressive timetable.  Everyone hates a hurry up and wait relationship and you want your vendor to take your deadlines seriously.  Piero had some nice rough guidelines of 6 to 8 weeks from RFP to selection on projects less than $50,000 and 8-12 weeks for projects more than $50,000.  Companies should expect 4-12 months from initial inception to selection.  My experience is that there is usually some organizational hiccup that delays these projects.  To make things as efficient as possible, it is best to line up and plan with people from procurement, legal, and budget holders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You are looking for a product that is right for your organization [totally agree].  Piero recommends working with a software vendor that is the same size or smaller than your company [Piero would say that.  Terminal Four is small.  This advice would take big vendors like Oracle and IBM out of most company's short lists.  On the other hand, working with really large software vendors is hard if you are little company].  You should also try working with a vendor that is excited about your project.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Communicate your budget.  Most buyers are afraid that if they tell how much money they have to spend, the price will always be exactly that amount.  However, your budget is one of your requirements and a vendor can tailor his solution better if he knows that constraint.  If the product is way out of your price range, it is a waste of everyone's time to evaluate&lt;br/&gt;it. I would tend to agree with Piero here even though I understand why my clients will want to hold back this information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Follow through with reference checking before you make your choice - not as a formality after it is too late.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Timing is important.  In the U.K. vendors are really busy responding to RFP's in Feb, July, and December.  I know that customers in the U.S. buying from public companies try to do deals around the fiscal quarters to get preferential pricing.  If you try to work with vendors during the busy season, the good vendors (that are busy) will be rushed.  The marginal vendors (who are not busy) will have an advantage.  Also, I know that if you work with a large vendor, it takes them a long time to process a purchase when sales volume is high so you might miss end of the quarter pricing if you try to hold it to the wire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Tim Yager &amp;amp; Jim Thaxton - Size Doesnâ€™t Matter: How to Build and Maintain Huge CMS Projects (&lt;a href="http://www.webcontent2008.com/chicago/program_detail/size_doesnt_matter/"&gt;slides&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h3&gt;Tim and Jim (two developers from Duo) did a great (and funny) talk about migrating big web sites.  It was a little like a midwestern millennial version of &lt;a href="http://www.cartalk.com/"&gt;Car Talk&lt;/a&gt;.  They had useful, down to earth advice about prototyping a solution, migrating content, gradually phasing out the old system, and applying lessons learned to future maintenance and enhancement of the system.  The &lt;a href="http://www.webcontent2008.com/chicago/program_detail/size_doesnt_matter/"&gt;slides&lt;/a&gt; are worthwhile reading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;John Eckman - Upload, Tag, Share, Discuss: Content Management in the Age of User Participation (&lt;a href="http://www.webcontent2008.com/chicago/program_detail/upload_tag_share_discuss/"&gt;slides&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h3&gt;I think John's talk would have been an excellent keynote (future conference organizers, consider it!).  He described it to me as "high concept, low information" but sometimes you need the big ideas to make sense of the little facts.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The big idea that John had was that social media is less about the tools (or containers) and more about the empty spaces within that people fill with their creative energy.  We, as content management professionals, tend to focus on technology and process.  We think that content management should be done by qualified professionals.  Social media is changing things as it breaks down the barrier between the contributor and the reader.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Classic content management is not going away but it is starting to share the stage with community management.  The rest of the talk was about ways to manage a community.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You need to establish norms and standards and socialize community.  Decide what kind of community that you want.  Do you want to create the stereotype of a library (strict rules, quiet behavior), the coffee house (somewhat boisterous), mardi gras (anything goes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not one conversation.  There are many conversations and they can happen in different environments.  Behavior is a function of person and his environment.  Offering different environments will encourage different behavior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How to control communities&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Terms of service. Avoid surprising people.  The terms of service need to be readable and understandable by the community but also have the appropriate protection to satisfy the company.  Wordpress.com has a good model of a legalese version and a common language version.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Identity: anonymity can lead to bad behavior.  Make it easy for people to build a reputation.  If they can build a reputation, they will try to make a good one.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Communities are hard to start but resist the urge to fake it by artificially seeding content.  You can seed content but it has to be real.  There was some follow on discussion about the relative challenge to start social media inside and outside the company.  John said that there needs to be genuine executive sponsorship and real incentives.  I need to follow up with him on this.  We have both worked for companies that talked the talk here but were not successful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Exclusivity for everyone.  All these new services have private betas to create the feeling of exclusivity and establish a value of membership (in addition to controlling growth).  I think that &lt;a href="http://fireeagle.com"&gt;Fire Eagle&lt;/a&gt; is a great example. Invites have been hard to get and this has created a lot of interest around a service that is not all that useful (IMO).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Moderation.  Fully moderated may make you liable for the content.  Meta moderated (slashdot.  Amazon's "Was this helpful?"). Community moderated (flag as offensive).  Post moderated (let it through. check it later).  The R.E.M. tour site (built with Drupal) pulls in content from flickr and twitter.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A mixture UGC/Professional content has higher CPM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take your content and put it in lots of different places.  Interact with customers where they are. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Gian Fulgoni - Maximizing the ROI from Online Marketing&lt;/h3&gt;The big idea is that web marketing is too focused on click through as a measurement of value. We are attracted to click through because it is the easiest thing to measure but there is equal or greater value in delayed purchases (not-trackable) and brand awareness and recall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advertisers are not thinking about enough global campaigns even though the internet is growing more rapid outside of the US.  77% of global internet users are outside of us.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a down economy, advertisers may push more of their ad dollars online because it is cheaper and they can save money.   Online advertising is represents 7% of the total ad spend but there are 40% more ads on the web than on broadcast.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Direct mail is at the top of 21% [Seth: no wonder I get so much junk mail]. Broadcast is 15%.  Newspaper is 14%&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Search is 41% of online advertising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;60% of advertising spend is for branding campaigns.  not direct response.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Search is better for direct response marketing.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The number of unique visitors reported by publishers is inflated by cookie deletion. 30% people delete cookies every month or so (usually 4x per month).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who is clicking?  Most of the clicks come from a small population of young, low income surfers (low value to advertisers).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most purchases are buying offline.  Conversion metrics are missing this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Research:&lt;br /&gt;Direct online was only 16% of buying effect.  21% purchased little later like in another browsing session. 60% bought later offline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ROI is a lot bigger than currently thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Searchers are older, wealthier, and more educated.  Retail is hurting brand and increasing price sensitivity through their price based marketing campaigns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;95% of google ads are not being clicked on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;16% improvement in brand association for top ad - just a text ad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Success of craigslist shows that coupling of content and classified advertisers is less natural in the internet.  when people want stuff.  they don't go to the news content.  they go to the classified site.</content>

    <title>You bought a web page factory, not a webmaster android</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;When a company builds a business case for acquiring a web content management system, a key selling point is this vision of business users being capable and willing to build the website of their dreams.  In this dream, the webmaster and other technical staff are replaced by a hyper-caffeinated, mind-reading, web-savvy &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-3PO"&gt;C-3PO&lt;/a&gt;.  The companies that really buy into this vision are usually thoroughly disappointed with the results of the implementation.  As a consultant interested in his clients success, it is my responsibility to talk my more optimistic clients down to a more realistic set of expectations.  In other words, I have a tendency to rain on parades.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The metaphor that I find to be the most helpful to explain the realistic role of a web content management system is that a WCMS is a web page (and RSS feed) factory.  In some implementations, the CMS is designed to create micro-sites in the same factory-like manner but it is still a factory.  Here are the reasons why:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Like a factory, a web content management system requires up front investment to set up.  Even if the underlying software is free, you still need to configure it to produce the kind of pages that you want.  That investment only pays off after you have produced a certain number of units (pages) so it doesn't make sense to implement a CMS to manage a 5 page website that rarely changes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Factories are set up to produce a limited number of different products.  As much as he would want to right now, a worker on the Chrysler Aspen production line cannot go to his workstation one morning and start building a better selling model &amp;mdash; not the one that he saw driving down the street the day before and not the one he dreamt up as he was sleeping.  All the tooling needs to be reconfigured and he doesn't have the skills to do that.  In fact, most auto factories shut down for a period of time each year to set up the machinery for the new model-year.  The people that do this work have a very different set of skills and permissions than the line workers.  They also have the design specs that have been blessed by the management of the compay.  In the CMS world this translates into content types and presentation templates that technical people usually have to work on.  If you want to build a totally different sub-site with different types of content and different layouts, you need to bring in the propeller heads.  That said, the design of the templates of the content types, could have allowed the content producer to select options or exercise creativity in specific areas.  &lt;a href="http://gadgetopia.com/post/6313"&gt;Deane Barker has a nice post describing these boundaries as load bearing walls.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Factories need raw materials and labor to produce their output.  The input of a content management system is content and it has to come from somewhere.  The CMS will not the make the content but it can be used to add value to the content by providing functionality that a person can use to organize and present the content to different audiences.  Often people look at their webmasters as simple HTML typists but in reality they are usually much more.  The good ones proof read the content that they were given.  They fill in the gaps by creating or finding content that they were not given.  They coordinate content from different providers.  They navigate through the site from the perspective of a visitor.  The "webmaster@" email address forwards complaints to their email address.  The CMS itself won't do that for you.  Only people can do that.  The CMS will not eliminate the webmaster but it will make the webmaster more productive by taking some of the mundane mechanics out of the job.  Maybe the webmaster can be a little less technical and focus more on the coordination and accoutability side of the job.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is often a trade-off between flexibility and simplicity.  One summer during high school, I spent an unbearable day in a factory at a machine that cut three foot long cardboard tubes into what you would see in the center of a roll of duct tape.  I put the tube on an arm, pressed a button and stood back to watch the arm spin and the blades come down.  Then I took the rolls off and repeated.  This was a very simple machine to use, but I couldn't make a paper towel or toilet paper roll with it &amp;mdash; not unless I had a machinist come into re-configure it.  They could have made an even simpler to use machine that loaded the tubes on itself; but that would probably require more machinist time to configure. With a CMS you can simplify the tool by taking away options and control.  For the non-technical user, you need to be very deliberate about what options to expose.  You need to confine their creativity to small areas (like a rich text area in the middle of the page).  Most CMS accommodate this by providing different user interfaces for power users and non-technical users.  This would be the manufacturing equivalent of a special factory for real craftsman to make limited edition products and prototypes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Machines that maximize flexibility and simplicity are achievable but at a cost.  Some machines are exquisitely designed to present just the right options to the operator (in a perfectly intuitive way) and automate everything else.  Getting to this point can take hundreds of refining iterations.  There are diminishing returns on these refinements so it is rare that a company can make the ROI case for this level of investment.  I doubt that Starbucks will ever build an espresso machine that is so easy to use that any customer can walk in and make his own grande, half-caff, soy, triple, iced americano with lemon (in a venti cup).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Being a factory line worker brings less satisfaction than being a skilled artisan.  Like with my short career as a cardboard technician, operating a machine is extremely boring when all the options are taken away.  On the upside, this lets the contributor focus more on the content (where they should be applying their creativity anyway); but if the contributors don't particularly like to write either, you have a problem.  Often content contributors use poor usability as an excuse for avoiding the difficult task of creating content.  If this is the case, no amount of user-friendliness will compel them to take ownership of their content.  Factory workers don't just burst into the plant to voluntarily produce cars.  They need to be motivated by compensation and pride over the quality of their work (what they &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; have control over).  With a CMS, content contributors have less responsibility for layout and branding of the site but they are responsible for the words and pictures and organization of the content.  The quality and craftsmanship of those aspects of the site needs to be recognized.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is hard imagine a worse buzz-kill than to have your knowledge workers and marketing staff picture themselves as machine operators; but I have yet to talk a client out of implementing a CMS (except in cases when they already have a CMS that is working quite fine but they are struggling for other reasons).  The reason why is that once you get past a certain volume of content, you can't manage it without the help of tools that take away some of the personal craftsmanship in design and functionality of each individual page (you can't manufacture a million cars without mass production factories either).  Mass production of pages is a good thing because the audience wants the information, not each content contributor's own personal vision of how it should look.  We tried that model. It was called &lt;a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/geocities/close/"&gt;GeoCities and it didn't work out that well.&lt;/a&gt;  The sites were just awful to look at and the content was out of date.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A web content management system reduces the cost of maintaining lots uniform pages (and sub-sites).  It doesn't help a company rapidly develop new concept websites.  In fact, it often slows down the production of these websites &amp;mdash; especially if the group that wants to do the innovating does not have developers who can access the CMS.  Many media companies have a heavy duty web content management system for their heavy lifting (the bulk of their content on the main site) but use lighter weight frameworks (or CMSs that are designed to be more like frameworks) and custom code for their experimental sites (for example, &lt;a href="http://push.cx/2009/washington-post-update"&gt;The Washington Post and Django&lt;/a&gt;).  But no matter what, if you want to innovate beyond the options and the text areas that were not designed into the CMS implementation, you are talking a software development lifecycle that includes development and testing and developers to do the work.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>California Holds Hearing on Open Source Software in Election Systems</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Apparently the government listened to my &lt;a href="http://contenthere.blogspot.com/2006/01/us-pays-to-make-open-source-safer.html"&gt;assertion that I would only vote on an open source electronic voting system&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;a href="http://www.govtech.net/magazine/channel_story.php/98361l"&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; reports on hearings within the California State Senate about using open source software in election systems.  The article also points to several large companies that are actively using open source: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;A number of private businesses, including Bank of America, Amazon.com, America Online (AOL), DreamWorks, Charles Schwab, IBM, and Merrill Lynch, have begun using open source software for some applications. Furthermore, the Department of Defense, the State of Massachusetts, and the California Air Resources Board have begun to migrate some of their computer systems from proprietary to open source software.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Managing Projects the Open Way</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;One of the things that we try to do at Optaros is leverage some of the best practices of open source projects in our own work with clients.  There are many great articles about applying open source development principles to internal software development projects.  Here are some very simple practices and tools that I find useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We use the source control system &lt;a href="http://subversion.tigris.org"&gt;subversion (svn)&lt;/a&gt; to manage all of our file-based deliverables (code and documentation).  Windows users connect via &lt;a hef="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/"&gt;Tortoise SVN&lt;/a&gt;, which integrates into Windows File Explorer and exposes svn functionality from a right click menu, or the Eclipse plugin &lt;a href="http://subclipse.tigris.org/"&gt;subclipse&lt;/a&gt;.  *NIX users can also use subclipse but many prefer just to use the command line client.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One great configuration in svn is to hook it up to a mail list so subscribers get an email whenever anyone checks in their work.  Subscribing to the svn commits mail list keeps everyone in sync.  You know what has changed and why with the check-in comments.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subversion is primarily designed for managing text files and handles concurrency between users by merging rather than the locking checkout model.  This does not work so well for binary files such as MS Word documents.   However, svn will recognize and notify you of the conflict so you can use the compare documents feature in MS Word to merge documents.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When possible, we write our documentation in HTML with a simple style sheet that applies a common style to all of the deliverables.  These HTML pages are easily converted to PDF to make them more portable.   Using HTML avoids problems like different versions of Word or Open Office mangling formatting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We use a Wiki (&lt;a href="http://wikipedia.sourceforge.net/"&gt;Media Wiki&lt;/a&gt;) for information sharing such as ramp up materials and tips.  Media Wiki has an RSS feed of edits so it is easy to keep up to date with changes.  One very cool use that we have found for a Wiki is to have multiple users work on a document (such as a proposal) together.  The way to do it (in Media Wiki at least) is to create the outline of the document using Wiki headings (==heading==) and save it.  Doing this breaks up the page into multiple editable sections.  Then each team member can work on his/her section by clicking on the edit button for that section.  Once every section is complete, you can click on the edit page link and copy all of the text into a document.  This technique allows a group of people to work rapidly on a document without getting in each others way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I like to use bug tracking software (such as &lt;a href="http://www.bugzilla.org/"&gt;bugzilla &lt;/a&gt;) for more than just recording bugs found in software during QA.  Usually projects start using a bug tracking system once code starts getting delivered.  I like to capture defects, enhancements, dependencies, and issues through the analysis and design of the software as well.  I think this is better than the typical spreadsheet for several reasons.  First of all, there is no concurrency issue: with a spreadsheet, only one person can edit it at a time and you never really know whether you are looking at the latest version.  Second, a bug tracking system can capture the dialog around an issue in addition to the status.  Third, bug tracking systems send emails to the owners and they have the power to update the task (rather than having a bottleneck at the project manager).   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These little tactics really help with the coordination of work and communication within our teams.  They do not require huge process or methodology changes, just the introductions of some (free) systems that automate communication and collaboration so they don't fall through the cracks.  There are many more tips on the development side but I will save those for another post&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Chaining DNS Entries</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Warning: geeky network admin post&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;I see a clear trend of marketing groups taking over &lt;a href="http://contenthere.net/2008/07/product-it-vs-enterprise-it.html"&gt;full responsibility for their organization's digital presence&lt;/a&gt;.  This includes maintaining various publishing systems such as the web content management system and running the website hosting infrastructure.  Once you go down this path, you need to get with IT and start dividing up ownership of the different systems.  Some of these decisions are easier than others.  But the hardest one is often the DNS &amp;mdash; which maps domains and subdomains to actual servers.  Both groups have a legitimate claim over the name server.  IT needs to make sure that email and other back office systems are properly mapped.  Marketing needs to be able to route external audiences to the right applications. Both groups are afraid of the other group accidentally causing an outage by deleting or updating domain records that they shouldn't be touching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;To work around this problem, I recommend chaining DNS entries across two sets of name servers like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sggottlieb/10932850424/" title="Chaining DNS Entries by sggottlieb, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3809/10932850424_44a9144f1d.jpg" width="500" height="158" alt="Chaining DNS Entries"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this pattern marketing registers a domain for its private use.  What the domain looks like doesn't matter because nobody will see it.  Then marketing sets up DNS entries for public subdomains like www and points them to the IP addresses of the servers or other network infrastructure (like load balancers) that host the sites.  Then the IT group create DNS (CNAME) entries in their name servers that point to the marketing entries.  The end result is that a browser looking for the IP address behind www.example.com will be referred to get its answer from www.examplemktg.com, which will return the correct address. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why is this useful?  If marketing wants to temporarily or permanently move a site onto different hardware, no coordination is needed.  Marketing has full control over what the domain is mapped to.  This may not sound like a big deal but imagine it is 3AM and your primary hosting infrastructure goes down.  &lt;a href="http://contenthere.net/2013/01/monitoring-your-hot-standby.html"&gt;Relief from your disaster recovery setup is just a DNS update away&lt;/a&gt;.  But the IT help desk is offline or can't reach anyone from network operations to make the change.  Your urgent request would just have to wait as audience associates your brand with 500 or Server Not Found errors.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>The CMS Decorator Pattern</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Web content management systems are very good at capturing, managing, and rendering semi-structured content.  They give the contributor tools for controlling the organization of a web site and the layout and composition of pages.  However, when it comes to strictly relational, tabular data, all those features like versioning and preview tend to get in the way.  You wouldn't build a customer relationship management (CRM), enterprise resource planning (ERP), or accounting system on top of a content repository designed to stage and deploy content.  There are better tools for that.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A common pattern when you want to present highly structured, relational data on a website alongside managed content is to manage those data outside the CMS and then use the CMS to organize and augment them.  I have seen this pattern used for years but it didn't occur to me until Will Ezell (from &lt;a href="http://www.dotcms.org/"&gt;dotCMS&lt;/a&gt;) mentioned that this was a direct application of the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern"&gt;Decorator Pattern&lt;/a&gt;.  Until that point, I had mainly used the decorator pattern at the object oriented class level.  Since then, I have been using the phrase "use the CMS to decorate your _______ data."  This description seems to resonate with people even if they are not familiar with the book &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201633612?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=contenthere-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0201633612"&gt;Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=contenthere-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0201633612" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is a concrete example. Lets say that your ERP system is the system of record for your core product data: price, dimensions, materials, manufacturer, weight, distributor, availability, sku and size options.  But these data are dry and not at all compelling to the consumer browsing an e-commerce site.  You can use the CMS to add additional information like a description and photos of the product.  You can also use the CMS to control where the product appears on the website: within a collection of promoted items on the home page; as a featured product on a department page; as part of an email newsletter.  When designing the shopping experience of your customers, the features of a web content management system really come in handy.  You can preview and stage the pages so you can see what they will look like.  You can use scheduled publishing to make the pages go live on a specific date.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From an architectural perspective, the integration does not have to be that complex.  Essentially the content items that decorate your catalog data just have to be aware of a primary key that is managed in your ERP system.  Most web content management systems allow to configure a content editing form to use a database to populate a dropdown box or a more complex browsing interface.  So a user might go into the CMS, create a new "Product" asset and select a Product ID from a dropdown list and then add content to "decorate" that product.  Most CMS rendering engines can read from external data sources.  Once you have that shared key, the assembling of content and data happens at rendering time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is one of those approaches that is so obvious that it is frequently ignored and overlooked. Once you are aware of this pattern and keep it in mind as an option, it becomes much less tempting to overload your CMS implementation to manage data that it was not designed to manage.  The user interfaces can be optimized for specific purposes and your architecture becomes cleaner.  When a content type gets complicated to manage, you should always ask yourself "am I using the right system to manage this data?"&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Study finds coding to be more effective for procrastinating than
blogging</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;It was great to catch up with so many friends at the &lt;a href="http://www.gilbanesf.com"&gt;Gilbane conference in San Francisco&lt;/a&gt; this week.  I spent literally two hours saying goodbye on my way out the door.  One question that I found myself frequently answering was the reason for my recent blogging lapse.  The short answer is that I have been very busy.  But being busy doesn't always keep me from lobbing posts into this blog.  In fact, I often  find myself more compelled to blog when I am immersed in interesting work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The truth is that I occasionally use blogging as a procrastination tool. I blog to avoid important tasks (like writing reports and deliverables) that I can't motivate myself to tackle.  Blogging helps me warm up my brain and prepare me to really think.  I guess when you look at it in that way, I am not procrastinating but preparing; after I publish, I am usually ready to work.  So why the lapse? I have been using a better procrastinating tool.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have taken on some application development work and I have found programming to be a more powerful distraction from my other work.  When I get an idea for a blog post, I write it, publish it, and I am done.  I am ready move on to that deliverable or report.  When I get an idea for how to improve a feature of my application, I get sucked in and have a very difficult time stopping.  There is always something more you can do to improve or extend your code.  Maybe I will get curious about how something works and start exploring.  I blink and 30 minutes have passed.  Video games are the same way.  That is why I don't allow myself to play video games.  But I will never entirely give up programming.  Technologists who do rapidly lose their relevance and limit their options.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on my small survey (sample size: 1), I would say that, other than video games, coding is the most effective tool for keeping you from important writing work (or any other activity for that matter).  Knowing this about myself, I usually take every precaution to avoid programming when I need to write.  When I write my reports (in XML), I make sure to hire someone else to do the XSL:FO work for my rendering templates.  I deliberately started blogging on Blogger because I knew fiddling with a blogging platform would keep me from blogging.  I knew this would happen when I took on this development project but it was so interesting that I couldn't resist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am wondering if there is some neurological explanation for this disconnect between programming and writing: that your programming brain suppresses your writing brain.  My anecdotal observations seem to suggests others struggle with this too.  For example, developers often hate to write documentation.  I don't think that is because of poor writing skills.  Of course, it also be that documentation happens at the end of the project when developers are burned out.  Does anyone else have similar experiences?  What is your most dangerous procrastination device?&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>CMS Gallery on del.icio.us</title>
    <content type='html'>I subscribe to a bunch of open source WCM mailing lists. Occasionally,Â someone announces a new site that he/she built on top of the platform.  When I read this, I usually tag the site on &lt;a href="http://del.icio.us"&gt;del.icio.us&lt;/a&gt; with a tag like &amp;lt;cmsname&amp;gt;gallery.  For example: "bricolagegallery".   Many open source WCM project sites already have nice reference site galleries with descriptions about the technology used.  I find del.icio.us tagging useful for sites that are not on the public galleries.  Here are some tags that you might find useful:&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul id=""&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://del.icio.us/tag/bricolagegallery"&gt;Bricolage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://del.icio.us/tag/daisygallery"&gt;Daisy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://del.icio.us/tag/drupalgallery"&gt;Drupal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://del.icio.us/tag/hippocmsgallery"&gt;HippoCMS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://del.icio.us/tag/ezgallery"&gt;eZ publish&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://del.icio.us/tag/magnoliagallery"&gt;Magnolia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://del.icio.us/tag/plonegallery"&gt;Plone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://del.icio.us/tag/typo3gallery"&gt;Typo3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a reference site that you would like to put up on a CMs project gallery, you should send an email to their mailing list.  If there is no gallery or you just want to put something up right away, tag it in del.icio.us. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>&amp;quot;ZOracle&amp;quot; Part II: The Solution</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;In my &lt;a href="http://contenthere.blogspot.com/2005/12/zoracle-part-i-problem.html"&gt;last post, ZOracle Part I,&lt;/a&gt; I described the requirements and some background on a recent project to rewire an existing &lt;a href="http://www.zope.org/Products/CMF/"&gt;Zope CMF&lt;/a&gt;-based CMS to use an Oracle based relational repository.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I hinted earlier, the key to the solution was an aspect of the existing architecture that placed all of a content assetâ€™s attributes in a structure based on a Zope's &lt;a href="http://www.zope.org/Control_Panel/Products/OFSP/Help/PropertySheet.py"&gt;PropertySheet&lt;/a&gt;.   Each object had multiple property sheets that represented groups of attributes in much the same way &lt;a href="http://www.alfresco.org/"&gt;Alfresco&lt;/a&gt; uses Aspects to allow simple objects to be extended with additional data or capabilities. PropertySheets are normally backed by a &lt;a href="http://www.developer.com/lang/other/article.php/630721"&gt;Python dictionary&lt;/a&gt;, and inherit from Persistent so they get stored in the ZODB when associated with other ZODB persisted objects. What we did was create a new kind of property sheet, called RDBProperties, that was backed by a &lt;a href="http://java.sun.com/blueprints/corej2eepatterns/Patterns/DataAccessObject.html"&gt;Data Access Object&lt;/a&gt; rather than a ZODB persisted dictionary. The DAO encapsulated all the code to read and write from the database. This enabled us to experiment with various database connectivity strategies and do comparative testing (See Part III: Connecting to an Oracle database).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We decided to keep things simple by creating a new database table for every different PropertySheet definition and having a corresponding column for each property. This normalized design was desirable because it made things easier for external applications hoping to make sense of the data. So, if there are 5 asset classes, and 3 possible property sheets to use, there would be three backing tables. We decided to have Oracle manage the primary keys for property sheets with sequences. We stored the unique property sheet ID on the Zope side for retrieval and also captured the Zope-derived object ID in the database so we could reconstruct objects outside of Zope. Other than making sure that we got our data types right and finding a reliable way to talk to the database (see next article), this part of the prototype was pretty straightforward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only problem that remained to solve was when write back to the database. Zope is somewhat elusive in this regard. By design, the programmer doesnâ€™t really know when persistent objects are being written to the database. It just kind of happens in the background. We needed to make sure that we kept the relational database up to date, but we also didnâ€™t want to write to the database too often and create a new performance problem. To do this, we extended Zopeâ€™s transaction manager, TM (Shared.DC.ZRDB.TM.TM), with a new derived class called RDBTransactionManager. This gave us hooks to execute logic at the beginning and end of the transaction (in Zope, a transaction is defined as what happens from the beginning of the HTTP request to when the response is sent. This is different from a database transaction), and also when a transaction is aborted. A new DBTransactionManager is created the first time a DAO is requested and then re-used in each subsequent DAO instantiation within the Zope transaction. Our DBTransactionManager also had a collection (dictionary) of Property DAOâ€™s that were used in the current Zope transaction, so within a transaction, we could cache values and then wait until the end of the transaction to write back to the database (or not, in the case of an abort). At the end of the transaction, the DBTransactionManager iterated through its list of DAOs and called their persist method, and then at the end of it all, called a global commit method which committed the database transaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.jngcommunications.com/seth/simplifiedClass.png" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this design, Zope (actually &lt;a href="http://zopewiki.org/ZEO"&gt;ZEO&lt;/a&gt;) still manages concurrency because, as far as it knows, it still owns the objects. In our tests, Zope still complained when two transactions were trying to update the same object at the same time. The design also worked with multiple ZEO clients talking to the same ZEO database and Oracle database. Search and general object maintenance was also still managed within Zope. Whenever a content asset is stored in the repository, it is indexed with portal_catalog. Also, all of the other functionality of the CMS operated normally - essentially unaware that anything unconventional was happening underneath. Only some rigorous testing can answer the question of whether this improve the performance of the application. It will certainly reduce the size of the ZODB and also reduce the frequency that the ZODB thinks it needs to write data (Zope considers the data contained in the DAO â€œvolatile" and therefore unworthy of persistence). But we did meet the requiremed of data being accessible to any technology capable of accessing an Oracle database.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next: Connecting Zope to an Oracle database&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>NiceEdit</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;If you have a custom web application that does not necessarily need a full CMS but could use a WYSIWYG editor, there are a number of open source Javascript rich text editors out there that are not too difficult to plug in. The big ones are &lt;a href="http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/"&gt;TinyMCE&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.fckeditor.net/"&gt;FCK&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://kupu.oscom.org/"&gt;Kupu&lt;/a&gt;. If you just need something simple, you might consider &lt;a href="http://nicedit.com/index.php"&gt;NiceEdit&lt;/a&gt;. It just has the basics (bold, underline, italics, left/right/center justification, bullets, indent, font size/family, links and images) but it looks easy to install and may be just what you need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content>

    <title>The Onion&amp;#39;s Migration from Drupal to Django</title>
    <content type='html'>There is a great &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/bhvhz/the_onion_uses_django_and_why_it_matters_to_us/"&gt;Reddit thread on The Onion's migration from Drupal to Django.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theonion.com/"&gt;The Onion&lt;/a&gt; was one of the companies that I interviewed for the &lt;a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/77085653/Drupal-for-Publishers"&gt;Drupal for Publishers report&lt;/a&gt;. One of the things I mention in the report is that The Onion was running on an early version (4.7) of &lt;a href="http:drupal.org"&gt;Drupal&lt;/a&gt;. The Onion was one of the first high traffic sites to adopt Drupal and the team had to hack the Drupal core to achieve the scalability that they needed.  While versions 5 and 6 of Drupal made substantial performance improvements, The Onion's version was too far forked to cleanly upgrade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Still, The Onion benefited greatly from using Drupal. They were able to minimize up-front costs by leveraging Drupal's native functionality and adapt the solution as their needs changed. Scalability was a challenge but it was a manageable one.  Even though forking the code base was not ideal, it was a better alternative than running into a brick wall and having to migrate under duress.  The Drupal community also benefited from the exposure and learning that came from The Onion using Drupal.  Everybody won &amp;amp;mdash how often can you say that?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I can understand the choice of &lt;a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/"&gt;Django&lt;/a&gt; 1.1 (current) over a hacked version of Drupal 4.7.  Having built sites in both Drupal and Django, I can also see the appeal of using a Django over Drupal 6.16 (current). Django is a more programming-oriented framework and The Onion has programmers.  &lt;a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/h6v521138njm2062/"&gt;Django is designed to be as straightforward and "Pythonic" as possible&lt;/a&gt;. Drupal tries to make it possible to get things done without writing any code at all; and &lt;a href="http://www.yelvington.com/content/first-rule-coding-drupal"&gt;if you can avoid writing code in Drupal, you should&lt;/a&gt;. As a programming framework, Drupal has more indirection and asserts more control over the developer.  The Onion's staff of programmers clearly appreciate the programmatic control that Django affords and they are quite happy with their decision.</content>

    <title>Great presentation on content modeling</title>
    <content type='html'>Deane Barker, over at &lt;a href="http://www.gadgetopia.com"&gt;Gadgetopia&lt;/a&gt;,  has posted slides from &lt;a href="http://www.gadgetopia.com/post/6853"&gt;his presentation "Just put that in the zip code field"&lt;/a&gt;.  He gave the talk at the &lt;a href="http://www.webcontentconferences.com/chicago/"&gt;Web Content 2009 conference in Chicago&lt;/a&gt;.  Unfortunately, I was not able to attend the conference and missed seeing Deane present.  However, knowing that I am as passionate about this stuff as he is, Deane and I did talk at great length on content modeling during the days leading up to the conference.  Oh, the war stories we told.  Those conversations inspired me to write this post on &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2009/06/pages-and-objects.html"&gt;pages and objects&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The reason why I find this topic so important (aside from the fact that I am a recovering DBA myself) is that content modeling capability is  one of those difficult to change characteristics of a content management system.  It is what I call a "load bearing wall" in the customization of a CMS. That is, while it may be possible to remediate a content modeling limitation, all the buttressing required may make such an effort impractical.  Content modeling architecture is so difficult to change, in fact, that the products themselves tend to live with what they have and change very little in this area.  Products that do change how they model content usually take a while to stabilize as they work out the nuances of how to generate entry forms and validation routines and the appropriate templating syntax to access the elements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because of all this, content modeling is a critical part of my CMS selection process.  Part of my demo process requires the suppliers to implement a content model specification that is based on the client's own content.  Deane's presentation also gives useful tips on what to look for in a CMS.  In particular, I look for the ability to support specific data types and structures.  Don't know what that means?  Then take a few minutes and click through Deane's &lt;a href="http://www.gadgetopia.com/post/6853"&gt;presentation&lt;/a&gt;.  Or, better yet, look for an opportunity to see Deane present it live.  You might see me there too.</content>

    <title>Gearing up for JBoye 08</title>
    <content type='html'>I am just starting to get geared up for &lt;a href="http://jboye08.dk/"&gt;jboye08&lt;/a&gt; next month.  The &lt;a href="http://jboye08.dk/program"&gt;conference program&lt;/a&gt; is still being finalized but you can't go wrong with the great speakers that they have lined up.  So far, I am locked in to do a tutorial on open source and to participate in a panel on selecting a CMS.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note to jboye delegates who are U.S. citizens:&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;em&gt;You will be out of the country on election day so you should apply for an absentee ballot (unless you plan to vote for the wrong candidate).&lt;/em&gt;  I just sent off for mine.  The site &lt;a href="http://www.govoteabsentee.org/index.php"&gt;Go Vote Absentee&lt;/a&gt; made the process easy.</content>

    <title>The Significance of Recovery.gov on Drupal</title>
    <content type='html'>Last week, I read &lt;a href="http://buytaert.net/obama-using-drupal"&gt;Dries's announcement about the recovery.gov site running on Drupal&lt;/a&gt;.  I also though that was pretty cool but not worth a blog post.  Instead I just &lt;a href="http://delicious.com/sggottlieb/drupalgallery"&gt;cataloged it as an interesting Drupal site&lt;/a&gt;.   Last night my friend &lt;a href="http://greg.abstrakt.ch/"&gt;Gregor Rothfuss&lt;/a&gt; sent me a &lt;a href="http://geekfun.com/2009/02/20/why-recoverygov-may-be-just-the-beginning-for-open-source-in-federal-it/"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; that helped me realize what a big deal this is.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When I dismissed the news, I wasn't thinking about how wasteful government is when dealing with all things technical.  Several years ago, I did a project for the Department of Defense as a sub-sub-contractor.  After weeks of meetings and general non-productivity, the net result was to replace a horrible looking and un-useful departmental website with a very small static HTML website (that we knew would never be updated).  Of course, this was all cloaked in grandiose language of knowledge management and eGovernment.  It was pretty clear throughout the project that the contractors wanted to milk this thing for all that they could.  The project left me feeling pretty lousy as a tax payer.  But, I figured things could be worse.  Websites don't kill people - this one didn't anyway.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flash forward to present day and the Obama transition team...  I can just imagine the &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/7ydzp/the_white_house_used_the_opensource_drupal/c07r6le"&gt;disruption of technologies like Drupal are having within the government&lt;/a&gt;.  But the biggest change to the status quo might not just the technology is free (as in liberty and beer).  This could be an opportunity to look past the old guard of consultancies (like &lt;a href="http://www.boeing.com/"&gt;Boeing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.utc.com/"&gt;United Technologies&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.saic.com/"&gt;SAIC&lt;/a&gt;) that are draining public coffers because they know how to play the game.  Hopefully the game has changed so that new ideas and energy can help drive the infrastructure of the government towards greater efficiency.</content>

    <title>Kindle needs a &amp;quot;lend&amp;quot; button</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Whenever &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; announces news about it's Kindle product, like with the &lt;a href="http://www.dailyfinance.com/story/media/amazon-cuts-kindle-price-as-e-reader-battle-heats-up/19525058/"&gt;recent Kindle price drop&lt;/a&gt;, I find myself referring to my &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2009/03/how-i-talked-myself-out-of-a-kindle.html"&gt;reasons for not buying a Kindle&lt;/a&gt;.  So far they are working out pretty well for me.  The strongest argument has been the inability to share (first on the list).  When I buy a physical book, which is usually not much more expensive than the digital version, I don't just buy the ability read the book myself.  I am also buying something that I can share with others.  Frequently I mention a book to someone and grab my copy to lend.  And roughly half of the books that I read are on loan from others.  You don't get this experience from a digital book and I would miss it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Personally, I would reconsider my decision not to buy a Kindle if it had a "lend" feature.  Here is how it would work.  If I owned a digital copy of a book, I could click a "lend" button that would bring up a list of my friends.  I would be able to set the length of the loan.  During that period, the lendee would have access to the book but I would not.  As the owner of the book, I could retrieve the book and, in doing so, remove it from the lendee's library.  This feature could also be enabled for public and academic libraries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This move would be great for Amazon (or a competitor that did it first).  It would encourage people to buy the reader device when their friends buy one.  It makes the reader more valuable and viral.  It would alleviate feature/function competition.  You would buy the reader your friends have, not the flashiest product with the best C|Net review.  Publisher's would probably not be so keen on the idea.  They would see fewer eBook sales.  I think this issue could be addressed by Amazon increasing the digital copy price and sharing more revenue with the publisher.  For reference books and classics, the publisher could see sales to people who borrowed the book but wanted their own copy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This reminds me of Kevin Kelly's classic post "&lt;a href="http://www.kk.org/thetechnium/archives/2008/01/better_than_fre.php"&gt;Better than Free&lt;/a&gt;," where he lists characteristics of content that make it worth paying for.  One of the characteristics is "Embodiment," which digital content lacks.  Making a digital edition virtually transferable (and not copyable) would certainly add embodiment because it would make it behave more like a physical asset.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon (or any other digital reader maker): please steal this idea (if you haven't already thought of it yourself).  I would really like to see lending digital content happen.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Doubt</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;After collecting requirements, the second most difficult component of a CMS selection is taking all the information that was gathered during the evaluation phase and using it to make a decision.  This is where people get crazy with spreadsheets and scoring in the hopes that &lt;em&gt;math&lt;/em&gt; will somehow heroically make a complicated and confusing (and, lets face it, subjective) decision obvious and irrefutable.  The process looks something like this... There are a bunch of selection criteria. People rate the products on each criterion.  People weight the criteria.  You do some multiplication and addition and out comes some very quantitative looking numbers.  Nothing looks more convincing than a score where one option has more points than another.  But, users don't necessarily want to use a system just because it has the highest cumulative, weighted score.  They want to use a system that helps them efficiently get their jobs done while introducing the fewest number of annoyances.   if the measurement of accuracy is the overall satisfaction with the solution, this method is extremely faulty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are several reasons why the matrix scoring method fails to accurately select the right solution. First, the rating and weighting wind up being very subjective and arbitrary.  Veterans of this approach know this to be true when the they remember the feeling of not knowing what to put down or wanting to change their score when they see another product or have more coffee.  Second, the final score hides information that is important to the users.  A typical example is where a user finds a very important (to him) feature totally unusable but that is overshadowed by excellent ratings in a bunch of less important features.  Usually you can't correct this with weightings - especially if there are lots of selection criteria.  You can't discuss trade-offs and compromises if you are just working with total scores.  Lastly, criteria tend to be of unequal granularity.  How can a broad criteria like "usability" be compared with something as specific as "SSL on the login page?"&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sggottlieb/3398492532/" title="Bogus Selection Matrix by sggottlieb, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3462/3398492532_e158ba5cc1.jpg" width="500" height="226" alt="Bogus Selection Matrix" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I take a different approach to the decision making process.  Instead of forcing the selection committee into making numerical ratings, I ask them to list their doubts with each solution.  Examples of doubts are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;a concern that the feature would not support a specific task&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;unnecessary complexity or awkward behavior in doing a specific task&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;an unsatisfactory explanation by the supplier about how a feature worked&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;doubt about the vendor's stability or ability to support the customer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;a potential technical incompatibility with the legacy infrastructure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Each of these doubts are investigated as whether they are valid (that is, if it was a misunderstanding or oversight), if there is a suitable work-around, or if there is a reasonable compromise.  Through some facilitated sessions, we work through comparing the relative weaknesses of the competing solutions and determining what is tolerable.  Follow up demos and calls with the vendors are scheduled and executed.  Ultimately, the solution with the fewest legitimate and significant concerns wins.  Facilitating these sessions is not as easy as simply reporting matrix scores but I think that it is good that people put some real intellectual energy into making such an important and complex choice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first glance, this system seems designed for selecting the lesser of evils and to some extent that is true - there is no such thing as a perfect solution and there will always be compromises (I should note here that there is an option of selecting nothing if no solution is good enough) - but it is really no worse than a numerical system that decides a 5 out of 1000 score is better than 3 out of a 1000.  The benefit of the doubt technique is that it keeps the focus on things that have real impact on users and forces users to think through the implications of specific aspects of the solution.  This is better than having a user register their concern as low numerical score and then just moving on.  A secondary benefit selection committee members learn about their needs and software features as they watch demos and their selection criteria becomes more sophisticated.  This approach allows potentially important information to enter the decision making process at any time.  Also, after the product is selected, the selection committee can all clearly verbalize the reason behind the decision.  If there is a complaint about the implemented solution, a selection committee member can say that they identified it as a concern and then explain the plan to lessen the impact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I will be discussing this technique as well as all the other components of my CMS selection methodology in my &lt;a href="http://gilbanesf.com/workshops.html#workshopa"&gt;"How to Select a Web Content Management System" workshop&lt;/a&gt; at the upcoming &lt;a href="http://gilbanesf.com"&gt;Gilbane Conference in San Francisco (June 2-5, 2009)&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>Semantic tagging on the cheap with a WYSIWYG editor</title>
    <content type='html'>I am surprised by how few companies employ the little trick of using the WYSIWYG editor in their CMS to semantically tag rich text fields.  The general idea is that you overload the WYSIWYG CSS support by using the CSS classes with semantically meaningful names.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is an example.  Lets say you are publishing a business journal and you write a lot about &lt;em&gt;companies&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;regulatory agencies&lt;/em&gt;.  You might have a sentence like &lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apparently, following an investigation into the hacking of several dozen customer accounts, the &lt;em&gt;SEC&lt;/em&gt; found &lt;em&gt;LPL&lt;/em&gt; negligent.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p align="right"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.informationweek.com/blog/main/archives/2008/09/sec_fines_wall.html"&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The terms "SEC" and "LPL" are italicized in compliance with your style guide.  To satisfy the style guide, your reporter probably just highlights the text and clicks the italics button.  But, what if your style guide changes to say that company names are bolded and your regulatory agencies are in red text?  Using style classes would give you much greater flexibility than "em" and "strong" tags.  Most WYSIWYG editors can be configured to have a drop down list of style classes.  When a user highlights the text and selects the class, the WYSIWYG editor writes it as a span tag with that class:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&amp;lt;span class="classname"&amp;gt;LPL&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now what should you name your classes?  Here is the trick.  Rather than call them "italics" or "bold" or "red," give them names to indicate the &lt;em&gt;meaning&lt;/em&gt; of the text that you are styling: such as "company" and "regulator."  In addition to giving more flexibility in styling, you will be able to do some really interesting things with your content. For example:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;With a very simple XSL template you can have your rendering template put a list of mentioned companies and agencies on the page.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You could extend the logic of your CMS to automatically create metadata about the article to help your search engine figure out that your article is about &lt;em&gt;Apple&lt;/em&gt; computers rather than &lt;em&gt;Motts&lt;/em&gt; Brand Apple Juice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You could have your rendering templates insert the stock symbol of the company or create a link to their ticker page.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The possibilities are really endless when your programming logic has access to the &lt;em&gt;meaning&lt;/em&gt; of your content.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using a WYSIWYG editor to do simple semantic tagging is not the only way to add meaning to your content.  You can have your authors write in an XML editor.  You can use a text mining engine match words against a centrally managed controlled vocabulary.  However, I have found that this approach is the least expensive, most practical way to get started.  They &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to have their article look nice.  This approach captures that intent and, with no additional effort, creates additional value that your author  (at first) is less aware of.  Once your content starts to have semantic tagging and your technology starts to leverage it, your authors will probably start to see the benefits and really get excited about the possibilities.  &lt;br /&gt;</content>

    <title>Publishing to mobile is more execution than platform</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Mobile publishing functionality is becoming an increasingly important requirement for web content management (WCM) selections and I am starting to hear more customers ask "can this product do mobile?"  The fact is, most WCMS have that core functionality built into their DNA since multi-format publishing has been going on since the beginning of time.  In the early days it was publishing "printer friendly" versions, PDFs, portlets, or RSS (&lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2011/03/designing-for-mobile.html"&gt;we only dreamed of mobile&lt;/a&gt;).  Now we are talking layouts and navigation that are optimized for smaller screens.  In fact, what differentiates a WCMS from a document management system is the "rendering" or "presentation" tier that takes structured content and applies a layout template to generate a formatted output.  The specific purpose of the rendering tier is to be able to reuse content and publish to different formats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just because nearly all WCMSs have the foundation to support a decent experience for a mobile user, it doesn't mean mobile will come easily to your solution.  Why? Because WCMSs are also very flexible and give you plenty of opportunity to shoot yourself in the foot.  WCMSs allow you to model your content with enough structure to make it reusable, but they don't require it.  You can still use a single generic content type and turn your WCMS into a &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2006/10/the-6-million-dollar-wysiwyg-editor.html"&gt;6 million dollar WYSIWYG editor&lt;/a&gt;.  You can fail to &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2010/07/keeping-your-content-dry.html"&gt;keep your content DRY&lt;/a&gt;.  If you committed these sins, your mobile project is when they will come home to roost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While structured, reusable content is a key to success in mobile and nearly all WCMSs support some degree of content modeling, there are a few non-universal features that will make supporting mobile easier.  Look out for these features when evaluating WCMSs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Configurable template selection rules.&lt;/strong&gt; All WCMS should be able to associate presentation templates to content types.  You should look for a platform that allows you to configure template selection rules based on criteria like the section of the site or the user agent (browser).   Otherwise, you need to build complex switching logic into your display templates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Themes&lt;/strong&gt;.  A theme is a collection of templates that define a comprehensive style (layouts, behavior, font, palette, images, etc.) of the site.  A theming model allows you to group templates that are used for a style.  This makes themes interchangeable and selectable so you can manage a mobile theme (or multiple mobile themes for different devices).  It is particularly helpful if the platform allows themes to override each other &amp;mdash; similar to cascading style sheets.  For example, you could have a base theme and specific themes that override selective elements of the base theme.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multi-site content sharing&lt;/strong&gt;.  Designing for mobile is not limited to layouts and styling.  There is growing consensus around the value of having a separate site with content that mobile visitors are likely to want.  This doesn't have to be fresh, mobile-only content.  Rather, it is a subset of the main content with a simplified navigation.  Some WCMSs will represent this mobile area as a different "site." Others will represent it as a folder in the hierarchy.  Regardless of the semantics, you need to be able to have the same piece of content exist in both of those places at once.  Different WCMSs use different metaphors to allow contributors to manage these placements: "locations," "aliases," "references."  Some metaphors come more easily to contributors than others but all contributors need training to get it right.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;True preview&lt;/strong&gt;. Editors will want to see how the content is going to look on different devices before publishing.  Some WCMS come with emulators that allow you to see a page as if it being accessed by a mobile device.  I don't know how accurate these emulators are but they are probably good enough.  If the WCMS does not have an emulator, you need some way to access that preview from another device.  This can be complicated if the preview is not behind a readily accessible URL that you can point the device to.  Some WCMS run preview off of the user's session data (the draft is not stored in the repository until it is deliberately saved).  This will be a problem because mobile testing device will be in a different session.  Some WCMS architectures (mainly baking-style systems) have a full site staging area.  This makes it easier to run through a whole site of pre-published content from your mobile device.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those are the key CMS features to look for.  The rest is in the execution.  In addition to content modeling, make sure you are working with a competent designer than knows mobile and web developers that know how to implement the design to make pages lightweight (for example: compressing HTML, CSS, and Javascript; using sprites for buttons and logos; and effective placement of script references to prevent blocking).  Also don't forget to account for increased testing.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>In-Context Review: Know the Power of Your CMS</title>
    <content type='html'>I am blogging again (sort of). &amp;nbsp;Here is a&lt;a href="http://content.lionbridge.com/context-review-know-power-cms/"&gt; post I wrote on the Lionbridge Blog about reviewing content in your CMS&lt;/a&gt;. Crazy. I know. But you would be surprised how many people think you should be reviewing content outside of their CMS.</content>

    <title>Syndicating your feelings</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;img src="http://wefeelfine.org/common/movements/madness.jpg"/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://wefeelfine.org/index.html"&gt;We Feel Fine&lt;/a&gt; "is an exploration of human emotion on a global scale."  The site scans the blogosphere for phrases like "I am feeling" or "I feel" and presents these results in this really cool user interface. The site has &lt;a href="http://wefeelfine.org/movements.html"&gt;6 Movements&lt;/a&gt; (Madness, Murmers, Montage, Mobs, Metrics and Mounds) that show different visualizations of these data.  For example, in the Madness movement, "Each particle represents a single feeling, posted by a single individual. The color of each particle corresponds to the tone of the feeling inside â€“ happy positive feelings are bright yellow, sad negative feelings are dark blue, angry feelings are bright red, calm feelings are pale green, and so on. The size of each particle represents the length of the sentence contained within. Circular particles are sentences. Rectangular particles contain pictures." &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an interesting use of feeds and a powerful way to visualize lots of data.  I could see this as an effective tool for companies that have successfully adopted blogging within the enterprise and are now struggling for a way to take a pulse on what their employees are saying and feeling.</content>

    <title>Follow up on Mac Subversion clients</title>
    <content type='html'>A few weeks ago I wrote a post &lt;a href="http://blog.contenthere.net/2008/07/mac-svn-clients.html"&gt;introducing two new Mac Subversion clients&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href="http://www.zennaware.com/cornerstone/"&gt;Cornerstone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://versionsapp.com"&gt;Versions&lt;/a&gt;.  After the free trials expired I chose Cornerstone and have been pretty happy with it.  I tend to use Cornerstone as a file browser when I am working with a straight text editor (like &lt;a href="http://macromates.com/"&gt;TextMate&lt;/a&gt;).  From there I can browse around my working copy, open files, and see changes against the most recent from the repository.  The user interface is very clean and presents useful information clearly.  When I am working in Eclipse, it is hard to resist the convenience of &lt;a href="http://subclipse.tigris.org/"&gt;Subclipse&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Interestingly, the main reason why I switched from &lt;a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/"&gt;TextWrangler&lt;/a&gt; to TextMate was its project browsing functionality.  Now Cornerstone plays that role for me - at least for anything I have in source control, which is everything.  However, I have gotten used to TextMate so I think I will stick with it.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a while, I struggled with Cornerstone's performance.  It seemed to consistently hang as it tried to scan the file system for changes.  This was resolved by changing a preferences setting: Preferences -&amp;gt; Working Copy -&amp;gt; Refresh Working Copy = "Manually."  Now it only checks the working copies when I ask it to (with command-r).  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="thumbnail"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skitch.com/sggottlieb/iur5/cornerstone-annotated"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.skitch.com/20080910-kj66wcwqfhib3149n5cpwr4ws2.preview.jpg" alt="Cornerstone-annotated" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Lucida Grande, Trebuchet, sans-serif, Helvetica, Arial; font-size: 10px; color: #808080"&gt;Uploaded with &lt;a href="http://plasq.com/"&gt;plasq&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="http://skitch.com"&gt;Skitch&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing you may notice in the screen shot above is that it shows Cornerstone looking at the source code from my website.  A lot of people ask me what web content management system I use.  Well, the answer is none.  Because my website is so small and I am comfortable with source control, HTML, and FTP, I really don't need one.  My website as 13 pages.  A web content management system is like a web page factory.  You don't build a factory to produce 13 units.  Of course, that may change when I hire that flashy marketing executive with the wafer-thin laptop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use &lt;a href="https://www.panic.com/transmit/"&gt;Transmit&lt;/a&gt; as my FTP client.  It has a nice little feature called "Drop Send" that allows you to drag a file onto the Transmit icon in your doc (from Cornerstone or your Finder) and it automatically puts it in the right place (thanks for the tip &lt;a href="http://dizzytree.com/2008/04/26/tip-textmate-and-transmit-ftp/"&gt;dizzytree&lt;/a&gt;).   If you want an all-in-one alternative to the TextMate/Transmit/Cornerstone combo, you might try &lt;a href="http://www.panic.com/coda/"&gt;Coda&lt;/a&gt;, which seems to do it all like Adobe Dreamweaver (without the WYSIWYG but $300 cheaper).  The latest version of Coda (1.5) has a SVN client. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content>

    <title>InfoGlue shows some life</title>
    <content type='html'>I was just catching up on some of the open source web content management platforms that I track and noticed the new &lt;a href="http://www.infoglue.org/"&gt;InfoGlue site&lt;/a&gt;.  Around a year and a half ago I had given up on InfoGlue because so little had happened.  Then I saw &lt;a href="http://cmf2007.dk/speakers/dang_huu_cu"&gt;Dang Huu Cu's cmf2007 presentation&lt;/a&gt; on the United Nations Development Programme Vietnam's use of InfoGlue.  Still, very little was happening on the project at the time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While, I wouldn't say that InfoGlue is thriving, There appears to be some life in the project.  They put up a new release (2.9.3) in this September and the site looks much better.  They will be &lt;a href="http://www.infoglue.org/News/News_detail/?contentId=1066"&gt;holding an online conference on Monday October 13th&lt;/a&gt;.</content>

    <title>Shortened URLs and spam filters</title>
    <content type='html'>One of the more frustrating things about email these days is spam filtering.  It stinks to miss important messages that your spam filter thought you shouldn't see.  It is even worse when your message gets caught by someone else's spam filter.  The latter case makes you paranoid whenever someone doesn't get back to you.  You start thinking "did he get my message? Should I send it again?"&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just this morning, a spam filter rejected and sent back one of my emails with the following text:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Heuristic analysis has classified your e-Mail as spam and delivery has been refused.  We apologize if your message was misinterpreted.  Please check your entire message for any restricted content and then attempt a resend. You may also request addition to our list of pre-approved senders.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"Heuristic analysis" was probably an overstatement. It was probably just looking for keywords.  But what could I have written in my email about scheduling a business meeting that would have triggered the rejection?  Well, I am relatively certain that the issue is this....  In my email signature (and, in this case, the body too) &lt;a title="Business Time" href="http://www.contenthere.net/2008/10/business-time.html"&gt;I have a shortened link (is.gd) to my Google calendar so that the recipient can see when I am free&lt;/a&gt;.  Personally, I thought this was a great idea because I work with clients who use Exchange or other groupware to schedule meetings when everyone is free.  This technique allows the meeting organizer visibility into my calendar without my needing to join their calendaring system.  I used a shortener because the link is really long.  I use plain text emails so the length of the URL matters to me.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I still think exposing my calendar is a good idea so I figured out a work around.  Google allows you to embed a calendar in another page so I just embedded it in page on &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net"&gt;http://www.contenthere.net&lt;/a&gt; that can easily be linked in an email.  I am hoping this will lead to a drastic reduction in spam accusations.</content>

    <title>CMS Architecture: Managing Presentation Templates</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Another geeky post...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my last post, &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2010/01/cms-architecture-managing-content-type-configurations.html"&gt;I described the relative merits of managing configuration in a repository vs. in the file system&lt;/a&gt; but excluded presentation templates even though how they are managed is just as interesting.  Like configuration, presentation templates can be managed in the file system or in the content repository.  Like with configuration, if you manage presentation templates in the repository, you need some way to deploy them from one instance of your site to another without moving the content over as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of additional reasons why you would want to manage presentation templates on the file system.  In particular, presentation templates are code and you want to be able to use proven coding tools and techniques to manage them.  Good developers will be familiar with using a source code management system to synchronize their local work areas and branch/tag the source tree.  Development tools (IDE's and text editors) are designed to work on files in a local file system.  If you manage presentation templates in the repository you have to solve all sorts of problems like branching and merging and building a browser-based IDE or integrating with local IDEs.  The latter can be done through WebDAV and I have also seen customers use an Ant builder in Eclipse to push a file with every time it has changed.  Still, the additional complexity can create frustrating issues when the deployment mechanism breaks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As much as it complicates the architecture, there is one very good case when you would want to manage presentation templates in the repository: when you have a centralized CMS instance that supports multiple, independently developed sub-sites.  For example, lets say you are a university and each school or department has its own web developer that wants to design and implement his own site design.  This developer is competent and trustworthy but you don't want to give him access to deploy his own code directly to the filesystem of the production server.  He could accidentally break another site or, worse, bring down the whole server.  You could centralize the testing and deployment of code, but that would just create a bottleneck.  You could do something like put the CSS and JS in the repository and have him go all &lt;a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/"&gt;CSS Zen Garden&lt;/a&gt;, but sooner or later he will want to edit the HTML in the presentation templates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this scenario of distributed, delegated development, presentation templates are like content into two very important aspects:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;presentation templates need access control rules to determine who can edit what.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;presentations templates become &lt;em&gt;user input&lt;/em&gt; (and &lt;a href="http://www.cmswire.com/cms/web-cms/how-they-hack-your-website-overview-of-common-techniques-002339.php"&gt;user input should never be trusted&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second point is really important.  Just like you need to think twice when you allow a content contributor to embed potentially malicious javascript into pages, you need to worry that a delegated template developer can  deploy potentially dangerous server side code.  Once that code is on the filesystem of an environment it can create all sorts of mischief. It doesn't matter if it was intentional or not, if a programmer codes an infinite loop or compromises security, you have a problem.  Using templating languages (like Smarty or Velocity) rather than a full programming language (like PHP or Java in JSP) will mitigate that risk but you still have to worry about the developer uploading a script that can run on your server.  With staging and workflow, CMSs are good at managing semi-trusted content like presentation templates from distributed independent developers.  There is a clear boundary between the runtime of the site and the underlying environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your CMS uses file-system based presentation templates and you delegate sub-site development to the departments who own them, you should definitely put in place some sort of automated deployment mechanism that keeps FTP and SSH access out of the developers hands and reduces the potential for manual error.  The following guidelines are worth following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Code should always be deployed out of a source code system (via a branch or a tag).  That way you will know what was deployed and you can redeploy the same tested code to different environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Deployments should be scripted.  The scripts can manage the logic of what should be put where.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Every development team should have an integration environment where they can test code.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of my clients uses a product called AnthillPro for deployments of all web applications and also presentation templates.  It has taken a while to standardize and migrate all of the development teams but now I don't see how you can have a de-centralized development organization without it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other dimension to this problem is the coupling between the content model and the presentation templates.  When you add an attribute to a content type, you need to update the presentation template to show it (or use it in some other way).  The deployment of new presentation templates needs to be timed with content updates.  Often content contributors will want to see the new attribute in preview when they are updating their content.  Templates also need to fail gracefully when they request an attribute that does not yet exist or has not been populated yet.  Typically, presentation templates evolve more rapidly than content models.  After all, a change in a content model usually involves some manual content entry.  In my scenario of the university, there is a benefit of centralizing the ownership of the content model.  This allows content sharing across sites: if one department defines a news item differently than another department, it is difficult to have a combined news feed.  Centralizing the content model will further slow its evolution because there needs to be alignment between the different departments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wow, two geeky posts in a row.  I promise the next one will be less technical.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>11 Content Management Wishes for 2011</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I don't generally write (or even read for that matter) upcoming year prediction posts.  They seem more for the benefit of industry watchers than practitioners in the trenches.  This, I know: some vendors will flourish; others will get acquired; early adopters will believe themselves to be leading lasting trends; many of them won't be; many employees will be frustrated that their companies are not following these trends; the rest of the world will take little notice.  Now onto my hopes for the new year.  I wish these things not just for the trendsetters but for everyone working in content management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I hope that &lt;strong&gt;expertise follows the technology.&lt;/strong&gt;  We have seen a trend of corporate web publishing moving out of the Information Technology group and into the Marketing department.  This is great but I haven't seen marketing departments develop the talent to manage these technologies.  People in marketing don't have enough experience hiring and managing technical people, enforcing engineering rigor, and buying technology services.  This is particularly problematic because the content management products they are buying have a huge upside if you understand how to implement and maintain their sophisticated features.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I want &lt;strong&gt;"Creative Developer" to emerge as the dominant role in most web teams.&lt;/strong&gt;  I have had the pleasure of working with some talented people who are good enough with design, HTML, CSS, AJAX and can also hold their own on a software development team.  They can maintain their own development environments, can get around a command line, can pick up server-side coding, and have a genuine interest in engineering.  For a while I got spoiled and didn't have an idea of how rare these individuals are.  I would like to see this skill set become the norm rather than the exception.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I want &lt;strong&gt;analytics to become a core competency.&lt;/strong&gt;  Nearly all companies practice web analytics but very few have achieved the level of mastery it takes to leverage this information.  Setting and striving for metrics-based goals isn't baked into the culture.   Traffic trends are more of a curiosity rather than a call to action.  Typically companies are smartest about analytics immediately after purchasing a product and sending a team member to training.  Then the intelligence decays as other operational aspects take priority or the person leaves.  Often I see companies on the market for a new analytics system when they could do just as well by retraining on their current system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wish everyone  would &lt;strong&gt;dump IE6 support.&lt;/strong&gt;  Can we just do this already?  By continuing to support IE6, we are not only wasting money and stifling innovation but we are also enabling companies to force their employees to use outdated, insecure technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wish &lt;strong&gt;technology companies would get more sustainable.&lt;/strong&gt;  The current pattern for technology companies is to: 1) burn lots of cash to build a product; 2) build a user base; 3) cash out by being bought by some other company.  Customers are drawn in during phase 2 and then &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2010/02/why-cms-vendor-acquisitions-are-bad-for-customers.html"&gt;get screwed in phase 3&lt;/a&gt;.  We see this in enterprise software (Vignette, RedDot, Merant) and in consumer software and services too (most recently with Delicious).  Knowing this, I prefer solutions that I can see a sustainable business model from the start.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I want a &lt;strong&gt;focus on content strategy to become the norm.&lt;/strong&gt; Last year was big for content strategy. The field has been gaining awareness and key visionaries are starting to emerge.  My hope is that this discipline continues to be incorporated into standard business practices. Teams need to start with the content rather than the container.  We will know we are close when we stop seeing &lt;a href="http://www.lipsum.com/"&gt;lorem ipsum&lt;/a&gt; in wirefames (another blog post I need to write).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wish for the &lt;strong&gt;return of the corporate librarian.&lt;/strong&gt;  Too many companies believe that they can buy technology to play the role of a corporate librarian.  Rather than invest time to organize and curate information, they leave it where it is and hope enterprise search will find it.  The problem is that there winds up being so much duplicated content that the search engine can't effectively prioritize and recommend what it should in a search result.  Either every knowledge worker needs training in basic library sciences, or companies need corporate librarians to help teams organize and share their information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I hope the &lt;strong&gt;social intranet gets real.&lt;/strong&gt;  Up until recently companies have been operating under the myth that if you launch an internal Facebook, employees will jump in with the same enthusiasm that they poured into the real thing.  That hasn't happened and it isn't going to happen.  Nobody wants to invest their entire social being into their employers system where it only can be seen by co-workers.  However, I think the social intranet concept has more legs than its predecessor which was to create a shared corporate brain (repository) that employees would voluntarily dump all their knowledge into and be able to leverage when they needed it.  All the science says that knowledge and learning doesn't work that way.  People learn by experience.  The learning happens faster with immediate feedback.  Someone else's feedback is almost as good as the natural feedback from a good or bad decision.  If the social intranet can simply connect people who are learning skills with people who have been through the learning process, there will be huge returns.  The challenge is to align the rewards to create a culture that prioritizes those types of exchanges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I hope &lt;strong&gt;publishers develop a sustainable web business model.&lt;/strong&gt;  The foundation of the web is interconnectedness.  Visitors bounce around from site to site and share links with each other.  Traditional publishing has focused on building a captive audience &amp;mdash; getting the full attention of a customer and renting some of that attention to advertisers.  That is easier to do with a paper magazine or newspaper in hands of a person in a comfy chair than it is in a browser under the control of an attention challenged, click-happy web user.  Publishers either need to either figure out away to monetize a non-captured audience or re-capture their audience.  Apps and pay walls (the current infatuations of publishers) attempt the latter but they take the publisher out of the web ecosystem.  I don't think that is going to work over the long term.  This problem is more than a year away from getting solved but I would like to see some progress during 2011.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I hope &lt;strong&gt;Net Neutrality is preserved.&lt;/strong&gt; I am getting dangerously close to industry-watcher territory here, but the threat to net neutrality really concerns me.  It wouldn't be a problem if there was real competition between internet service providers, but most consumers have only 1 or 2 broadband service options.  If the government is going to allow (and enable) these monopolies to exist, it has a responsibility to regulate this overly monopolistic behavior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I hope &lt;strong&gt;content professionals continue to be passionate about their craft and earn their place in upper management.&lt;/strong&gt;  In order for that to happen, we will need to realize the rhetoric of content as a strategic asset.  This means demonstrating how better content management can make businesses more effective and competitive.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you can see, we all have our work cut out for us.  Get some rest over the next couple of days and get ready for 2011.  I expect great things from you all!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Happy holidays.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Daniel Jacobson on de-coupled publishing systems</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Daniel Jacobson, &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org"&gt;NPR's&lt;/a&gt; Director of Application Development, has an excellent article on the philosophy of &lt;a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2009/10/13/cope-create-once-publish-everywhere/"&gt;de-coupling the content management tier from the delivery tier&lt;/a&gt;.  He calls this strategy COPE: Create Once Publish Everywhere.  In particular, the diagram is particularly useful in showing how all the pieces fit together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are in the content publishing business (like NPR is), this is absolutely how you need to think about your content technology stack.  Your content repository, editorial systems, and distribution channels can get sophisticated and highly specialized so compromise and lock-in can be costly.  The delivery tier that came with your content management system may not scale or may not allow you to push the cutting edge if an opportunity to innovate should arise.  All of my big name publishing clients have adopted this strategy for their core publishing platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, as I have warned in earlier posts, &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2006/12/area-architect-dreams-of-model-architecture.html"&gt;the flexibility may not be worth the cost for all publishers&lt;/a&gt;.  Unless your business model depends on aggressively leveraging your content and you can afford to play on the cutting edge, a lighter weight "website in a box" style architecture may give you the flexibility you need without the additional complexity and cost of building and integrating these de-coupled systems.  As an example, &lt;a href="http://drupal.org"&gt;Drupal&lt;/a&gt; is rapidly becoming a popular platform for small to medium publishers and also for smaller initiatives in larger publishers.  And you cannot get a tighter coupling of management and delivery tier than Drupal.  One strategy that has been used by early Drupal adopters (that have grown out of their forked versions of the platforms) is to use Drupal to publish into a custom delivery tier. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an architect, I love the COPE model and I think that most successful, large scale content businesses will eventually converge on that strategy.  However, as a pragmatist who also serves publishers in the lower and middle tiers of the industry, I know that the resources and expertise may not be available to go straight to that architecture.  Still, at the very least, every publisher needs to start thinking on this level: creating and storing content in presentation neutral way to keep options open.  &lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Web Techies Use Chrome and Firefox</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Last week I put up an &lt;a href="http://liox-web-pm.appspot.com/"&gt;experimental job application form for a technical web project manager&lt;/a&gt; [for some more explanation, see my post &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2012/08/an-unconventional-approach-to-recruiting.html"&gt;An Unconventional Approach to Recruiting&lt;/a&gt;].  So far, I have been getting some great results that I will share in the near future.  One preliminary finding that you might consider interesting is what browsers and operating systems people were using.  Special thanks to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/timothydavis"&gt;Timothy Davis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BradFry"&gt;Brad Fry&lt;/a&gt; for the Google Analytics help. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;60% of the successful submissions were from Windows computers.  40% were from Macs.  Nobody submitted from a Linux machine.  I did get some Linux traffic though.  Perhaps, the role was not interesting to these visitors.  14% of the site traffic was from iOS devices but I don't know if it is possible to submit the form from iOS.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For browsers, 75% of the successful submissions used Chrome; 25% used Firefox. I didn't get any submissions from Internet Explorer or Safari users.  I am not surprised that most of the submissions were from Chrome and Firefox.  The tools that you need to solve the problem are built in.  But IE also has this feature.  Safari comes with it but you need to enable it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you include traffic to the whole site (which includes the form), the breakdown is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;tr&gt;&lt;br/&gt;       &lt;th style="text-align:left;font-weight:bold"&gt;Browser&lt;/th&gt;&lt;br/&gt;       &lt;th style="text-align:left;font-weight:bold"&gt;% Visits&lt;/th&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;tr&gt;&lt;br/&gt;		&lt;td&gt;Chrome&lt;/td&gt;&lt;br/&gt;		&lt;td&gt;53.16%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;tr&gt;&lt;br/&gt;		&lt;td&gt;Firefox&lt;/td&gt;&lt;br/&gt;		&lt;td&gt;13.92%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;tr&gt;&lt;br/&gt;		&lt;td&gt;Mozilla-compatible agent&lt;/td&gt;&lt;br/&gt;		&lt;td&gt;13.92%&lt;/td&gt; 	 	&lt;br/&gt; 	&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;br/&gt; 	&lt;tr&gt;&lt;br/&gt; 		&lt;td&gt;Internet Explorer&lt;/td&gt;&lt;br/&gt; 		&lt;td&gt;12.03%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;br/&gt; 	&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;br/&gt; 	&lt;tr&gt;&lt;br/&gt; 		&lt;td&gt;Safari&lt;/td&gt;&lt;br/&gt; 		&lt;td&gt;5.06%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;br/&gt; 	&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;br/&gt; 	&lt;tr&gt;&lt;br/&gt; 		&lt;td&gt;Android Browser&lt;/td&gt;&lt;br/&gt; 		&lt;td&gt;1.90%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;br/&gt; 	&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;/table&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;IE and Safari users were hitting the site, they were just not willing or able to complete the form.  There are a number of hypotheses that could explain this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The profile that would be attracted to solving this puzzle would also be the type to install a browser of his/her choosing rather than use the one that came with the operation system.  I will leave it at that and skip the value judgments :).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;Internet Explorer users are surfing from work and wouldn't want to be seen applying for a job.  Of the IE users, 58% were on IE8 and lower.  That might be a clue that people are at their work computers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;Internet Explorer users are all happily employed and wouldn't even consider applying for a job.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;The data sample is not big enough to make any conclusions.  We are in the early stages of this experiment so I don't have a lot of data.  I will keep it running and see if anything changes. &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;As usual, I am interested in hearing your thoughts here in the comments or on the social web.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>The Importance of Vendor Neutrality</title>
    <content type='html'>I was just reading &lt;a href="http://www.cmswatch.com/Commentary/"&gt;CMS Watch Commentary&lt;/a&gt; today and noticed Alan Peltz-Sharpe's &lt;a href="http://www.cmswatch.com/Trends/1010-Uncle-Sam-cracks-down-on-vendor-selection-abuse?source=RSS"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; about the Department of Justice suing &lt;a href="http://www.accenture.com/"&gt;Accenture&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;"&gt;allegedly&lt;/span&gt; (who are we kidding, we KNOW they did it!) colluding with a software vendor and recommending the product based on kick-backs.  See &lt;a href="http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2007/04/gov_sues_accent.html"&gt;full story&lt;/a&gt;. These are the times it feels very good to be a vendor neutral technology strategy consultant.  The collusion between systems integrators (and some large analyst firms) ranges from trivial to flagrant.  Even if there are no monetary kickbacks on a software deal, there is usually some kind of bias. A systems integrator (or more accurately, individuals on a sales team) is going to pitch the product that they know best in order to reduce their risk. In fact, you don't necessarily want a systems integrator to propose a solution that they are going to learn on your billable time. Software vendor partnerships may exert pressure to prioritize a certain solution. My recommendation would be to accept that systems integrators are biased (that they &lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;need&lt;/span&gt; to be biased) and put their recommendation within that context.  Maybe talk to a couple of SI's that specialize in different products. Or, better yet, talk to someone like &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/"&gt;Content Here&lt;/a&gt; who can afford to be vendor neutral and have them connect you with the right technology &lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;"&gt;and &lt;/span&gt; the right integrator.  There's my bias talking!  Seriously, it was probably foolish for the Department of Justice to expect an unbiased recommendation from Accenture. I just hope they didn't waste too many tax dollars buying it.</content>

    <content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://sippey.typepad.com/filtered/2006/02/dumbing_it_down.html"&gt;Michael Sippey has a nice post&lt;/a&gt; annotating Tom Coates' slides on the &lt;a href="http://www.plasticbag.org/archives/2006/02/my_future_of_web_apps_slides.shtml"&gt;future of web apps&lt;/a&gt;.

I think there are some good takeaways for the future of content in a Web 2.0 world.</content>

    <title>Homebrew CMS</title>
    <content type='html'>I have seen (and replaced) enough home-grown content management systems to know that they are not as easy to build as you would think.  As a software architect, I understand the temptation.  You just want something simple and you don't want to put up with all the compromises,  limitations, and cost that a CMS framework comes with.  After all, its just a matter of writing some data to the database and then presenting that same data elsewhere.  We have all designed dozens of systems that do that!  And look!  You can even download a free WYSIWYG editor to make your homebrew CMS usable?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But before you go ahead and build the one billion and first CMS, here are some things that typically burn generalist architects when they try to design their first CMS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Versioning.&lt;/span&gt;  Frequently, the single requirement that kills a custom CMS is versioning - especially if it is added in after the initial design.  Versioning is hard.  It is hard because it makes your data model more complicated. It is hard because it is a concept that most generalist architects haven't implemented before.  There are all of these interesting nuances like how often to create a new version (with every save, or every time it is published?) or the need to link to a specific version of an asset or just the latest version.  If you want to get an idea just how hard versioning is, look at &lt;a href="http://plone.org"&gt;Plone&lt;/a&gt;.  They have been trying to build versioning into the core for years (&lt;a href="http://osdir.com/ml/web.zope.plone.versioning/"&gt;see Plone Versioning Mailing list&lt;/a&gt;).  Finally, in the upcoming 3.0 release, Plone will have versioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Localization.&lt;/span&gt;   Localization isn't just about Unicode.  It is a whole other dimension of of your content repository.  While adding versioning doubles the complexity of a data model, versioning combined with localization makes chaos if you are not careful.  Does each translation have multiple versions?  Or does each version have multiple translations?  What language do you fall back to if you don't have a translation of an asset in the requested language?   What is the relationship between the URLs of the translated sites?  How do your presentation templates handle it when text runs right to left or up and down?    Do all of the attributes of an asset need to be translated or can some things (like images) be shared?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Preview.&lt;/span&gt;  Authors love preview.  They like to see what their content is going to look like on the rendered page before everyone else sees it.  The higher the fidelity the preview has, the better.   Sometimes, just looking at the rendered detail page is enough.  Other times, users want to be able to navigate through a full preview environment to see how the asset appears as related links on other pages and even search results.  To deliver serviceable preview, you are going to need different presentation environments and versioning.  Otherwise, every time the user clicks save on a published asset, the live site will update.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Deployment and dependency management.&lt;/span&gt;  Content, especially web content is interrelated.  Pages reference images and have links to other pages.  If you are going to deploy a piece of content to the presentation tier, what will you do if the related assets are not ready for publishing and/or not deployed?  Would you even know? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Usability.&lt;/span&gt;  While the content management market cannot claim to have mastered usability, they have probably spent more time refining their user interfaces than you can afford to.  Usability is probably the most common reason why companies abandon their home grown CMS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Access control.&lt;/span&gt;  Most software systems are designed to manage access control by function, not by data.  Most (although definitely not all) content management systems have figured out a manageable system for controlling permissions around data.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are never going to have any of these requirements, go ahead. Write your own CMS.  Just be prepared to throw it away when you grow out of it.  Better yet, use frameworks and components that already deliver these key services.   For example, a JCR compliant content repository will support most of these core repository services (check-in, check-out, versioning, workspaces).  A workflow engine will help you keep ever changing workflow definitions out of your code and in a more manageable definition format.  Also, look at lots of products out there and try to understand the reasons behind their design.  What you see now in these products probably reflects years of evolution driven by requirements that you face now or will someday in the future.</content>

    <title>What it takes to be a senior engineer</title>
    <content type='html'>John Allspaw (SVP of Technical Operations at Etsy) recently published an excellent article about what it means to be a senior engineer: "&lt;a title="On Being a Senior Engineer" href="http://www.kitchensoap.com/2012/10/25/on-being-a-senior-engineer/"&gt;On Being a Senior Engineer&lt;/a&gt;".  It's long but worth every word.  It made me think of all of the colleagues that I worked with over the years. It also made me think of how little justice the title "Senior Engineer" does to this role.  When recruiters look for senior engineers or senior software developers, they are basically asking for coders with some experience - perhaps on their second job out of college.  Developers expect this title as a birthright after putting in a few years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Allspaw's definition calls for characteristics that not everyone will acquire no matter how many years on the job.  It makes me wonder if it would be more practical to use a different name for the role rather than redefine a term that most people use differently.  The problem with the word "senior" is that it implies that it is part of a normal growth path.  While I would love this to be the case, my experience is that most developers are not heading in that direction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another thought that I had is that most companies under-appreciate the role of senior engineer.  Perhaps their businesses do not require need these talents.  Maybe it is sufficient to have a project manager working with a number of non-senior developers.  I would say that all web and software companies should definitely appreciate and cultivate this role.  But does a bricks and mortar company with a commerce site on the side need a senior engineer?  If not, what happens if the non-senior engineer starts to develop senior traits?  Does she change jobs or do you move her out of software engineering to a pure management role?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anyway, I thoroughly enjoyed the article.  It really made me think about recruiting and careers in technology.</content>

    <title>Magnolia: Be back soon!</title>
    <content type='html'>I just read Boris Kraft's post on &lt;a href="http://betterfasterbigger.blogspot.com/2008/10/losing-magnoliainfo.html"&gt;losing the the Magnolia.info domain.&lt;/a&gt;  I have had that happen to me (for a personal site) but never with these consequences.  If they can't get their domain back, they will move to magnolia-cms.com - which I think is a better domain anyway.  A .com or .org is easier to remember (says the guy with a .net domain).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best of luck to the Magnolia team in getting their website back and a reminder to everyone else that they should stay on top of their domain registration!</content>

    <title>IBM focuses on Drupal</title>
    <content type='html'>My colleague &lt;a href="http://menoza.org/"&gt;Ben Menoza&lt;/a&gt;, just passed on &lt;a href="http://drupal.org/node/73159"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;a href="http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/ibm/library/i-osource1/index.html?ca=drs-"&gt;IBM Developer Works analysis&lt;/a&gt; of open source and cheap software to build a community website.  They looked at &lt;a href="http://drupal.org"&gt;Drupal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/"&gt;Ruby on Rails&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.mamboserver.com/"&gt;Mambo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.typo3.org/"&gt;Typo3&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.sixapart.com/movabletype"&gt;Movable Type&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://wordpress.org/"&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://textpattern.com/"&gt;TextPattern&lt;/a&gt;.  Based on their requirements, Drupal came out ahead.  In particular, they recognized ease of installation, shallow user learning curve, user management, the community, and the flexible theme framework.</content>

    <title>CM Pros Spring Summit</title>
    <content type='html'>I am looking over the &lt;a href="http://summit.cmpros.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=Page.viewPage&amp;pageId=624"&gt;program for the CM Professionals Spring 2008 Summit&lt;/a&gt; (June 17th in San Francisco) and am really impressed with the lineup. This event seems to get better every year.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The topic is "Dynamic Delivery Across Multiple Media Channels" and there is  also a healthy dose of web 2.0 and social media content.  The one day event is broken up into two tracks (business and technical) and attendees will need to make some hard choices.  For example, do you see &lt;a href="http://www.welchmanconsulting.com/christine.htm"&gt;Christine Pierpoint&lt;/a&gt; describing &lt;a href="http://summit.cmpros.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=Page.ViewPage&amp;PageID=625#1a"&gt;governance in a Web 2.0 world&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.wyona.com/people/michael-wechner/index.html"&gt;Michael Wechner&lt;/a&gt; talking about &lt;a href="http://summit.cmpros.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=Page.ViewPage&amp;PageID=625#1b"&gt;integrating Open Social&lt;/a&gt;?  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either way, you can't go wrong.  Plus, it only costs $395 to &lt;a href="http://summit.cmpros.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=Page.viewPage&amp;pageId=626"&gt;register&lt;/a&gt;.  $1,795 gets you into the &lt;a href="http://gilbanesf.com/registration_information.html"&gt;Gilbane Conference&lt;/a&gt; (always a fun event) and an &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodtouch/"&gt;iPod Touch&lt;/a&gt; as well.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content>

    <content type='html'>I&amp;#39;m not sure I believe in &amp;quot;designers&amp;quot; any more than you believe in &amp;quot;casual CMS users&amp;quot;. :)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the most successful projects I&amp;#39;ve been involved in, we don&amp;#39;t have visual designers. We have user experience designers. They will certainly start in Photoshop to get visual direction from the client. But our designers are all user interface people first and visual designers second. The visual design is driven by a careful analysis of what users actually do with the system, starting from personas and use cases.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The designers also understand how the web works (e.g. the limitations of HTML, cross-browser concerns etc), and how CMS&amp;#39;s work (e.g. the need for content-managed elements to be markup, not images, and the implications for what you can achieve in the design).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The next step from Photoshop is normally UI prototyping, using a tool such as Axure. This is then tested on real users. The idea is to see how the design helps users achieve realistic tasks. For a low-budget alternative, I&amp;#39;ve also used Mockingbird (http://gomockingbird.com)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once this is complete, the PSD + prototype are turned into an HTML template. I find that having a &amp;quot;plain HTML&amp;quot; template is invaluable. Building anything straight in the CMS tends to cause the design to fall apart in a way that is difficult to counteract. A canonical, cross-browser-tested HTML template gives everyone a common starting point. In many cases, it has also proved useful in other integration work. (In Plone now, we also use tools like XDV or Deliverance which means that applying a plain-HTML template to the CMS is quite easy.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course, the designs and prototypes also become the starting point for more technical implementation work, which is normally specified and prototyped in parallel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Martin</content>

    <title>Drupalcon DC 2009 Sessions Online</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;For those of you (like me) who missed &lt;a href="http://dc2009.drupalcon.org/"&gt;Drupalcon in DC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://dc2009.drupalcon.org/news/almost-all-session-videos-drupalcon-dc-now-online"&gt;videos from 90 sessions have been posted online&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23drupalcon"&gt;By all accounts&lt;/a&gt; this was an amazing conference and I am sorry to have missed it. At least, I will be able to catch some of the sessions online.  In particular, I am interested in:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://dc2009.drupalcon.org/session/drupal-newsroom-mother-jones-new-york-observer"&gt;Drupal in the Newsroom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://dc2009.drupalcon.org/session/drupal-7-whats-done-whats-coming-and-how-you-can-help"&gt;Drupal 7: What's done, what's coming, and how you can help&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://dc2009.drupalcon.org/session/staging-and-deployment-panel-discussion"&gt;Staging and Deployment - A Panel Discussion&lt;/a&gt; (no video posted yet)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://dc2009.drupalcon.org/session/intro-simpletest"&gt;Intro to SimpleTest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://dc2009.drupalcon.org/session/protect-your-site-hackers-introduction-security"&gt;Protect your site from hackers: Introduction to Security&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>eZ Publish Fork?</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/73/195771045_cb4ab353f1.jpg"/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/malinky/195771045/"&gt;Image credit: Malinky on Flickr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://sandro.groganz.com/"&gt;Sandro Groganz&lt;/a&gt; just tweeted a link to &lt;a href="http://blog.coomanskristof.be/2009/01/31/ez-publish-to-fork-or-not-to-fork/"&gt;Kristof Coomans's proposal of a community fork of eZ Publish&lt;/a&gt;.  Kristof is about to be a former employee of &lt;a href="http://ez.no/company/ez_crew/belgium"&gt;eZ Systems Belgium&lt;/a&gt; and seems to be quite frustrated with eZ's lack of progress and openness with the platform.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To me, this is unfortunate news.  &lt;a href="http://ez.no"&gt;eZ Systems&lt;/a&gt; has been making a lot of progress in the media and publishing industry and (to me at least) been improving the platform nicely.  &lt;a href="http://www.prlog.org/10054697-ez-systems-the-creator-of-ez-publish-goes-to-chicago.html"&gt;eZ Systems has also successfully established a beach-head in the United States&lt;/a&gt;.  I think the one area that they have been lagging is their initiative to port &lt;a href="http://ez.no/ezpublish"&gt;eZ Publish&lt;/a&gt; onto the &lt;a href="http://ez.no/ezcomponents"&gt;eZ Components&lt;/a&gt; framework.  It would be a shame if the great energy behind this platform were to be fragmented into two competing projects - especially as eZ Systems is poised to &lt;a href="http://ez.no/developer/forum/general/ez_project_v_five"&gt;do a major rewrite&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Still, I am not panicking yet.  For now, I am just filing this as a frustrated employee rant.  It takes much more than a rant to start a successful fork.</content>

    <content type='html'>Hi Seth  -  this is an old discussion but I think its helpful to me, I have some questions about Intranet sites.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am a web designer and recently developed a website for a client that is hosting the site in house on an Ubuntu server which the installed specifically for this Wordpress site.  Everything else is hosted on a Windows server. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;People in house viewing the website with IE are finding a formatting problem with thumbnail images on portfolio pages which is due to the fact that all the workstations are set to &amp;quot;Display intranet sites in compatibility mode&amp;quot; enabled.  When that setting is disabled, the formatting problem disappears.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My question is why would this corporate internet site be considered an intranet site? Are all websites hosted in house called intranet sites?   Is there a way to configure it so it is not seen as an intranet site?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I appreciate any insight you might share.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks!&lt;br&gt;Anne Pouch</content>

    <title>Communicating Across the Techno Gap</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;You have probably heard people talking about "dotted lines" in organizational charts.  That is when someone has partial accountability to someone other than his direct manager.  An org chart notation that I would really like to see is a "flashing red" line.  I would use it to show when someone reports to a manager who has no clue what he does.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any reader of Dilbert knows that this happens all over organizations but the case that I am the most keenly aware of is when a technologist reports to a non-technologist (or, perhaps worse, a former technologist).  As a consultant, this is the area where I am regularly deployed.  I am often hired by the non-technical manager to help him validate and/or understand what his technical staff are doing.  I am also often hired by the technical staff to validate and explain their strategy.  Consultants get put into this position because this is an area where companies struggle on their own.  They need an outsider to facilitate and verify because communication and trust is so compromised.  While I do love this work and would be happy to perform this role at your organization, here is some free advice to get you started so you can make some progress on your own.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Communicating to a non-technologist&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your manager doesn't really understand what you do despite your best attempts to explain it.  You suspect that he doesn't care.  Maybe he doesn't want to understand.  Maybe he can't help that his brain just locks up when you say words like "refactor."  You don't feel appreciated.  You are about to stop trying.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When talking to your non-technical manager, don't try to dumb down what you say but for every detail mention, make a very clear connection to something that matters to the business.  That usually means cost (short term and long term), quality, and impact.  By impact, I mean things that will benefit the business: time savings, competitive advantage, etc.  Provide inputs for any financial analysis he wants to do.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don't get bogged down in numbers.  Instead, draw comparisons because the units are probably meaningless.  At the end of the day, the non-technical manager wants to be reassured that progress is being made and nobody is making "unconventional" technology decisions.  An example of the former, is saying that you are "doubling  storage" rather than "adding a 500GB RAID 5 storage array."  For the latter, say "companies like EBay use MySQL" rather than "MySQL is a fully ACID compliant database."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;More important than anything you say is how you listen.&lt;/em&gt;  Listen to his concerns.  Figure out what kind of proof will alleviate these concerns and provide it.  Prototyping is a great way to show a technology in terms that a non-technical person can relate to - much better than UML.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Communicating to a technologist&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Admit it. You are a little afraid of your tech guy.  He has strange working habits and speaks in a language that you only barely understand.  Even though you manage him, you have very little visibility over what he does.  Unlike with other people who report to you, your advice to him is pretty much worthless because you both know that you have no idea what you are talking about.  Whenever you ask a question, the answer just confuses you more.  You just stop asking.  The scariest thing you can think of is that your tech person leaves and, after drifting helplessly for weeks, you learn that your entire infrastructure is in chaos and about to collapse.  What is going on in this technical empire he has built under your nose?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you don't know anything about technology, you should start learning.  Unless you are retiring in the next couple of months, you can only expect technology to become a more important part of the business that you are supposed to run.  Have your technology guy help educate you.  Ask him about the technical details underneath what you see as a user.  But don't just listen to your internal technology people, listen to what is happening outside of your organization.  Talk to your peers at other companies and learn about what they are doing.  Read stuff online.  Hire a &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/about"&gt;good consultant&lt;/a&gt;. Share what you are learning with your technical staff in a non-confrontational way.  Don't go in with managerial bravado.  You are the student - be humble.  It is a warning sign if they get defensive when you show a genuine interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best approach for making technology decisions is to describe what you need in very clear terms (your technical person will call that requirements gathering).  &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2008/11/leading-requirements.html"&gt;I like usage scenarios as a way to communicate these things&lt;/a&gt;.  Ask your technical staff to put together their best solution and schedule time to review its viability and sustainability.  Have an open dialog about the implications.  Meet regularly with the team - not just at the end to "sign-off."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;More important than anything you say is how you listen.&lt;/em&gt;  Treat the interaction not as manager but as a partner and teammate.  You both have the same goals.  When the technical discussion gets out of your depth, &lt;em&gt;don't shut down!&lt;/em&gt;  Instead, connect it to something that you do understand and that matters to your responsibilities.  Share the insight that you have about the company's needs and what your boss will ask for. &lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Content Management as a Practice</title>
    <content type='html'>A few weeks ago Deane Barker from &lt;a href="http://blendinteractive.com/"&gt;Blend Interactive&lt;/a&gt; wrote a &lt;a href="http://gadgetopia.com/post/6507"&gt;thought provoking post about content management as a practice&lt;/a&gt;.  Deane and I started talking about this idea in June when we were in Chicago for &lt;a href="http://webcontent08.com"&gt;Web Content 2008&lt;/a&gt;.  I understand why Deane took a few weeks to write up a post.  This is a big idea that lots of people have struggled with.  To summarize, it is not that hard to build a team of people who understand how to implement a specific platform and translate requirements into configuration and customization of that solution.  It is harder to build a team of people who understand the foundational concepts in the abstract (that is, not tied to any vendor's implementation) and know how different implementations perform in different situations.  (that is probably an overly brief summary.  You should definitely read Deane's &lt;a href="http://gadgetopia.com/post/6507"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; and the follow up comments).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To understand content management at this level you need to experience lots of different products, tease out concepts and patterns, and do a lot of comparative thinking.  This is hard to do because it takes a certain kind of curiosity that I find surprisingly rare and certainly expensive to cultivate.  Most people stop looking when they see something that works.  They find it frustrating and risky to ignore familiar concepts to look at a problem from a fresh perspective.  They dread the steep initial incline of a learning curve.  They only suffer suffer through in the hope of flatter pitches ahead.  Few have an insatiable need to challenge and be challenged.  The instant the learning curve starts to level-off, they are looking for another one to run up against.  They like the feeling of being dropped into a totally unfamiliar place and finding their way.  You can't carry too many (TADD: Technical Attention Deficit Disorder) people like this on staff because nothing gets done the same way twice.   To build a successful content management practice (that balances predictability with innovation), you need both types of people.  You need some people that are constantly searching and challenging and you need others plowing ahead on well traveled paths.  I don't know what that perfect balance is and there are plenty of companies that do very well by picking a repeatable solution and getting very good at efficiently implementing it.  You can try to supplement your own exploration by buying research but I feel that most industry analysts don't go deep enough into the solutions to really understand them and have useful things to say.  I think most of what you get is some quick (often misguided) observations and some unsupported theories presented as trends.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To take the conversation one step further, I would go on to say that "content management" is too broad and ill-defined to base a discrete consulting practice.  "Content" is a squishy term - really no more descriptive than the word "stuff." Every software application manages some kind of data that (&lt;a href="http://blog.contenthere.net/2008/05/content-is-not-data.html"&gt;depending on the perspective&lt;/a&gt;) could be considered "content."  Even within the accepted segment of content management, the different disciplines of web content management, digital asset management, digital records management, and document management have so little common ground.  Ever sit through a discussion with a DITA evangelist and a marketing communications person whose idea of content is a press release written in Word?  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the biggest issue is that content management (in of itself) &lt;em&gt;is not a business problem&lt;/em&gt;.  Media companies need help creating rich content experiences for their audiences.  Consulting companies need to improve the way they collaborate to produce and re-use deliverables.  Manufacturing companies need to organize and bundle specifications for their products and the supporting end-user documentation.    Marketing organizations need a destination to point their various campaigns.  All companies need at least a few pages on the web to communicate to the market what they do.  Content is just a common thread through these different business problems that it takes different skills and approaches to solve.  As content management professionals we should not get so distracted by the fact that there is "content" involved that we lose focus on the business goals that are to be achieved.  This is where industry specialization is important.  I think it is more important for a consultant to understand best operational practices for a specific industry than generalized practices in content management.  There may be commonalities in how technical documentation and news articles are managed but how much does that really matter to the customer who is only concerned with their manuals or publications?  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What really hammered point home for me was at a wedding last weekend.  I am used to getting blank stares when I say that I "help companies select and leverage content technologies."  This time I said "I help media and publishing companies select and leverage technologies to manage the content of their websites."  Everyone instantly got it and I had some great conversations with people who either worked in media businesses or were just interested consumers of media.  I could have said that "I help select and leverage technologies for e-commerce companies to make their websites more effective selling tools.  That is also true.  It is OK to specialize in more than one thing (I also work in the high-tech and entertainment industries).  The key is to focus on the customer's higher level business objectives, not a set of capabilities that defines a software market segment.  Yes, an understanding of workflow as a foundational concept is useful but even more important is to understand the different editorial processes that happen within a news organization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is a fascinating topic and I hope the discussion continues.  Please comment here, on Deane's blog, FriendFeed, Delicious.  You name it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content>

    <title>Apache Software License, Hippo, and BlueNog</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;When I first got interested in open source software there was a lot of talk about the restrictions and liberties of various licenses and the risk that free-riders posed to the system.  I have to admit that I never found these topics very interesting and usually referred the conversation to my colleague &lt;a href="http://stephesblog.blogs.com/"&gt;Stephen Walli&lt;/a&gt; (who is way more qualified in this area than I am &amp;mdash; &lt;em&gt;lawyers&lt;/em&gt; even listen to him!).  For the most part, these (as well as the whole indemnification and &lt;a href="http://www.sco.com/"&gt;SCO&lt;/a&gt; hysteria) have turned into non-issues, particularly for my clients who are users of the software and will probably never read a license anyway.  Things tend to work themselves out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But every once in a while, something interesting in the topic of licenses does pop up.  You may remember I wrote a post describing how &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2008/09/bluenog-subtly-forks-hippo.html"&gt;Bluenog took Hippo CMS, slapped their logo on it and sold it as commercial software&lt;/a&gt;.  Well, they are still at it and they have even gone further as to remove any acknowledgement that they are repackaging someone else's software.  The &lt;a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0"&gt;Apache Software License&lt;/a&gt;, which Hippo CMS uses, is very permissive and only requires that redistributions of the software contain a notice file giving credit to the original developers.  Bluenog isn't even doing this.  And, as you would probably expect they are not contributing back to Hippo either.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bluenog is clearly in violation of Hippo's licensing terms so it may not matter what license Hippo is distributed under, but it did get me thinking about licenses again.  The Apache Software License has been used very successfully for infrastructural components like the famous &lt;a href="http://httpd.apache.org/"&gt;Apache HTTP Server&lt;/a&gt; and all those great Java frameworks and components.  The key benefit there is achieving broad adoption.  The terms are so generous that there is virtually no downside to including an Apache licensed component in your software.  Adoption is a good thing for frameworks and components because lots of users help find bugs and help the project move forward.  Even if a very small percentage of developers contribute back, the scale of the user base translates into a lot of support.  This low barrier to adoption is particularly good for reference implementations of standards.  &lt;a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/"&gt;Tomcat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/slide/"&gt;Slide&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://jackrabbit.apache.org/"&gt;JackRabbit&lt;/a&gt; were all critical to the success of the standards they promoted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As good as the ASL is for components and frameworks, I question its efficacy for business applications.  Business applications, like Hippo, compete in a different market than infrastructure.  They are going after a smaller (higher touch) install base and they are more actively competing against other products.  Business applications need to innovate and differentiate from their competitors while infrastructure wants to be stable and standard.  The potential for free-riders to undermine your investment to be unique is too great.  This is why most other CMS on the market are licensed under the GPL or a similar license.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From a consumer perspective, it feels like Bluenog customers are getting ripped off.  They are buying a software application that should be free.  Customers are essentially paying Bluenog to ask questions on the Hippo mailing list that Hippo and the community are answering for free.  It feels like Bluenog's refusal to acknowledge Hippo is an attempt to protect this arbitrage.  Had customers worked directly with Hippo, they would not only save money, they would also know that Hippo has an entirely new product: &lt;a href="http://www.onehippo.org/cms7/"&gt;Hippo CMS 7&lt;/a&gt; that is a ground up rewrite from the 6.x series that Bluenog forked.  I do think that this issue will eventually be worked out.  Bluenog will probably not be able to continue practicing business in this manner: even if lawyers don't get involved.  But, as you can probably tell, this drama does rankle my developer and open source sensibilities.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Making Sense of the ECM Market</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Alan Pelz-Sharp has a &lt;a href="http://www.cmswatch.com/Feature/138-Enterprise-Content-Management"&gt;nice article&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="http://www.cmswatch.com"&gt;CMS Watch&lt;/a&gt; about trends in the ECM market.  In this article, Alan (I think rightly) points out that ultimately the large infrastructure plays (Microsoft, EMC, IBM) are going to gobble up the space "managing unstructured data just the same as they currently manage structured data."  The article goes on to say that acquisition may not be a bad thing because it may lead to more investment into the platform and better support.  That is a likely scenario unless one of these giants acquires multiple platforms and lets all but their favorite wither away (for a while this is what was happening at divine when it had both Content Server and Participant Server). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most insightful observations in the article is that the impending roll-up may lead the large ECM players, in anticipation of being acquired one day, to ignore the small and medium enterprise because these clients will not mean anything to the potential acquirers.  Rather than risk being underserved by the large ECM vendors, Pelz-Sharp suggests Small and Medium Enterprises to consider Best of Breed products, including Open Source, that can "solve pressing problems in a simpler fashion."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good point.  I hadn't thought of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Flexibility. It&amp;#39;s a matter of perspective.</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;In my many years of collecting requirements for content management systems, I can't think of a single project where the word "flexibility" wasn't on the initial list of requirements.  This "requirement" seems harmless enough.  What could be wrong with the system being flexible?  Flexibility seems like the perfect thing to ask for when you don't really know what you want.  But it's a trap.  Here is why.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone who hears the word "flexibility" takes it to mean "being able to do whatever &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; want with the platform."  But what that means depends on who you are and what you are personally capable of.  For example:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you are a content creator, "flexibility" may conjure up an image of MS PowerPoint where you can make text boxes and pictures wherever you want on the page.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you are a web designer, you might imagine being able to edit pages as if they were static HTML where you could write whatever markup, CSS, or Javascript that you wanted. And every page could be a unique creation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you are a print designer, you might picture editing one big image in Photoshop where you have precise control over every pixel and don't have to worry about annoyances like browser support or different displays.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you are developer might think about structured data that is re-usable and can be controlled by display template logic.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The interesting thing is that these expectations are usually mutually exclusive.  The content producer's unstructured PowerPoint document is garbage to a template developer who whats to make global changes or adapt the display of the content for different contexts and audiences. The structured content model and display templates are inflexible to the content producer who doesn't know HTML and doesn't have access to develop and test code.  An image produced by a graphic designer is a black box to anyone who doesn't have the source file and the right software to edit it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And this is why everyone consider's their current CMS inflexible and tries to prioritize flexibility the next time around. But the process just repeats itself again and again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first step to breaking out of this cycle is to strike the term "flexibility" from the conversation entirely.  Every time someone says the word, he needs to put a dollar in a jar.  You can't move forward together if your interpretations of a word are diverging.  After that, start talking about "balance of control" as in who controls what on the page.  Stake out your territories. This doesn't have to be a land grab. Have mature discussions about control vs. responsibility and the ongoing maintenance implications of these decisions. Educate each other about your different perspectives.  Talk through scenarios of what might need to change and who should need to participate in that change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, you should avoid thinking in absolutes like "flexible" or "inflexible."  When you talk about balance of control, you are more likely to have productive discussions about moving boundaries rather scraping the whole system because it is "inflexible."&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>CM Professionals Gets New Executive Director</title>
    <content type='html'>CM Professionals will be getting a new Executive Director (&lt;a href="http://www.cmprofessionals.org/about-cm-pros/news/scott-abel-named-executive-director-of-cm-professionals"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;).  &lt;a href="http://www.thecontentwrangler.com/"&gt;Scott Abel&lt;/a&gt; is a human dynamo and I am so happy that he will be filling this role.  Executive Director is a paid part time position so Scott will have even more time to dedicate to CM Professionals.  This also opens up more slot on the Board of Directors: a one year term.  The &lt;a href="http://www.cmprofessionals.org/about-cm-pros/organization/elections"&gt;election process&lt;/a&gt; is just starting.  So if you are interested in helping shape the future of the organization and the Content Management discipline, you should throw your metadata into the ring.</content>

    <title>NoSQL Deja Vu</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Around thirteen years ago, I helped build a prototype for a custom CRM system that ran on an object database (ObjectStore).  The idea isn't quite as crazy as it sounds.  The data was extremely hierarchical with parent companies and subsidiaries and divisions and then people assigned to the individual divisions.  It was the kind of data model where nearly every query had several recursive joins and there were concerns about performance.  Also, the team was really curious about object databases so it was a pretty cool project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One thing that I learned during that project is that (at least back then) the object database market was doomed.  The problem was that when you said "database," people heard "tables of information."  When you said "data" people wanted to bring the database administrator (DBA) into the discussion.  An object database, which has no tables and was alien to most DBAs, broke those two key assumptions and created an atmosphere of fear, uncertainty and doubt.  The DBA, who built a career on SQL, &lt;a href="http://browsertoolkit.com/fault-tolerance.png"&gt;didn't want to be responsible for something unfamiliar&lt;/a&gt;.  The ObjectStore sales guy told me that he was only successful when the internal object database champion positioned the product as a "permanent object cache" rather than a database.  By hiding the word "data," projects were able to fly under the DBA radar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to the present and it feels like the same conflict is happening over &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL"&gt;NoSQL databases&lt;/a&gt;.  All the same dynamics seem to be here.  Programmers love the idea of breaking out of old-fashioned tables for their non-tabular data.  Programmers also like the idea of data that is as distributed as their applications are.  Many DBAs are fearful of the technology.  Will this marginalize their skills?  Will they be on the hook when the thing blows up?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don't know if NoSQL databases will suffer the same fate as object databases did back in the 90's but the landscape seems to have shifted since then.  The biggest change is that DBAs are less powerful than they used to be.  It used to be that if you were working on any application that was even remotely related to data, you had to have at least a slice of the DBA's time allocated to your project.  Now, unless the application/business is very data centric (like accounting, ERP, CRM, etc.), there may not even be a DBA in the picture.  This trend is a result of two innovations.  First, is object relational mapping (ORM) technology where schemas and queries are automatically generated based on the code that the programmer writes.  With ORM, you work in an object model and the data model follows.  This takes the data model out of the DBA's hands.  The second innovation is cheap databases.  When databases were expensive, they were centrally managed and tightly controlled.  To get access to a database, you needed to involve the database group.  Now, with free databases, the database becomes just another component in the application.  The database group doesn't get involved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that the database is a decision made by the programmer, I think non-relational databases have a better chance of adoption.  Writing non-SQL queries to modify data is less daunting for a programmer who is accustomed to working in different programming languages.  Still, the programmer needs good tools to browse and modify data because he doesn't want to write code for everything.  Successful NoSQL databases will have administration tools.  The &lt;a href="http://www.jcr-explorer.org/"&gt;JCR has the JCR Explorer&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/cmis-explorer/"&gt;CMIS has a cool Adobe Air-based explorer&lt;/a&gt;.  Both of these cases are repository standards that sit above a (relational or non-relational) database but they were critical for adoption.  &lt;a href="http://couchdb.apache.org/screenshots.html"&gt;CouchDB has an administration client called Futon&lt;/a&gt; but most of the other NoSQL databases just support an API.  You also want to have the data accessible to reporting and business intelligence tools.  I think that a proliferation of administration/inspection/reporting tools will be a good signal that NoSQL is taking off.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another potential advantage is the trend toward distributed applications which breaks the model of having a centralized database service.  Oracle spent so much marketing force building up their database as being the centralized information repository to rule the enterprise.   In this world of distributed services talking through open APIs, that monolithic image looks primitive.  What is more important is minimal latency, fault tolerance, and the ability to scale to very large data sets.  A large centralized (and generalized) resource is at a disadvantage along all three of these dimensions.  When you start talking about lots of independent databases, the homogeneity of data persistence becomes less of a concern.  It's not like you are going to be integrating these services with SQL.  If you did, your integration would be very brittle because these agilely-developed services are in a constant state of evolution.  You just need to have strong, stable APIs to push and pull data in the necessary formats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The geeky programmer in me (that loved working on that CRM project) is rooting for NoSQL databases.  The recovering DBA in me cringes at the thought of battling data corruption with inferior, unfamiliar tools.  In a perfect world, there will be room for both technologies: relational databases for relational data that needs to be centrally managed as an enterprise asset; NoSQL databases for data that doesn't naturally fit into a relational database schema or has volumes that would strain traditional database technology.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Press Association Chooses Nuxeo</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;French Open Source ECM vendor &lt;a href="http://www.nuxeo.com"&gt;Nuxeo&lt;/a&gt; just &lt;a href="http://www.nuxeo.com/en/news/press-association/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that it was chosen by the &lt;a href="http://www.pressassociation.co.uk/"&gt;Press Association&lt;/a&gt; (PA - the national news agency of the UK and Ireland) for use in PA's publication process. Writers and editors in the UK will use Nuxeo for their editorial workflow. The selection came after a successful prototype phase. One of the deciding factors was that the absence of license costs allowed PA to focus investment on customization and integration of the product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those who have not heard of Nuxeo, most of their activity is in France and they generated a bit of a stir when they changed their technology strategy by discontinuing a successful Zope based product (CPS) and building a new Java based platform on the JBoss stack. Readers of this blog may remember &lt;a href="http://contenthere.blogspot.com/2006/09/nuxeo-cps-switching-to-java.html"&gt;my concern&lt;/a&gt; about the disruption of switching platforms and replacing a mature product. Well, it looks like Nuxeo successfully made the transition and also landed a big, non-French client on the new platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content>

    <title>Process: the good and the bad</title>
    <content type='html'>I have a love/hate relationship with process. I love thinking about process to continuously improve the results from the effort we apply. Good process improves efficiency, increases repeatability, reduces frustration, limits errors, and creates a structure for further optimization. &amp;nbsp;The best processes are the ones that are developed and maintained by people mindfully doing the job with the will to do better. One of my favorite parts of working on small teams is to collaboratively design and refine processes that make a more enjoyable and satisfying work experience.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Process also comes from the top down. And when that happens, it is usually accompanied by an attitude that the process is more important than the people following it. The goal seems to be to make a job so routinized that any idiot can do it. Process becomes a substitute for talent and the result is not only dehumanizing it kills creativity and innovation.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I hate that.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
--- talk about rules for good virtuous processes ---&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Practitioners it feel ownership of the process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Practitioners understand the reasoning behind the process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anyone can propose ideas for improvement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The process is always considered a work in progress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Practitioners benefit from the results of the process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

    <title>Re-platforming www.contenthere.net</title>
    <content type='html'>If you have been playing close attention, you might have noticed that &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net"&gt;www.contenthere.net&lt;/a&gt; is now running on &lt;a href="http://wordpress.org"&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt;.  Prior to the migration, the site was hosted on a combination of &lt;a href="http://www.blogger.com"&gt;Blogger&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://smallbusiness.yahoo.com"&gt;Yahoo Store&lt;/a&gt;, and some hand coded HTML (managed in &lt;a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/"&gt;Subversion&lt;/a&gt; of course).  That arrangement was fine but I ran into limitations with the integration between Yahoo Store and the rest of the architecture.  There were no big show stoppers, just little inconveniences that I was getting tired of working around.  Besides, I was itching to tinker - we techies get like that sometimes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Selecting a new platform was fun because I got to be the client in a process in which I am normally the consultant.  I was quite different from a typical Content Here client.  First of all, I had no budget.  Second, the president of the company (i.e. me) wanted the technology to be fun to program in.  Third, I didn't want to choose a platform that I would recommend to my typical clients because I do not want to appear biased.  Incidentally, the last point is a main reason why I have held off implementation of a content management solution for so long.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My first choice was the &lt;a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/"&gt;Django&lt;/a&gt; web application framework.  I had done some prototyping on the platform and was really impressed with the cleanness of the architecture and how quickly you could build applications.  It is a little like &lt;a href="http://rubyonrails.org/"&gt;Ruby on Rails&lt;/a&gt; but in Python.  Furthermore, Django has a popular e-commerce application called &lt;a href="http://www.satchmoproject.com/"&gt;Satchmo&lt;/a&gt;.  I installed Satchmo and was able to understand the code and make some quick customizations on it.  What really killed Django for me was the lack of a good blogging platform.  &lt;a href="http://blog.michaeltrier.com/2007/12/30/django-blogging-apps"&gt;There are a number of simple django blogging applications out there&lt;/a&gt; but nothing seemed to fit the bill.  The closest was &lt;a href="http://getbanjo.com/"&gt;Banjo&lt;/a&gt; but it didn't seem to be that well supported.   There is actually a &lt;a href="http://www.b-list.org/weblog/2007/nov/29/django-blog/"&gt;long standing discussion in the Django community about the framework's lack of mature blogging applications&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The next two finalists were &lt;a href="drupal.org/"&gt;Drupal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://wordpress.org"&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt;.  I have built sites on Drupal and like the framework a lot.  However, the commerce module always seems to be far behind the current release of the core.  I also think that Drupal is a little bit more than I need for my simple site (a blog with a shopping cart).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My decision to go with WordPress started as a simple prototype.  I was amazed at how quickly I could create a theme to match my old design.  The commerce module &lt;a href="http://www.instinct.co.nz/"&gt;WP e-Commerce&lt;/a&gt; looked pretty solid and I was able to quickly get it working with PayPal as my payment gateway.  I also found some useful plugins to provide me the features I was missing in Blogger (like related posts, etc.).  The thing that sealed the deal for me was the ease with which WordPress imported all my blogger posts and comments.  I was even able to make the permalinks match the same structure as Blogger's for easier URL re-mapping (just a simple rewrite rule).  Wordpress surely has its warts (there are plenty of places where the code gets pretty sketchy) but for a simple, reliable blogging platform with e-commerce capabilities, I am quite pleased.</content>

    <title>Alfresco releases Enterprise Edition 2.2</title>
    <content type='html'>They are a bit behind schedule and there was very little publicity about it but &lt;a href="http://www.alfresco.com"&gt;Alfresco Software&lt;/a&gt; has released version 2.2 of Alfresco Enterprise Edition.  While this is just a point release, 2.2 introduces a couple of big improvements over 2.2.  Probably the most welcome enhancement from a user perspective is the introduction of search within web projects.  While web projects were always indexed for search and the API supported it, users can now search for web content from within the user interface. Developers will appreciate that the deployment mechanism that came with 2.1 now has a GUI that allows developers to define deployments to push code or content to different environments.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it still suffers from some core usability issues, with version 2.2, Alfresco has reached a point where it is a useful tool for web content management.  Many systems integrators work around Alfresco's usability limitations by using Web Scripts to rapidly develop custom user interfaces.    Expect bigger UI improvements in Enterprise 3.0.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information on Alfresco 2.2, you can buy the &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/products-page/reports/open-source-content-management-in-alfresco"&gt;19 page Alfresco evaluation&lt;/a&gt; from Open Source Web Content Management in Java or &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/products-page/reports/open-source-content-management-in-java"&gt;buy the whole 160 page report&lt;/a&gt; to see how Alfresco stacks up against other options.</content>

    <title>Grading your CMS Implementation at J. Boye</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;After taking a break from conferences in 2010, I am planning on doing more speaking in 2011.  I am starting off my 2011 conference campaign with one of my favorite conferences: &lt;a href="http://www.jboye.com/conferences/philadelphia11/"&gt;J. Boye in Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt;.  As I have mentioned &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2009/03/j-boye-philadelphia-2009.html"&gt;before&lt;/a&gt;, the J. Boye conferences are excellent.  The sessions are informative and practitioner-oriented, but what really makes the conferences great is the social element.  More than any other conference that I know of, the J. Boye team plans and promotes social activities that encourage attendees to get to know each other and exchange ideas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I will be presenting a session called &lt;a href="http://www.jboye.com/conferences/philadelphia11/program/speakers/seth-gottlieb/#presentation1"&gt;Grading your CMS implementation&lt;/a&gt;.  There is greater potential to understand requirements in the months after a CMS rollout than leading up to and during the implementation.  The only form of failure is not using that information to make corrections.  However, most organizations label the selection/implementation project as either a qualified success or a total failure and suffer until the next CMS procurement (when they will repeat the cycle). They don't treat it as a milestone in a larger content initiative, which they should.  My presentation will show how to create feedback loop to correct issues in three areas: &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2009/08/dimensions-of-success-or-ways-to-fail.html"&gt;expectation rationality, platform suitability, and project execution&lt;/a&gt;.  Organizations preparing for a CMS initiative will learn how to set their project up for success and avoid common pitfalls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, I will see you at J. Boye in Philadelphia this May (3rd-5th).  If you don't catch my session, I am sure I will see you at one of the social events.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

So, if you like your information free (as in "libre", not "free weekend at a timeshare promotion") you might consider checking these alternative sites.]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I just published an &lt;a href="http://www.optaros.com/wp/wp_5_cms_report.shtml"&gt;epic whitepaper&lt;/a&gt; where I discuss how selecting an open source CMS is different than a proprietary software selection and summarize 15 open source projects:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;Alfresco&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;Bricolage&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;Drupal&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;eZ publish&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;Lenya&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;Mambo/Joomla&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;MediaWiki&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;Midgard&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;OpenCMS&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;phpBB&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;Plone&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;Roller&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;Twiki&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;TYPO3&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;Zope CMF&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The summaries are not to the depth that you would find in the &lt;a href="http://www.cmswatch.com/CMS/Report/"&gt;CMS Report&lt;/a&gt; (which reviews Midgard, OpenCMS, Plone, and Zope) but they give a high level view of what the project is about.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here is the abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The open source community has produced a number of useful, high quality content management systems which presents an opportunity to deliver tailored content management solutions without the high licensing or management fees associated with commercially-licensed or hosted software. However, the sheer number of open source CMS projects and the ineffectualness of traditional commercial software selection techniques can make the task of finding the right open source software an intimidating challenge. The strategy of using feature matrices is particularly ill-suited to open source software selection. A more practical approach is to match your needs to a common business problem that others have solved using open source software and engage with the community to learn about their experiences in implementing the solution. Doing so will take advantage of the unique aspects of open source software: the openness of the user community and the transparency of the development process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The content management use cases that are particularly well served by open source are: informational websites, online periodicals, collaborative workspaces, and online communities. This paper briefly describes some open source projects that have been successfully applied to support these use cases and gives techniques for how to engage with the community. While open source is frequently and successfully used as an alternative to custom development of unique solutions, the use of open source software will be the topic of another white paper or case study.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Feedback is welcome in the comments.

    <title>How Many Microblogging Services Does the World Really Need?</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;After hearing all this news about &lt;a href="http://status.net/"&gt;status.net&lt;/a&gt;, I took a few moments to connect my &lt;a href="http://identi.ca/sggottlieb"&gt;Identi.ca account&lt;/a&gt; with my &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/sggottlieb"&gt;Twitter account&lt;/a&gt;.  I am not at all sure what good that did but I figured it couldn't hurt.  While I was there, I got to thinking &lt;em&gt;what is so special about a microblog?&lt;/em&gt;  And I came to the conclusion &amp;mdash; nothing.  You can think of a microblog as a title-only blog (entries with no bodies). What is new there? Subscriptions have already been handled quite well by RSS.  What makes Twitter (and Facebook) so important is not the ability to post 140 character messages.  It's not even really the API or mobile integration.  What makes Twitter/Facebook important is that they are used by so many of the people that you want to reach.  There are plenty of failed status-oriented services that have had the technology but, either through bad timing or other missteps, failed to build an audience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wonder how attempts at internal microblogs are working out.  I haven't heard any success stories and I doubt if any survive past the initial novelty phase. If there are urges to microblog within the enterprise, employees could satisfy them with the internal blogging infrastructure that has been idle in most organizations.  If there is any internal application for the microblog it is aggregating what employees are tweeting out on Twitter.  But, depending on the staff, I don't know how interesting that would be either.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think that the microblog is going to fail as a category of software.  There just isn't a big enough market of buyers that can build a sustainable microblogging community.  I can't think of existing sites with large audiences investing to buy or build a microblogging capability.  If you were &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;, would you rather have a reader tweet a story link on Twitter (where it could be re-tweeted by millions of users) or on your CNN own microblog community?  The only purpose I see for status.net is just in case Twitter kills itself (by running out of money or ruining the service).  I seem to remember a lot of people threatening to defect to Identi.ca and FriendFeed when Twitter was going through its problems.  But that didn't happen.  How long can the status.net's and Identi.ca's of the world sustain the energy and motivation to be an understudy behind a healthy actor?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know the argument that suggests that distributed communication services will eventually win like how the open, distributed web was destined to eventually beat out then popular online services like AOL, Compuserve, and Prodigy. But I don't think this is the same.  If I am missing the point here, please enlighten me.  I would love to see competition in this sector if it makes sense.  I just don't see it.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type='html'>Depending on how your failover system gets synchronized with the primary system, you should also consider pulling the same page from the production server and running a diff to compare them. If the synchronization were to fail and your front page still loaded but it had content from 3 months ago it would pass your test but might still be wrong. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is especially important when using a hot standby server for a news site with frequent updates. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We use the same strategy but with different tools, which I outlined in my post here: http://www.thinkcreative.com/TC-Blog/Why-we-upgraded-from-Amazon-Web-Services</content>

    <title>ZORacle Part III: Connecting Zope to an Oracle database</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Database Adaptors and SQL Methods&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have ever evaluated &lt;a href="http://zope.org"&gt;Zope&lt;/a&gt; you have probably heard that, in addition to using the included object database (the ZODB), Zope can access most SQL compliant relational databases.  The typical framework to do this is Data Adaptors and ZSQLMethods.  Data Adaptors, commonly called DAs, are plug in products that give you a connection to a particular database.  For example, there is a popular DA for &lt;a href="http://www.mysql.com/"&gt;MySQL&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href="http://www.zope.org/Members/adustman/Products/ZMySQLDA"&gt;ZMySQLDA&lt;/a&gt;.  Once you have a DA, you can use the Zope Management Interface (ZMI) to create a ZSQL Connection to connect to the database and ZSQL Methods to execute queries against that database.  The whole process is pretty well documented &lt;a href="http://www.zope.org/Documentation/Books/ZopeBook/2_6Edition/RelationalDatabases.stx"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  What you get when you go this route is a published Zope object that gives you a result set of data based on a query, or a handle on a query that can update the database (using SQL update, delete, or insert commands).  ZSQL Methods are the most useful if you want to create a page in Zope (written in either &lt;a href="http://www.zope.org/Documentation/Books/ZopeBook/2_6Edition/ZPT.stx"&gt;ZPT&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.zope.org/Members/Pam/DTMLScripting"&gt;DTML&lt;/a&gt;) and you want to display information stored in a relational database.  Unfortunately, there are not a lot of DA options for Oracle.  The main open source one is &lt;a href="http://www.zope.org/Members/matt/dco2"&gt;DCOracle2&lt;/a&gt; which is no longer active although there are still many people using it.  My experience with compiling DCOracle2 for Oracle 10g looked like &lt;a href="http://mail.zope.org/pipermail/zope-db/2005-September/004306.html"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;.  Even after that, it was still flaky.  The best instructions I found are &lt;a href="http://www.zope.org/Members/jetfu/HowToInstallDcOracle2/howto_view"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; but before you start with DCOracle2, look at the &lt;a href="http://sqlrelay.sourceforge.net/sqlrelay/programming/zope.html"&gt;SQL Relay's DA&lt;/a&gt;.  If you have money to spend, you can also look at &lt;a href="http://www.egenix.com/files/python/eGenix-mx-Extensions.html#mxODBC"&gt;eGenix mxODBC&lt;/a&gt; which talks to Oracle over ODBC and is not too bad at $120 per server....  Unless, however you are running on *NIX.  In that case you need to buy an Oracle ODBC driver which may cost &lt;a href="http://www.easysoft.com/products/data_access/odbc_oracle_driver/index.htm"&gt;$1,599.00 per server&lt;/a&gt; (Windows Oracle ODBC drivers are free).  The mxODBC DA is the most configurable DA that I have seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, if you want to do more heavy lifting with a relational database, this framework is a little weak because you probably don't want to do manage all your SQL logic in the ZMI, especially if you want to access the data from Python based classes sitting on a file system (deployment gets difficult here).  So the next level in working with relational data is to use a DA and a regular SQL method in your python code.  That might look a little like this (note: all code samples are meant to be illustrative, I have left out important bits that are required for the code to run):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;br /&gt;def __init__(self,context, map): &lt;br /&gt; self._context = context&lt;br /&gt; #..... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;def selectProperties(self, pid):&lt;br /&gt;        setattr(self, '_selectProperties', &lt;br /&gt;            SQL('_selectProperties', '', CONNECTION_NAME, 'propertyId', &lt;br /&gt;            'SELECT %s FROM %s WHERE SCHEMA_ID = &lt;dtml-sqlvar propertyId type="int"&gt;' % &lt;br /&gt;     self._fieldList(map),RDBDAO.TABLE_NAME[self._context.id])) )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; method = self._selectProperties.__of__(self._context)&lt;br /&gt;        return method(propertyId=pid)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;def setLocals(self):&lt;br /&gt;        try:&lt;br /&gt;            results = self.selectProperties(self._context.propertyId)&lt;br /&gt;            columns = results.names()&lt;br /&gt;            &lt;br /&gt;            if len(results) &lt; 1:&lt;br /&gt;                raise Exception, "Can't find my database row."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;            for record in results:&lt;br /&gt;                for column in columns:&lt;br /&gt;                    if column.lower() in self._propertyTypes:&lt;br /&gt;                        if record[column] is not None:&lt;br /&gt;                            self._rdata[column.lower()] = self._conversion.toZope(record[column],self._propertyTypes[column.lower()])&lt;br /&gt;                        else:&lt;br /&gt;                            zLOG.LOG('RDBDAO', DEBUG, "no value for ", column.lower())&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the selectProperties method we create a new method called _selectProperties which is a SQL Method.  Don't get too caught up in the syntax.  The only thing I would call out is the use of "&amp;lt;dtml-sqlvar&amp;gt;" which does things like apply proper quoting and escape bad characters when the type is string.  the CONNECTION_NAME variable is actually just a string which matches the name of the ZSQL Connection that you set up to point to the database that you want to talk to.  If you put the ZQL Connection right at the root folder, your object will have a reference to it through &lt;a href="http://www.zope.org/Documentation/Books/ZopeBook/2_6Edition/Acquisition.stx"&gt;Acquisition&lt;/a&gt;.  However, this doesn't happen if the object does not exist within the acquisition hierarchy or is so brand new that the acquisition context has not yet been set.  So we wrap the _selectProperties method in another method called selectProperties which just calls the private _selectProperties method using the context of the calling class which was passed in the __init__ method - hence the syntax  __of__(self._context).  Then the setLocals method runs the query and puts the results in a local dictionary.  the _conversion object contains methods to do data conversion like handling dates.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notice how there is no syntax for opening and closing a connection.  That is all handled in the background by the ZSQL Connection.  This example does not do a database update.  If it did, you might see a SQL method that issued a query of "commit."  Depending on the implementation of the DA, connection pooling and other configuration tends to be extremely simple.  There are very few parameters to adjust and that gives you little control over how your application manages connections.  Still, this method of data access goes pretty far - as long as the DA behaves reliably.  When this framework starts to fall down is when you start working with really long strings such as CLOBs (Character Large Object).  The problem arises because SQL methods only accept simple SQL statements.  The update code would look like this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;br /&gt;def updateProperties(self, propertyId, args):&lt;br /&gt;        &lt;br /&gt;        setattr(self, '_updateProperties', &lt;br /&gt;            SQL('_updateProperties', '', CONNECTION_NAME, 'propertyId ' + ' '.join([k for k in args] ), &lt;br /&gt;            self.sqlUpdateString(args)) )&lt;br /&gt;        &lt;br /&gt;        method = self._updateProperties.__of__(self._context)&lt;br /&gt;        return method(schemaId=propertyId, **args)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;def sqlUpdateString(self, map):&lt;br /&gt;        """This method creates an update statement based on the property map.  &lt;br /&gt;        There may be more properties than we will be setting when  we execute this statement &lt;br /&gt;        but that is taken care of by the optional argument on the dtml-sqlvar tag.&lt;br /&gt;        """&lt;br /&gt;        sqlString = "UPDATE " + RDBDAO.TABLE_NAME[self._context.id] &lt;br /&gt;        sqlString += " SET " +  ", ".join(["%s = %s" % (k.upper(), self._conversion.setValue(k,DBTYPE,self._propertyTypes[k])) for k in map])&lt;br /&gt;        sqlString += ", MODIFIED_DATE_TIME=%s" % (DBTYPE=='MySQL' and 'CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()' or 'SYSTIMESTAMP',)&lt;br /&gt;        sqlString += ", MODIFY_INSTANCE='%s:%s'" % (os.getenv('HOSTNAME'), INSTANCE_HOME)&lt;br /&gt;        sqlString += " WHERE PROPERTY_ID = &lt;dtml-sqlvar schemaId type=\"int\"&gt;"&lt;br /&gt;        return sqlString&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here the _conversion class puts in the appropriate &amp;lt;dtml-sqlvar&amp;gt; syntax as well as&lt;br/&gt;do some additional data conversions.  In Oracle, a SQL statement can only be up to a certain number of characters - I can't remember how many, but if you try to issue a query like "UPDATE tableA SET field A = '[some multiple thousand character string such as the body of an article]'", you will get an error.  MySQL tends to be a little more forgiving but there are limits.  In order to set large string values, you need to use "bound variables" so that the update query gets assembled on the database side.  DA's and SQL Methods don't do this very well (actually they don't do it at all).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://sqlrelay.sourceforge.net/"&gt;SQL Relay&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get around this limitation, we used &lt;a href="http://sqlrelay.sourceforge.net/"&gt;SQL Relay&lt;/a&gt; which allowed our Python DAO to talk directly to the database without going through the Zope DA pathway.  Although SQL Relay also has a DA, we didn't use it because it does not support bound variables.  But the Python client libraries, which we used in our code, do support binding.  SQL Relay consists of several components:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A set of connection daemons which hold the connection to the database open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A listener which is a deamon that runs and listens on a specified port and forward requests to a connection&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A client that can talk to the listener&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A cache manager daemon that maintains the query cache and removes stale result sets&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.jngcommunications.com/seth/SQLRLogicalArchitecture.jpg"/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can put the listener on the server with the database or the server with the application server.  Our design had everything but the clients sitting on the relational database server.  The system is also extremely configurable through &lt;a href="http://sqlrelay.sourceforge.net/sqlrelay/configuring.html"&gt;editing various XML files&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So now, with SQL Relay, our update code looks a little like this:  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;br /&gt;        def __init__(self,context,map,connection):&lt;br /&gt;         """The connection object is passed in from DBTransactionManager.

Also, we have a configurable database connection framework that can be used to interface wiht several different databases.  If I have an opportunity to work on another Zope project that needed relational database connectivity, SQL Relay (either using the DA or the client libraries) will be the first option that I try.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>A Content Management Definition</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I just heard &lt;a href="http://www.gilbane.com/"&gt;Frank Gilbane&lt;/a&gt; define Content Management as the "management of &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;unstructured information&lt;/span&gt;" at the Gilbane Content Management conference this morning. The definition is growing on me and here is why... I think there needs to be some limits on what we include when we say "content." For example, I would not call transactions in a General Ledger system "content." I think that the most structured we get with content is &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;semi-structured&lt;/span&gt; where certain information (such as publish date, author name, and maybe even title) is structured and can be fielded or tagged. However, the body of the content (as in the beautiful prose I am writing here) is most certainly unstructured.  Is the degree of structure how I decide what to call content and what to call data?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Preliminary Results from the One-Field Job Application Experiment</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago I experimented with an &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2012/08/an-unconventional-approach-to-recruiting.html"&gt;unconventional approach to recruiting a technical web project manager&lt;/a&gt;.  A lot of people were intrigued by the idea and I promised to write about my findings.  The experiment is still going on but I am happy to report the intermediate results.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a pure recruiting tool, results were mixed. Out of around 300 people who visited the form, I got around 40 successful submissions.  Of those, there were 3 serious and qualified candidates.  The rest were a mixture of developers (who didn't have enough project management experience), people who just wanted to solve the puzzle, and some people who were overqualified for the role. Sifting through the non-serious candidates was pretty easy.  Many of these URLs were generic sites like Google or they had query strings letting me know that they were just curious about the puzzle.  Personal websites and LinkedIn profiles were easy to spot and I enjoyed browsing those.  I don't know how this stacks up against traditional recruiting methods but it was certainly less work on my end. I didn't have to read through boring résumés.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I didn't promote the form a whole lot.  I posted about it here on my blog and I shared the post on Twitter, Google Plus, and LinkedIn.  I might have gotten a larger sample size if I actively drove traffic to the form like, for example, if I posted a brief job description plus a link to the form on a job site.  Some SEO work and Ad Words may have helped too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a screening tool, the form was excellent.  Much better than expected. I asked all of the candidates that came through our traditional process to submit the form before talking to me.  A lot of people totally didn't get it and I saved myself loads of time not having to read their résumés or interview them.  The ones that did make it through thought it was pretty cool and I think it increased their interest in the role.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biggest surprise was the professional networking element. I made several great connections with some of the non-serious candidates. In addition to meeting kindred spirits, I got to discuss interesting topics like roles and methodologies in web development and what it takes to manage an effective website. It was professionally refreshing to meet these people. I even met a Lionbridge co-worker from Poland and learned about some of the cool work that they are doing.  He is a smart guy. I am glad I know him now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In all, I think the experiment was a huge success.  It didn't magically turn up the ideal candidate on its own but that expectation was probably unrealistic. Going in, I knew that this approach would only evaluate a couple dimensions (technical skills and web affinity) of a very complex and dynamic role. The "One Field Job App" didn't look at communication or organizational skills at all. But before launching this tool, technical screening was very time-intensive. In addition to saving time, I am particularly happy with the unexpected benefits of meeting new professionals and talking with old colleagues about this challenging problem.  I will definitely use this approach to recruiting again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh, and one more thing… &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2012/08/web-techies-use-chrome-and-firefox.html"&gt;I have still not received a successful submission from anyone using Internet Explorer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Supporting Internet Explorer 6</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sggottlieb/4420066985/" title="IE6 not supported on Microsoft.com by sggottlieb, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="IE6 not supported on Microsoft.com" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4053/4420066985_c6f108df82.jpg" height="408" width="500" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Over the past few days, I have been involved in a number of conversations about supporting Internet Explorer 6.  Arguing about when to drop support for outdated browsers is a sport that is as old as the web itself.  There is nothing really new here but the IE6 support debate feels particularly emotional — not as charged as back when people were arguing for only supporting Internet Explorer, but close.&lt;br /&gt;
IE6 had a really long run.  &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_web_browsers"&gt;It was Microsoft's browser offering for 5 years (late 2001 through late 2006)&lt;/a&gt;.  Up to that point, Microsoft was releasing a major version of IE every year.  Now it looks like they are settling into a pace of every other year. That means that IE 6 was installed on a lot of computers.  In particular, a lot of computers that were bought when internet usage was starting to get really ubiquitous.  In many businesses and households, these computers were bought as an internet appliance with a really long expected lifespan — like a refrigerator or a telephone.  Companies are hanging onto their old IE6 computers.  Vista's flop means that Windows XP is still the corporate standard and IE6 comes with XP.  Unless you have a technical or information-intensive job or are working at a new company, chances are you are on a highly locked down, old Windows XP computer that your employer begrudgingly bought to give you access to email and the intranet.  Your employer doesn't want to upgrade your machine unless absolutely necessary.  That usage pattern has caused IE6 to linger longer than other browsers.  See how IE8 seems to eat up more of IE7's market share than IE6's?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sggottlieb/4520850462/" title="Internet Explorer Browser Share by sggottlieb, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Internet Explorer Browser Share" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2691/4520850462_539af4d708.jpg" height="242" width="500" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Not only do the numbers of IE6 user continue to be significant, the types of users seem to be desirable as well: internet n00bs that click on ads and buy what they see (with the money that was not taken by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance-fee_fraud"&gt;Nigerian 419 scams&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;
Technical people have little empathy for these types of users.  The first thing we do when we boot up a relative's computer for home tech support is stop the malware/adware processes, install Firefox, and hide the IE icon.   As developers, we know that a requirement for IE6 support translates into maintaining two code bases: one that uses all the goodness of the latest HTML and CSS standards and fast Javascript engines; and another that is a bundle of hacks to compensate for IE6's quirks.  Many web development firms I know are starting to charge an additional 20% - 30% to include IE6 support.  They are not price gauging. This is probably less than the actual cost.  The customer will probably invest an even larger percentage of additional resources to maintain the application.&lt;br /&gt;
For this reason, an increasingly larger number of websites are discontinuing support for IE6.  They have done the calculations and have decided that the convenience for the IE6 hold-outs is not worth additional cost and drag on innovation.  I don't mean  to sound like a jerk, but big web properties (like &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/"&gt;Content Here&lt;/a&gt;) dropping IE6 is a good thing for everyone (almost):&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visitors will have a greater incentive to upgrade.  If they can't upgrade on their own, they can make the case to their employers that running a 9 year old browser is not acceptable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The more modern technology will increase overall security&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Web sites and applications can be developed more cheaply and with higher quality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The spending to upgrade outdated equipment will be good for the economy.  Companies and households don't have to buy $2,000 laptops, they can probably get away with cheap NetBooks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This site never supported IE6.  If you are stuck on that browser, I am sorry for the inconvenience that I have caused.  But, I figure you are used to browsing broken websites by now :)</content>

    <title>Google Language Tags</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;If you were not able implement a &lt;a href="http://blog.lionbridge.com/marketing/2012/01/31/url-management-for-a-global-business/"&gt;host-based strategy for your Global Business URLs&lt;/a&gt;, you might be able to implement &lt;a href="http://support.google.com/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=189077&amp;topic=2370587&amp;ctx=topic"&gt;Google's rel-alternate-hreflang tag&lt;/a&gt;.  This article, &lt;a href="http://www.dot-connection.com/2012/03/giving-google-better-instructions-about-language-and-country/"&gt;Giving Google better instructions about language and country&lt;/a&gt;, provides a good explanation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The basic gist is that if you are hosting multiple localized sites on the same host and using paths to keep them separate, Google is going to think that your UK site is just a duplicate of your US and just index those pages once.  This will send UK traffic to your US site and undermine the value of your localization.  Putting this link tag in the HTML head&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &amp;lt;link rel="alternate" hreflang="en-GB" href="http://www.example.com/en-GB/about" /&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;will tell Google that there is a UK version of your US about page under /en-GB/about.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reading through the Google documentation, it is probably a good idea to use this tag even if you have your different localized sites under different hosts.  It can't certainly hurt.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>J. Boye: Wiki in the Enterprise</title>
    <content type='html'>Because of the inherent simplicity of the technology, wiki projects are less likely to fail in implementation than WCM or ECM projects.  However, many companies still struggle to get the desired value out of their wiki initiatives.  Purely managed and abandoned wikis have become yet another set of silos for information to hide in.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Janus Boye and Dorthe Jespersen's new report &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://eng.jboye.dk/research/wiki_in_the_enterprise"&gt;Wiki in the Enterprise&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;  contains a very well conceived and written analysis of what it takes to successfully implement a corporate wikis.  Their research is based on interviews with enterprise wiki adopters and personal experience.  It covers: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;the positioning of wiki's in the content technology marketplace and the benefits that they promise&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;real world experience the impact and challenges of adopting wikis&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;recommendations for executing a wiki initiative&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their advice covers the cultural and organizational aspects of information management that are so often overlooked in technology-oriented projects.  If you are considering using a wiki to support collaboration or information management in your company, and rightly understand that success is not a matter of technology, you should definitely read this report. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content>

    <title>How much of an application do you put in source control?</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Warning: geeky coding post&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of my responsibilities at &lt;a href="http://www.globalmarketingops.com"&gt;Lionbridge&lt;/a&gt; is running infrastructure for our many marketing sites and applications.  Like all good technical organizations, our development and deployment processes revolve around a source code management (SCM) system (in our case Git).  Because we are running on a CMS (Wordpress - hold the religious war on whether Wordpress is a CMS), our websites are a combination of platform (Wordpress), customization (plugins and themes), configuration, and content.  The question is: how much of this do you put into your SCM?  Let's start with the obvious.  You don't put content in your SCM.  With configuration, it depends.  Some frameworks allow you to tier your configuration options between global and environment-specific.  For example, &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2012/04/keeping-django-settings-generic.html"&gt;this is how I handle Django settings.&lt;/a&gt;  I haven't come up with a clever way to do this in Wordpress so, for now, I am keeping wp-config.php out of the SCM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for platform and customizations, my tendency has always been to &lt;em&gt;keep the platform out of the SCM&lt;/em&gt;. In this model, your build process is to install the platform than then deploy the themes and plugins from source control. I have done many projects in this way and it worked quite well. But another developer set up our Wordpress infrastructure for these sites and his preference was to put the whole Wordpress install into SCM and do a "git pull" to update the whole site. I also didn't love the idea of using Git to deploy.  I like to pull the code to some alternative machine (my workstation or a server), (compile/)package it, and then &lt;em&gt;push&lt;/em&gt; it to the web farm.  &lt;a href="http://docs.fabfile.org/en/1.5/"&gt;Fabric&lt;/a&gt; is an excellent tool for this.  You can still use Fabric in this scenario to execute Git commands on the remote servers but it still doesn't feel right to me.  I prefer that runtime servers have as little software running on them as possible.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first I hated this set up.  I missed a developer being able to install our themes and plugins into any old Wordpress instance.  I had doubts about the complexity of administration settings and the potential of editing source-controlled files trough the web.  But I kept an open mind and I have come around.  Here are the reasons:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The upgrade process is a lot tighter&lt;/strong&gt;.  Now I just upgrade Wordpress on a development instance, test, and then deploy the upgrade through the normal code deployment process.  Plugins are handled the same way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Customization compatibility issues just go away&lt;/strong&gt;. When we have an outside contractor work around the system by working in his/her own Wordpress we run into issues where the new code is incompatible with versions of Wordpress and our installed plugins.  This simply doesn't happen when you check out the whole platform.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your SCM provides diff'ing functionality.&lt;/strong&gt;  Suspect that one of your environments does not conform to the rest?  Worried that you have been hacked?  Simply do a "git status" and see what files are different from the repository. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;One thing to keep in mind: in this model you don't do any upgrades or plugin installation through the web.  You also need to turn off the ability to edit theme and plugin code through the web.  We needed to do this anyway because we have a clustered infrastructure and those changes need to be propagated across every web server in the farm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It took me a really long time to come around to liking this setup.  I think a big part of that is my Java background. Java makes a big deal about packaging and deployment.  Pulling directly from Git seems more common in the PHP world, which never had a build process.  But now, I am pretty happy with this setup.  The best part is ensuring against compatibility issues (#2 on my list above). I still prefer deploying code &lt;em&gt;to&lt;/em&gt; servers rather than pulling code &lt;em&gt;from&lt;/em&gt; them but my conviction is steadily eroding.  It's kind of nice not needing scripts to move around files and avoid overwriting files that are managed independently on each environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just out of curiosity, I would love to know what source code management and deployment processes other PHP developer use.  Let me know.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Graffito CMS</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I recently started tracking the &lt;a href="http://incubator.apache.org/graffito/"&gt;Graffito project&lt;/a&gt;.  Graffito is a very early stage open source Java-based CMS project being incubated by the &lt;a href="http://www.apache.org"&gt;Apache Software Foundation&lt;/a&gt;.  What interests me the most about Graffito is that it seems to be the answer to a need that I have been hearing a lot recently:  a Java-based CMS that integrates into an existing presentation tier.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Graffito is a set of components that can work with different repositories and integrate with other various Java based presentation layers.  Graffito provides functionality that people need out of a CMS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A repository abstraction layer which gives a common API to access content (documents, folders, etc.) from a relational database (through OJB), WebDav (such as Slide), or a JCR based repository.  Currently, the OJB connector is the only one that has been implemented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Concurrency management so that multiple users do not interfere with each others work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Security&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Content integration which can integrate content from multiple repositories into one tree&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Workflow&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Graffito is closely tied to and integrates with &lt;a href="http://portals.apache.org/jetspeed-2/"&gt;Jetspeed 2&lt;/a&gt;, which is one of the Apache portal projects.  I have a feeling that Jetspeed 2 may give Graffito some momentum as Jetspeed 2 users look for a CMS to put content on their portals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently the Graffito project &lt;a href="http://incubator.apache.org/graffito/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; has been showing lots of change.  Broken links are being fixed and a lot of new information is being added.  This should be a good project to watch if not participate in.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Social Bookmarking on Your Intranet</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I have been thinking a lot recently about intranets as being an area of huge opportunity for companies.  Put another way, most corporate intranets are broken.  At the &lt;a href="http://www.enterprisesearchsummit.com/"&gt;Enterprise Search Summit&lt;/a&gt;, several speakers made the point that intranets suffer from neglect - especially compared to external websites which are actively managed by people who know their audience and have a huge incentive to improve the utility and user experience of the website.  I strongly agree.  When I look at an employee portal and see weather and company stock ticker portlets, I can't help but think that someone bought and installed a portal product and didn't know what to do with it.  I have been there.  I remember putting in these free portlets as placeholders and then returning years later only to find that they are still there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So if companies can't bring themselves to invest in an intranet in a formal way, is it possible that a company could build a community that will contribute on a more grassroots level?  &lt;a href="http://intranetblog.blogware.com/blog/_archives/2006/2/27/1785186.html"&gt;This post&lt;/a&gt; from Toby Ward's &lt;a href="http://intranetblog.blogware.com"&gt;Intranet Blog&lt;/a&gt; talks about introducing social bookmarking functionality behind the corporate firewall.  &lt;a href="http://www.rawsugar.com/www2006/28.pdf"&gt;MITRE is doing a social bookmarking experiment&lt;/a&gt; by adapting the open source software &lt;a href="http://scuttle.org/"&gt;Scuttle&lt;/a&gt;.  No verdict on succeess yet.  IBM has done a similar experiment called &lt;a href="http://acmqueue.com/modules.php?name=Content&amp;pa=showpage&amp;pid=344&amp;page=1"&gt;DogEar&lt;/a&gt; and they had some promising initial results.  However, it may be too early to tell.  In the case of Wikis, another social content tool, I have heard people say things like "it is new so people are still contributing to it."  The true test is whether the enthusiasm can be sustained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The skeptic in me says most companies will not be successful in implementing most grassroots, social technologies within the firewall.  One thing that happened when the Internet bubble burst, was that people became very discriminating where they invest their passion and energy.  Many people poured their sweat and soul into companies that turned around and laid them off or lost the feeling that the company was an extension of themselves.  Business is business.  I feel like that is a factor in the growth of open source.  Open source is a safe place to dedicate yourself because you can take it with you no matter where you go.  There are still companies that create the startup atmosphere but those are more the exception than the rule.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get people to participate in this way, it needs to be recognized as part of the job or give some immediate personal benefit.  People need to want to do it for selfish reasons.  So if it is personally more effective to bookmark an intranet page using the bookmarking software than a browser, social bookmarking may have a chance.  Of course, that assumes that there is content on the intranet worth bookmarking.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Michael Sampson&amp;#39;s A-Z of Virtual Teams</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://www.michaelsampson.net"&gt;Michael Sampson&lt;/a&gt; has been running a series of practical tips for virtual teams: &lt;a href="http://www.michaelsampson.net/2008/03/a-z-of-virtua-1.html"&gt;A-Z of Virtual Teams&lt;/a&gt;.  While Northampton, Massachusetts is not as remote to my client base as New Zealand, none of my clients are local so these tips are certainly useful to me.  Many of the tips are common sense but what makes them really worth reading is that at the end of each one there is a section called "What do I need to do?"  This is where Michael spells out actionable strategies for applying the principle.</content>

    <title>Content Marketing Strategy Checklist</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I really enjoyed reading &lt;a href="http://www.velocitypartners.co.uk/b2b-content-marketing-strategy-checklist/"&gt;Velocity's Big Fat B2B Content Marketing Strategy Checklist&lt;/a&gt;.  In addition to it's irreverent tone and design, the checklist is great because it forces the reader to think through all that goes into a successful marketing program.  Of special interest to marketing operations folks is the "Flog It" section which talks about getting the most leverage out of content: promotion, lead nurturing, atomization (creating sub pieces derived off of the main piece), and measurement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people outside of marketing operations discount the effort that goes in after the content is finalized and ready for publishing. It really is just the beginning.  The best results are achieved by nailing the publishing and post-publishing activities.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>My Microsoft Office CMS Analogy</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;The other day I was trying to describe to a client how content management systems are different.  My audience was not familiar with some of the core features of a CMS so my examples were too abstract to get my points across.  However, they were familiar with Microsoft Office so I used that as an analogy.  They found it quite useful so I thought I would repeat it here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The Microsoft Office Analogy of Web Content Management Systems&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine your boss wants you to "put down a few thoughts" on a topic to share electronically with a group.  You might choose to create a Word document, a PowerPoint presentation, an Excel work book, or maybe even an Outlook email message and then start typing out a list.  Because you just want to capture some ideas and your boss was so vague about the format, it doesn't really matter what you choose.  Your boss asked for ideas, not a deliverable.  Let's say you choose PowerPoint because you have a nice looking master template and you figure a few bullet points would look nice in big text on one slide.  It doesn't hurt that you are really comfortable with using PowerPoint.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So you show your boss the PowerPoint deck and he wants you to elaborate more.  You have used terms that need to be defined and he wants you to support your points with some background information.  This "few thoughts" is starting to sound like a memo or a report. Now PowerPoint is not looking so good.  What do you do?  You can start to overload PowerPoint's features to make it work like a word processor; or bail out and copy/paste everything into Microsoft Word.  You will probably make this decision based on how familiar you are with PowerPoint vs. Word, how particular your boss is going to be about the format, and how long this document will live. If you make the wrong decision, fighting the technology will start to dominate the time you spend on this project.  Every change will risk blowing up the whole document.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Strengths and Weaknesses&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like all analogies, this had its strengths and weaknesses:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Analogy Strengths&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Many companies choose a CMS for arbitrary reasons without really understanding their requirements. When requirements are vague (like "we just want a simple website"), all options look equally viable.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stakeholders often have tacit but very specific requirements.  e.g.  "I will know it when I see it."&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you really know a technology, you can force it on a problem by overloading features and redefining the problem.  For example, while the MS Word user sees a bunch of paragraphs, the PowerPoint user sees a series of vertically arranged left-aligned text boxes.  However, eventually these solutions tend to become unstable, especially if they need to get supported by different people.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You need to know when to swap tools.  If you do it too late, you waste too much time misusing the old technology and you have more content to move over.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Analogy Weaknesses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;My client immediately wanted to know which CMSs were like Word and which CMSs were like PowerPoint.  You don't want to go too far with this analogy because a CMS is more than a document editor.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The switching costs from one CMS to another is much much greater that from one document format to another.  If this was a CMS implementation, you want to ask your boss to clarify where this project is going before you pick your tool.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;While not perfect, I think this analogy did its job of making people think about CMS selection in terms that they can relate to.  They can now visualize themselves misusing the wrong tool to get the results they want and living in constant fear that one more hack is going to bring the whole site down.  They are now thinking about their website in terms of a development roadmap that will be influenced by different stakeholders over time.  They can relate to how people have a difficult time expressing requirements that they know tacitly and can apply familiar skills to get clarification.  As long as I can keep them from over identifying the website with a MS Office document, I think I am going to be OK.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Why you should do your homepage wireframe last</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;When building websites, I always recommend developing the home page last because the purpose of the homepage is to highlight content within the site.  You need build out the site so you have something to highlight before you build the homepage.  Over the past year, I have started to realize that the same advice holds true for design.  In fact, I now feel even stronger about that rule for design.  Here are four reasons why.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A homepage wireframe doesn't tell a whole lot.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;Wireframes are helpful to express content structure and site functionality.  When I look at a wireframe, I see a content model (what elements make up a particular type of content) and features (how the visitor interacts with the content &amp;mdash; commenting, voting, sharing, related links, etc.).  The home page is more of a summary.  You don't see that level of detail.  The things that matter to a homepage (branding elements like font, imagery and palette) are not even captured in a wireframe.   Talk about those things near then end of the project because you can make sweeping visual changes by editing a few lines of a style sheet.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The biggest functionality decisions are in the inner pages of the site.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although you may think you have scoped the project during your requirements phase, the devil is in the details.  &lt;em&gt;How&lt;/em&gt; the functionality works will have huge implications on project cost. The sooner you have those conversations, the sooner you will be able to adjust budget and scope so you can spend resources cost-effectively.  Leave those decisions to the end and everyone gets surprised ... in a bad way.  &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Internal audiences care more about the home page than external audiences do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Let's face it, if your site is like most sites, most of your traffic is coming from search engines and link sharing (Twitter, Facebook, etc.).  If you have something worthy of your audience's attention, Google is going to know about it and take your visitors directly there.  The homepage doesn't do much more than give a visitor something to look at when he doesn't know where to go.  The homepage is more about corporate vanity than serving audiences.  &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is easy to get bogged down in political issues that have nothing to do with the functionality of the site.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        While there is very little functional substance on the homepage, that doesn't mean people can't argue about it.  If the homepage is treated as a symbol for what is important to an organization (which it often is), a design session will quickly degrade into a turf battle. Your  designer will try to mediate, but there is no way he will be able to settle such a fundamental argument.  Don't waste time arguing in the beginning of the project when there is so much productive work to be done.  &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I regularly meet resistance from designers who habitually begin with the homepage.  I understand the temptation.  On the surface, a homepage wireframe seems easy and uncontroversial.  It is just a bunch of blocks on the page that stakeholders can privately fill with their imagination; there are no assertions on how major site features behave. But, from a technical design perspective, we don't learn anything from the homepage wireframe.  We can't start thinking about content structure and end-user functionality that will have major implications in scope and planning.  The longer we delay that work, the greater project risk.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Redfin on Bricolage</title>
    <content type='html'>There is a &lt;a href="http://blog.redfin.com/devblog/2008/03/plumbing_upgrade_were_using_bricolage_for_content_management.html"&gt;good post&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href="http://www.redfin.com"&gt;Redfin&lt;/a&gt; blog about why they selected &lt;a href="http://bricolage.cc"&gt;Bricolage&lt;/a&gt; to manage their website including why they broke down and implemented a CMS and why they chose Bricolage over &lt;a href="http://www.alfresco.com"&gt;Alfresco&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://drupal.org"&gt;Drupal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://joomla.org"&gt;Joomla&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.mamboserver.com/"&gt;Mambo&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://plone.org"&gt;Plone&lt;/a&gt;.  They also looked at &lt;a href="http://www.interwoven.com/"&gt;Interwoven&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.reddot.com/"&gt;RedDot&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.crownpeak.com/"&gt;CrownPeak&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Redfin was looking for a de-coupled CMS that would allow them to separate content publishing from updating website code.  Of the open source products that they looked at, only Alfresco and Bricolage could do static publishing (I don't think they came across the &lt;a href="http://plone.org/products/cmfdeployment"&gt;CMFDeployment&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://plone.org/products/entransit"&gt;Enfold's Entransit&lt;/a&gt; project for Plone).  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What they didn't like about Alfresco was how index pages were generated.  They felt that they would need JSPs to dynamically render listing pages from directories of statically generated detail pages.  While listing pages can be statically generated through the same mechanism that renders detail pages, the fact that it happens at save time rather than publish time may have created performance problems if they had lots of composite pages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their main concern with Bricolage was similar to what most non-periodical websites experience: that the user interface metaphor is highly specialized to publishing stories and related media.  Business users need to mentally map the terminology of the product to their own domain model.  They also found the branching model unintuitive.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the Redfin development team is happy with their choice of Bricolage and it sounds like they will bring energy and expertise to the Bricolage community.</content>

    <title>Mambo, Joomla</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;A lot of people have been asking for my opinion about the recent events of a group of Mambo developers forking &lt;a href="http://www.mamboserver.com"&gt;Mambo&lt;/a&gt; into a new project &lt;a href="http://www.joomla.org/"&gt;Joomla&lt;/a&gt;.  For those of you who are just hearing the news, the basic story is that &lt;a href="http://www.miro.com.au/"&gt;Miro International&lt;/a&gt; (which originally developed Mambo, donated it to open source, then re-initiated interest and involvement in the project), formed a &lt;a href="http://www.mambo-foundation.org/"&gt;foundation&lt;/a&gt; to manage and own the project.  While the tactic of establishing a foundation &lt;a href="http://contenthere.blogspot.com/2005/06/zope-foundation.html"&gt;generally considered a noble and good thing&lt;/a&gt;, Miro alienated some key members of the Mambo development community by not giving them a voice in the foundation and being heavy handed in setting the direction.  As a result, some key developers exercised their right to fork the code and establish a new project.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reality of open source is that this type of thing happens from time to time.  In the open source content management world, look at the proliferation of Nuke projects that came out of PHP-Nuke.  Communities are self forming and self regulating and it takes strong and perceptive leadership to hold them together.  This is why we look at very closely at the leadership of a project when selecting open source software.   Still, it is a shame that this happened to Mambo because it felt like this project was on a roll.  After winning several awards and critical praise for ease of use, and with all the activity on &lt;a href="http://mamboforge.net/"&gt;Mambo Forge&lt;/a&gt; (a community of module developers), Mambo was getting a lot of attention.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what happens next?  In the short term, we are definitely in "wait and see" mode.  Joomla  has the buzz and the passion, and (I would say), the leadership.  Mambo has the infrastructure and the install base but Miro will probably have to step up their support of the project to replace the momentum lost by the departure of key developers.  Companies that jump from Mambo to Joomla will be pleased to know that many of the modules written for Mambo will work on Joomla, at least for now.  You can see a list of Joomla compatible modules &lt;a href="http://developer.joomla.org/sf/sfmain/do/listProjects/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  It may be that a lot of the module developers redirect their projects to Joomla if they are loyal to the Joomla group or if they feel like that is where the momentum is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tony Byrne, from &lt;a href="http://www.cmswatch.com"&gt;CMS Watch&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.cmswatch.com/Trends/520-Joomla!----Mambo-has-forked-and-created-yet-another-CMS"&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt; that Joomla will focus on adding new features - a slight deviation from Mambo's focus on simplicity which has served the project well.  It will be interesting to see the divergence between these projects.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I would not count out Mambo or Joomla, if you are looking for an open source LAMP based web CMS, and you were thinking about Mambo, I would also consider &lt;a href="http://ez.no/products/ez_publish_cms"&gt;eZ publish&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.typo3.com"&gt;TYPO3&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/"&gt;Midgard&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>I Use This</title>
    <content type='html'>I have been on a Mac since I started &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net"&gt;Content Here&lt;/a&gt; a little over a year ago.  The migration for me has been an unqualified success.  I won't go back.  Here is a list of apps that have made the experience that much more pleasurable.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Mail, Calendar, Address Book: Mac Apps&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to go with the Mac defaults: Mail.app, iCal, and Address Book.  Since these applications are pretty much always open, I wanted them to be stable, well integrated, lightweight, and just good enough.  They work as advertised and I have absolutely no complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Blogging: MarsEdit&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I started taking longer trips for client projects and conferences, I realized I needed an offline blogging tool.  For a while I used a simple text editor and then copy paste into the Blogger web UI.  Then I went to &lt;a href="http://infinite-sushi.com/software/ecto/"&gt;Ecto&lt;/a&gt; which I used for around a month until I got annoyed with its quirky notions about HTML.  I bitched a little on the support forums to no effect and then decided to vote with my feet and went over to &lt;a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/"&gt;MarsEdit&lt;/a&gt;, which I love.  It doesn't try to give you WYSIWYG editing features and that is OK by me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Simple Editor: TextMate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started out with &lt;a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/"&gt;TextWrangler&lt;/a&gt; because it's free.  I tried &lt;a href="http://www.macromates.com/"&gt;TextMate&lt;/a&gt; because I like to be able to set up "projects." Before I discovered you could set up a "disk browser" in TextWrangler, I fell in like with TextMate.  I seem to be in good company because I keep recognizing TextMate in screencasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;XML: oXygen&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I write my reports in XML (DocBook) so a good XML editor that validates as I type and runs my transforms is important to me.  I was disappointed to learn that &lt;a href="http://na.justsystems.com/content.php?page=xmetal"&gt;XMetaL&lt;/a&gt; doesn't work on the Mac.  I bought &lt;a href="http://www.oxygenxml.com/"&gt;oXygen&lt;/a&gt;.  I first used the Eclipse plugin but then I transfered my license to the stand-alone version, which is a lot faster.  I am pretty happy with it.  It comes with the &lt;a href="http://www.syncrosvnclient.com/"&gt;Syncro SVN Client&lt;/a&gt; which works well enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;IDE: Eclipse&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rarely do serious coding anymore but when I do, I use &lt;a href="http://eclipse.org"&gt;Eclipse&lt;/a&gt;.  Eclipse takes so long to load that it makes me think twice about whether I want to get sucked into my programming head and lose track of time for the next few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Source Control: SVN via Wush and the Syncro SVN Client&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Old habits are hard to break and I am a religious source control user for my website and my reports.  &lt;a href="http://wush.net/subversion.php"&gt;Wush.net&lt;/a&gt; takes care of the Subversion hosting.  Syncro is my client when I am not in a command line mood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Office: iWork&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I bought my Mac, I felt obligated to throw in a license for Microsoft Office.  Big mistake.   I thought I hated Office for Windows.  The Mac version is worse.  I am very happy with the iWork applications and tend to write deliverables and presentations in Pages and Keynote and then export to the Microsoft formats.  It is a good thing when your office applications don't suck your will to live.  I have &lt;a href="http://www.neooffice.org/neojava/en/index.php"&gt;NeoOffice&lt;/a&gt; installed for the occasional Open Document file I receive.  &lt;a href="http://www.petitiononline.com/appleodf/petition.html"&gt;It sure would be nice if iWork would support Open Document&lt;/a&gt;.  Maybe if both MS Office and iWork supported it, ODF would realize its vision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Drawing: OmniGraffle&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one Windows application that I thought I was going to miss was Visio.  Then I found &lt;a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/OmniGraffle/"&gt;OmniGraffle&lt;/a&gt; and I have moved on.  Although there are not as many stencils as Visio, you can read and write from Visio's XML format with relatively good accuracy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Image Capture: Command-Shift-4, Flickr, Skitch&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For work I look at a lot of software and I take a lot of screenshots.  Typically, I use the key command Command-Shift-4, then space to get a .png image of the active program saved to my desktop.  Then I upload the files to &lt;a href="http://flickr.com"&gt;Flickr&lt;/a&gt; and tag them appropriately.  After doing that for about a year, I have a nice little library of screenshots that is organized by keyword.  When I want to blog a picture immediately I tend to use &lt;a href="http://plasq.com/"&gt;Plasq software's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://skitch.com"&gt;Skitch&lt;/a&gt; because it lets me quickly post the picture with all my cheeky annotations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Browser: "CaminoFoxIfari"&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have absolutely no loyalties to any browser and I switch whenever the wind changes direction.  Today I am using Firefox 3 because I wanted read my feeds offline with Google Gears.  I think I like the Camino keyboard shortcuts the most though.  I also like how Safari and Camino share a password database.  For some reason I have been leaving &lt;a href="http://www.opera.com/"&gt;Opera&lt;/a&gt; out of my rotation.  I guess even fickleness has its limits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Time management: OfficeTime&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you run your own business, you need to be very careful to manage your time efficiently.  No one else is going to do it for you.  In addition to keeping track of billable hours, I also track time for internal projects including research, reports, conferences, blogging, and general admin.  &lt;a href="http://www.officetime.net/"&gt;OfficeTime&lt;/a&gt; is like a little stopwatch that you can start and stop when you work on different things.  There are reports that tell you how you spent your time today, yesterday, this week, last week....  I find that tracking time in this way helps keep me focused on doing the important work and prevents me from task switching inefficiently.   OfficeTime is not the prettiest application in the world but it works.  I even like the sound effect of the clock ticking for a second when you start it.  It gives a sense of urgency to get started on your task.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Accounting: QuickBooks&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.quickbooks.com"&gt;QuickBooks&lt;/a&gt; on a Mac is lame but my accountant uses QuickBooks so I am stuck with it.  The Windows version (which my accountant uses) is totally different from the Mac version but I can export a Windows friendly "Accountant's Copy" of my "Company File" and I can translate his bookkeeping instructions to the Mac UI.  I don't care enough about accounting software to switch even if there was a cooler Mac-oriented accounting package that could export a QuickBooks Company File to share with an accountant.  For personal finances, I use &lt;a href="http://www.mint.com"&gt;Mint&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Project Planning: Concept Draw Planner&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usually having a white computer gets you out of being responsible for making Gantt charts.  However, on the off chance that I need to put together a project Gantt chart, I use &lt;a href="http://www.conceptdraw.com/project/"&gt;Concept Draw Planner&lt;/a&gt;.  It's good enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Task Management: Things&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn't like the changes to iCal's task feature that came with the Leopard upgrade so I started to use &lt;a href="http://culturedcode.com/things"&gt;Things&lt;/a&gt;.   I organize my work into "Areas of Responsibility" like "blogging," "household," and "research" and "Projects" a particular client project.  Content entry is very quick and the "Next" view gives you a nice hit list of what to do when you have a free moment.  Amazing piece of software.  Try it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;FTP: Transmit&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like Panic Software's &lt;a href="http://www.panic.com/transmit"&gt;Transmit&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Bit Torrent: Transmission&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not saying that I use Bit Torrent but if I did, I would probably use a client like &lt;a href="http://www.transmissionbt.com/"&gt;Transmission&lt;/a&gt;. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Twitter/Friendfeed: Twhirl&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It just keeps on getting better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Chat/IM: Adium and Skype&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can get me on pretty much all of the IM services as sggottlieb.  Funny thing is that I have been using IM a lot less recently now that I use Twitter and Friendfeed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;IRC: Colloquy&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I am on IRC, I use &lt;a href="http://www.colloquy.info/"&gt;Colloquy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Mailing lists&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I subscribe to a bunch of open source mailing lists and the best tool for that is &lt;a href="http://www.gmail.com"&gt;Gmail&lt;/a&gt;.  I really like the rules feature so I can automatically delete some messages (like a build failing) and tag messages by the open source project that they are from.  I usually bulk read a project at a time to get caught up on what is going on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;My absolute favorite app isn't really an app.  It is an app launcher: Quicksilver&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quicksilver is a program that runs in the background.  When type Ctrl-Space, a little window pops up.  I start typing and Quicksilver filters down its index of files and applications on my computer.  For example, when I want to launch Camino, I hit Ctrl-space then "ca" and I see Camino.  Then I hit enter and Camino launches.  Or I type "web" and a bunch of files that have the word "web" in them pop-up including my slide presentation for &lt;a href="http://webcontent2008.com"&gt;WebContent2008&lt;/a&gt;.  That reminds me.  I have have to finish that presentation :).  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content>

    <title>Finally, Drupal Gets Deployment</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Greg Dunlap, over at &lt;a href="http://www.palantir.net"&gt;Palantir&lt;/a&gt;, has a post introducing &lt;a href="http://www.palantir.net/blog/bringing-deployment-capability-drupal"&gt;a new "Deploy" module for Drupal&lt;/a&gt;.  Most of the site design and behavior in &lt;a href="http://drupal.org"&gt;Drupal&lt;/a&gt; is controlled through configuration stored in the database (as opposed to files on the file system). The ability to move configurations from one Drupal environment to another (like development to staging to production) has been an achilles heel for Drupal.  You can't just copy the database because then you would overwrite your production data with your test data.  Assuming that you don't want to be developing on the live site, you had to choose between manually repeating your work on production or resorting to some awkward SQL scripting hacks to move database stored configurations from one database to another.  These scripts were always brittle because of Drupal's reliance on an an ID field that is auto-incrememented - it is hard to keep those ID sequences synchronized across different databases. Deploy is a welcome improvement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deploy works by allowing an administrator to create a "deployment plan" and extending other modules to give an option to add their configuration to the deployment plan.  When the administrator executes a deployment, Deploy grabs all the configurations and content that have been associated with the deployment plan plus their dependencies and pushes them to a target environment.  Greg's post has a nice screencast showing what it looks like to the user.  Behind the scenes, Deploy adds a global unique identifier (GUID) field (in some companion tables) that is used to match up corresponding rows in the different environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seems like Deploy falls short of addressing the common case where a deployment consists of a combination of configuration settings and content in the database and code in the file system.   Deploy is for database-managed configuration only.  For filesystem stuff, the handiest tool is a module called &lt;a href="http://drupal.org/project/drush"&gt;Drush&lt;/a&gt; that allows you manipulate a Drupal instance from the command line.  This allows you to create a script (preferably in &lt;a href="http://ant.apache.org/"&gt;Ant&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/"&gt;Make&lt;/a&gt;) to move files around and update a Drupal instance.  Maybe it would be possible to configure Deploy to &lt;em&gt;pull&lt;/em&gt; from another instance (rather than push).  That way Deploy could be scripted in Drush for a comprehensive (database and file system) update.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;These improvements are big steps in the right direction and reflect the impact of large companies running big and important Drupal sites.  I expect this aspect of Drupal to be steadily improved and become standard practice by Drupal developers.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Never say &amp;quot;User&amp;quot;</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Ever since I got into web content management, I have advised my clients to avoid the word "user."  It's a useless word because you are never quite sure if someone is talking about a &lt;em&gt;user&lt;/em&gt; of the CMS, or a &lt;em&gt;user&lt;/em&gt; of the website.  For this reason, I get my clients to adopt the words "contributor" and "visitor."  A contributor is a person that contributes content or participates in the content workflow of the content management system.  A visitor consumes content on the website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The primary goal of a content management system is to mediate between these two populations.  If a CMS was only to think of the contributor, the content would be poorly structured, cluttered, chaotically structured, and hard to find.  By the way, pretty much every organization has one of those systems &amp;mdash; it's called a shared drive.  If a CMS only represented the visitors (or other consumers of content such as other systems), it would insist on extremely fine-grain structure for maximum reuse, pristine HTML (sorry, no WYSIWYG editors), and perfect quality (hello 10 step workflows).  The CMS applies structure and rules to establish a compromise between these two groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Web 2.0-style sites jumble this model up a bit because the line between contributor and visitor are blurring.  Visitors can potentially contribute.  Web content management systems like Drupal, Plone and many others merge the contributor interface into the externally facing website.  These platforms tend to call registered users (contributors and visitors) "members" and, by default, allow members registered themselves.  The distinction between a self registered member and a "SuperUser" is just a matter of permissions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I still think that the distinction of contributor and visitor is useful because members need to wear different hats.  Sometimes they are visitors on the site simply trying find something.  Other times they are contributors wanting to post something.  The CMS is still mediating but instead of mediating between different types of users, it is potentially mediating between the same user in different contexts.  It forces the contributor to put in a little extra effort to make life easier when he becomes a visitor.  It would be a little like &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Assistant"&gt;Clippy&lt;/a&gt; telling you "Oh, you don't want to use that file name and place that document there because you will &lt;strong&gt;NEVER&lt;/strong&gt; find it again!  And while you are at it, maybe you should print that out because you messed with the margins and I bet its going to look like hell." Clippy doesn't do that and we still find him annoying.  Now you wonder why nobody loves their content management system?&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Why is the Content Management Industry Afraid of Google?</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Google is a fascinating company.  They are big, but &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/corporate/tenthings.html"&gt;not evil&lt;/a&gt;.  They have brilliant engineering.  They are &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/soc/"&gt;generous&lt;/a&gt;.  Most of all, however, Google is a very powerful enabler of change.  Their innovation inspires others to be innovative or at least copy.  Their API's are being used all over the web.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, despite all these great things about Google, why is it that I feel a palpable sense of fear within the content management community whenever they are mentioned?  Nobody thinks that Google will intentionally hurt anyone's business but there is a concern in a number of communities that Google will accidentally make them irrelevant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some examples:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The enterprise software market is threatened by Google's success with simplicity.  The philosophy of most business software (from desktop office suites to enterprise business applications like content management and ERP systems) is that features equal power.  With every release, an application is considered improved by addition of new features.  The fact that the number of features is directly related to complexity has been considered an acceptable consequence of having more powerful tools.  Google's success with a consumer oriented design philosophy of "less is more" is breaking that myth.  Business users are now asking "why can't this be simple like Google?"  It is going to take a long time for traditional enterprise software vendors to walk back the road they traveled to get to their current state of complexity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The fact that Google can deliver their services in a maintenance-free appliance make Google appealing to system administrators.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Content managers and librarians are threatened by Google's confidence in its indexing algorithms.  While the content management community has been advocating thoughtful organization of content and conscientious metadata entry, Google tells us that this is not necessary.  Just leave everything where it is and the Google algorithms will sort it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Google "one box" interface mocks the heavily designed but rarely used "advanced search" interface.  Most business users say they have an easier time finding things on the infinite, chaotic world wide web than they do on the fully controlled Intranet.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than fear Google's disruption in the content management field, I think this is a huge opportunity for improvement.  It is not like the content management industry has put an end to everyone's content management problems.  People are still struggling with the same things that they have been struggling with for years.  The only difference is that with the exponential grown of content, the stakes are higher.  This disruption should force us to challenge our assumptions and the way we do things.  I can't tell you how many times I have heard someone defend Intranet search engines with the claim that they have the disadvantage of less link relationships to help a Google style hub/authority algorithm work.  Why not look for ways to improve linking like having an internal social bookmarking and blogging platform?  I am waiting to see a software brochure bragging about the things the product &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;does not do&lt;/span&gt; and why.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think that we should start taking questions of "why does it need to be so complicated?" more seriously.  Maybe it does need to be complicated or labor intensive but we should have a solid reason.  It should no longer be enough to tousle their hair and condescendingly say "because these are grownup tools."&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Is Drupal the right platform for whitehouse.gov?</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;By now, most people have heard that &lt;a href="http://buytaert.net/whitehouse-gov-using-drupal"&gt;whitehouse.gov has been migrated over to Drupal&lt;/a&gt;.  Apparently, the administration has built a level of comfort with the platform with &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2009/02/the-significance-of-recovergov-on-drupal.html"&gt;its experience using it for recovery.gov&lt;/a&gt;.  While the Drupal community is doing high fives all around and equating this with being the most powerful CMS in the free world, I wouldn't go that far.  I would say that Drupal is a very good choice for powering the kind of website that the Obama administration is trying to foster: content rich, news oriented, faceted, and populist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apparently, &lt;a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2233719"&gt;Slate Magazine's Chris Wilson wasn't so generous with his critique of the choice&lt;/a&gt;.  I discovered the Slate article by reading Conor McNamara's excellent post&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.databasepublish.com/blog/messengers-errors-chris-wilsons-flawed-rant-about-drupal-and-whitehousegov"&gt;"Drupal misrepresented by Chris Wilson of slate.com."&lt;/a&gt;  In my opinion, Conor's responses to Wilson's points are spot-on.  Some of Wilson's criticisms reflect configuration choices, not limitations of the platform (like not being able to add Javascript to a content objects.  It's a bad idea to allow this by the way.). &lt;a href="http://buytaert.net/slate-fr-using-drupal"&gt;Slate.fr uses Drupal&lt;/a&gt; and the Today's Pictures section of Slate.com is Drupal powered.  It seems like Chris has just enough knowledge to sound ignorant. Readers of my reports know that I can get critical of technologies.  But whenever I criticize, I make sure to do my research because I know that I am going to get attacked by defenders of that technology.  Chris is about to learn this lesson. If Slate.com's commenting system wasn't so bad, he would learn even faster.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Migrating from commercial to open source CMS</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I just saw a post on the &lt;a href="http://www.bricolage.cc"&gt;Bricolage&lt;/a&gt; developer list asking if anyone has any experience migrating from &lt;a href="http://www.vignette.com"&gt;Vignette&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="http://www.bricolage.cc"&gt;Bricolage&lt;/a&gt;. I don't know the context of this migration but I am definitely seeing a trend.  Two of our current customers are hanging up their mid/upper tier WCM licenses in favor of simpler open source applications.  We have one customer who is migrating from &lt;a href="http://www.percussion.com/"&gt;Rhythmyx&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="http://plone.org"&gt;Plone&lt;/a&gt; and another customer who decided not to use their corporate standard of &lt;a href="http://www.fatwire.com"&gt;FatWire&lt;/a&gt; for a new web property they are launching.  They are using Bricolage.  Interestingly, cost was not the primary factor.  Both clients wanted to have something simple to use and and easy to extend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>HTML production for CMS implementations</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Most new site CMS implementations (as opposed to site migrations from one CMS to another) start off with a set of HTML mockups.  This can be a convenient starting place because, in addition to showing how the pages should look and informing the content model, having the HTML gives a good head start to presentation template development.  Ideally the template developer just has to replace the sample "Lorem Ipsum" text with a tagging syntax that retrieves real content from the repository.  There are even some graphical tools that help a developer map regions on the mockup with content from the repository.  However, often moving from HTML mockups to presentation templates isn't so smooth.  Sometimes the HTML has to be re-written from the ground up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most common source of problems is when the HTML is too specific.  This usually occurs when the designer/developer who produces the mockups is accustomed building static HTML websites where she has full control over everything.  HTML and CSS for an CMS implementation has to account for the fact that control is shared between the template and the content contributor.  While the template controls the overall layout, the control contributor controls the navigation, text, images, and (with the help of a rich text editor) can even style body content.  HTML code that is rigid and brittle breaks when stretched by unanticipated content.  Here are some things to look out for.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hard coded height and width dimensions on image tags&lt;/strong&gt;.  Most content contributors don't know the first thing about aspect ratios.  They upload a picture and don't understand why it is squished on the page.  While most CMS these can automatically scale images (and even if they can't the browser will), they can't all reshape them.  While some CMS support cropping functionality for thumbnails, few content contributors know how to use it to precisely shape an image.  I usually recommend setting only one dimension (usually width) and then letting the other dimension (usually the height) do what it needs to do.  If you really need to control both, you can use this little background image trick:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;br/&gt;   &amp;lt;div class="picture" style="background: url(&amp;lt;&amp;lt;horizontally scaled image path&amp;gt;&amp;gt;) no-repeat; height:150px;"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This uses the image CMS's image scaling to set the width and vertically crops the image after 150 pixels by making it a background image.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overusing element ids&lt;/strong&gt;.  When you are only building a few pages and you want very direct control over elements, there is a temptation to code CSS to reference specific element ids rather than classes.  In some cases, this makes sense.  For example, when there is only one global left navigation component.  However, it makes less sense for anything that a content contributor might have control over &amp;mdash; like items in that navigational menu or anything else that repeats.  I haven't used DreamWeaver (DreadWeaver, as I like to say) in years but I suspect that the HTML/CSS auto-generation generation prefers using IDs over classes because that is where I see it the most.  The worst case I have seen was a sample search result page with every search result individually styled with element ids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Over-complicated HTML.&lt;/strong&gt;  HTML is only going to get more complicated when it is infused with template syntax.  It is best to start with HTML code that is as simple and terse as it can be.  If a designer is still using nested tables to position things, have him work in photoshop.  The more styling you can do in CSS the better.  This will make templates cleaner, more efficient, and easier to manage.  Plus, your CSS will survive a migration to another CMS better than your template code will.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using images rather than text headings&lt;/strong&gt;.  While the font control afforded by images is nice, avoid using images for anything dealing with the navigation or page names.  Otherwise content contributors will not be able to create new pages or re-organize the navigation without a designer to produce images.  If you have a top level navigation that is unlikely to change, you can compromise by building images just for the top level page names.  A decent strategy is to code the HTML like&lt;br/&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &amp;lt;h1 class="section-heading &amp;lt;&amp;lt;dynamic section name in lowercase &amp;gt;&amp;gt;"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;sectionname&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br/&gt;for example:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &amp;lt;h1 class="section-heading about"&amp;gt;About&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This way, if a content contributor introduces a new section that doesn't have an image or style yet, there is a decent fallback of styled text.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Too many layouts&lt;/strong&gt;.  Most web content management systems prefer you to have an overall page layout template (also known as a master page) that is used for nearly all of the pages of the site and then content-type-specific templates that render in the "content area" in the center of the page. Things like the header, footer and global navigation components go in the page layout template.  In many systems these two templates are not very much aware of each other because they are rendered at different times within the page generation process.  The trick is to determine what portions of the page to put in the global template and what to put in the content-type specific templates.  The more you put in the content-specific templates, the more flexibility you have but you also wind up having redundant code that adds management overhead.  You also want to make sure that the design does not specify too many options for content presentation templates.  In addition to adding to maintenance overhead, this also confuses the user.  When lots of variability is required, it is a good technique to design the implementation to allow contributors to build pages with blocks of content.  This way, the presentation template just has to define "slots" that contributors can fill (or not fill) with content.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of these tips will come more naturally to an advanced HTML that really knows his stuff than a pure designer with design tools that can create HTML.  However, even the best HTML developers can have mental lapses when they get into a production groove.  It is a good idea to understand the HTML producer's skill-set before assigning the task of HTML production and set expectations.  Otherwise, you will probably get a rude awakening when template development is scheduled to start.  If this type of HTML production is new to your team and you would like them to learn it, account for this learning by holding frequent reviews of the HTML code as it being produced.  Start with the most simple content type (like a generic page) so you can focus on the global page layout and get alignment on static vs. variable components.  Over time, your team will instinctively notice HTML code that works for the mockup but will be problematic in a presentation template. &lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Django Action Item Follow Up</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;While moderating a comment on my "&lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2009/11/10-django-master-class-action-items.html"&gt;10 Django Master Class action items&lt;/a&gt;" post, I was inspired to evaluate how I am doing on these action items and whether they are helping.  Below is a brief summary of my progress; but first a little background.  Recently, I had the rare opportunity to rebuild (from the ground up) an application that I wrote for a client.  The context was that the first version of the application was a prototype that I built to help demonstrate an idea to potential investors and customers.  The prototype served its purpose excellently.  It was able to evolve alongside the idea as my client got feedback and refined the value proposition.  We came out of the prototyping phase with a strong vision and an excited group of investors and beta customers.  To minimize costs I avoided refactoring the application and cut a lot of corners.  By the end of the prototype phase, the idea had changed so much that we were really faking functionality by overloading different features.  Still, for a ridiculously small investment, my client was able to develop and market test an idea.  And now I get to build the application for real and apply the best practices that I learned about in the Django master class.  Here is what I am doing and how it is working out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use South for database migrations (adopted).&lt;/strong&gt;  I have grown so attached to South that I find it hard to imagine life without it.  This is especially important because I am managing different environments and the object model is changing as I add new features.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use PostgreSQL rather than MySQL (adopted).&lt;/strong&gt;  I am steadily getting more comfortable with PosgreSQL.  &lt;a href="http://www.pgadmin.org/"&gt;pgAdmin&lt;/a&gt; has been really helpful as I get up to speed with the syntactical differences from MySQL.  So far, the biggest differences have been in user management and permissions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use VirtualEnv (adopted).&lt;/strong&gt;  VirtualEnv + &lt;a href="http://www.doughellmann.com/projects/virtualenvwrapper/"&gt;VirtualEnv Wrapper&lt;/a&gt; has been great.  For a little while I was working on both the prototype and the actual application.  VirtualEnv made it easy for me to switch back and forth.  This will also be helpful when I upgrade to Django 1.2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use PIP (adopted)&lt;/strong&gt;.  I really like how you can do a "pip freeze" to create a requirements file that you can use to build up an environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Break up functionality into lots of small re-usable applications (adopted)&lt;/strong&gt;.  The prototype had one app.  The production app that I am building has 6.  One of the apps contains all the branding for the application and some tag libraries.  Templates in other apps load a base template from my "skin" app.  The best part of using this strategy is in testing and database migrations because you can test and migrate a project one app at a time.  The hardest thing for me to figure out is how to manage inter-dependencies and coupling.  One strategy that has worked well for me is to focus dependencies on just a couple of applications.  For example, I have profile application which manages user profiles (extended from the base django.contrib.auth.User model.).  I have other apps that relate to people but I am careful to create foreign key relationships to the User model rather than my profile model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use Fabric for deployments (adopted).&lt;/strong&gt;  One word.  AWESOME!  I have scripts to set up a server and deploy my project without having to ssh onto the server.  The scripts were not that hard to write.  I took inspiration from some great posts (&lt;a href="http://lincolnloop.com/blog/2009/sep/22/easy-fabric-deployment-part-1-gitmercurial-and-ssh/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://morethanseven.net/2009/07/27/fabric-django-git-apache-mod/wsgi-virtualenv-and-p.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).  Now I can reliably push code (and media) with one local command.  I am managing the development of another site running a PHP CMS and I am strongly considering having the team use Fabric for that as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use Django Fixtures (adopted)&lt;/strong&gt;.  Managing fixtures in JSON has turned out to be really easy.  I typically have two fixtures for each app: initial_data.json and &amp;lt;app_name&amp;gt;_test_data.json.  initial_data.json mainly contains data for lookup tables.  It is run automatically when syncdb (the Django command to update the database schema) is run.  I typically create these files with the dumpdata command and then edit them manually.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Look into the Python Fixture module (not adopted)&lt;/strong&gt;.  I looked into this module but, to be honest, editing the JSON files is pretty easy so I don't see the need for it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use django.test.TestCase more for unit testing (adopted).&lt;/strong&gt; I have been doing a considerable amount of test driven development (TDD).  It all started when I wanted to rewrite the core functionality but I needed to wait for someone else to re-build the HTML in the presentation templates.  Now I have around 130 unit tests that I run before I commit any code.  Focusing on unit testing has made me write code that is more atomic and easier to test.  Now I think "how will I test this?" before I write any code.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use the highest version of Python that you can get away with (adopted).&lt;/strong&gt;  A big motivator for me here was when I upgraded my workstation to Snow Leopard which ships with Python 2.6.3.  Getting 2.6.3 on my server was a little more complicated.  I wound up using a host that comes with Ubuntu Karmic Koala which also comes with 2.6.3.  I am really pleased with Ubuntu and it seems like most of the Django community is going that way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;I feel really lucky for the opportunity to rewrite an application and apply lessons learned.  Too often you are stuck managing code that you (or someone else) wrote before you knew what you were doing.  That is, before the functionality of the application was fully understood; before a feature of the API was available or known; before a more elegant solution was discovered.  I am sure that I will continue to learn new things and want to apply them and I plan to continually refactor as long as I am involved with this project.  But this full-reset has been a great experience. &lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>On Building an API</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;A few months ago &lt;a href="http://www.lionbridge.com/lionbridge-releases-first-translation-api-content-types-translation-levels/"&gt;we announced the availability of the Lionbridge onDemand Public API&lt;/a&gt;.  While there are many translation APIs in the marketplace, I think that ours is the most comprehensive.  Most translation APIs offer one level of translation quality (for example, machine translation or crowd translation or professional translation).  The onDemand API allows you to &lt;a href="http://api-docs.liondemand.com/list_services.html"&gt;select a translation type&lt;/a&gt; that meets your needs.  This means that you can integrate with one API and give your customers lots of options.  We also support many different content types. For example, we can translate videos as well as basic documents. Lastly, we offer different payment options. The end customer can pay themselves or the money can flow through our integration partner.  I think these differentiators are responsible for the rapid adoption we are seeing.  We already have around ten third party  integrations in production or nearing completion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Personally, this has been a huge learning experience.  While I have used many APIs and even helped developed a couple, this is the first time that I designed one from a blank page.   The sheer number of approaches, options, and details that you face is enormous.  And although the biases formed from personal experience are important, what really matters is the developer audience &amp;mdash; not just in the decisions you make but also how you support them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hate the term best practice but here are some of the things we got right. I must admit that we didn't always land on all of these practices the first time but when we adopted them, we definitely saw results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learn from others.&lt;/strong&gt; When first designing the API, I drew inspiration from other APIs that I liked to use.  I also found great information from George Reese's &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00890OBFI/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00890OBFI&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=contenthere-20&amp;linkId=GDECYWDXGYDXIGIO"&gt;The REST API Design Handbook&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=contenthere-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00890OBFI" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get feedback.&lt;/strong&gt; When first designing the API, I had the benefit of knowing who the first customers would be.  I wrote the initial specification in a Google Doc and invited feedback.  The first partners caught some important omissions and had some great ideas too.  I also had different developers review the specification before development started.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be pragmatic about change.&lt;/strong&gt;  An API is a contract. It shouldn't change.  However, in the early going there were a few cases where it made sense to change the specification.  This was inconvenient and awkward for developers who are starting their integrations.  However, it was much less painful than making changes later when the install base is bigger and changes would break working systems.  Managing these changes requires a lot of humility (admitting you are not perfect) and effort to rebuild trust.  Once the lead integration partner was getting close to being feature complete, however, we did lock down the version of the API and saved our changes for subsequent versions.  Since the initial launch of the API to our beta partners, we have launched another version and are &lt;a href="http://api-docs.liondemand.com/dev/"&gt;now working on a third&lt;/a&gt;.  We handle versioning with an HTTP header so it is easy for a client application to update the version to get access to the new feature.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hire your first client.&lt;/strong&gt;  While any early beta customer will need to accept some level of instability, you don't want to risk a partnership with your earliest growing pains.  For this reason, we hired a contract PHP programmer to develop and test code samples for working with the API.  This external developer had no more access than a true partner developer would have.  The experiences of this developer gave tremendous insight.  It exposed ambiguity in the documentation where the API implementer interpreted different meaning than an external reader.  It revealed cases where the test passed but externally developed code didn't work. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Give client developers a plan of action.&lt;/strong&gt;  Like with most API's the hardest part of working with the onDemand API is authentication.  For this reason, we recommend a development sequence that starts with the easiest API: &lt;a href="http://api-docs.liondemand.com/list_services.html"&gt;List Services&lt;/a&gt;.  We also wrote up &lt;a href="https://support.liondemand.com/hc/en-us/articles/201095990-Writing-your-first-API-Call"&gt;a quick tutorial with a code sample to help&lt;/a&gt;.  For our beta developers, we created a project plan template that developers could follow.  It contained tasks for integrating with the various features and rough time estimates.  I was surprised to learn how much the developers liked this.  Personally, I hate being given a project plan that I had no input over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Provide fanatical support.&lt;/strong&gt; Even though I love software development, I am the first to admit it can be frustrating.  It is easy for developers to get bogged down and stuck. The smoothest implementations we have had were when the dev team actively engaged the client developers.  I admit that sometimes I felt like my time was being stretched too thin.  But when you think about it, how can you get more leverage than helping a partner use your service and bring you business?  I also enjoyed working with external developers.  First of all, they are savvier than regular business users so you can rule out silly things like being disconnected from the Internet. Second, it was fun to troubleshoot with them as they sent requests and we inspected what onDemand received.  Pinpointing errors can save a client developer a lot of time.  This work had the side benefit of improving our error handling to provide more informative responses.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Treat your development sandbox like production.&lt;/strong&gt;  This should sound obvious but a lot of services that I have integrated with have very unstable developer sandboxes.  They are not always available and they have issues that you don't see in production.  There is nothing more frustrating than trying to fix your code and realizing that the problem is in an external system you are integrating with.  For this reason, we manage the sandbox as a production environment.  It gets the same monitoring as a production environment and we release new code to sandbox &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; it has been in production for a couple of days.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Test like you mean it.&lt;/strong&gt; Software is incredibly picky about the slightest detail so API testing needs to be extremely thorough.  You can't just verify that you are getting data back.  The data you get back needs to be precisely like what is in the documentation.  For this reason we do what I call double-blind testing.  The development team writes tests that run whenever new code is merged into the integration branch.  An external QA team writes and runs tests based on the documentation whenever we have a release candidate.  The hope is that having two independent approaches will everything.  When it doesn't, we have a major debrief.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build visibility through success.&lt;/strong&gt;  It is not easy to bring attention to your API.  But one thing that we did not do is invest in marketing hype to get the word out.  The person who will be choosing what API to use is a developer who is less easily swayed by traditional B2B marketing tactics.  The best case is to make your integration partners successful and build visibility that way.  I love to hear our early integrations talk about their translation feature.  The better we can make the developer experience (through reliability, documentation, support, and service quality) the more quality relationships we will build.  I would much rather see a positive mention in Stack Overflow (not there yet, but I can dream!) than a bunch of paid search ads.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you do it right, an API can revolutionize your business by opening channels that extend your reach.  But getting it right requires commitment and attention to detail.  If you underperform in any aspect (design, implementation, or support) your program is doomed. You won't always get everything right but if you maintain your focus and address your failures, you can get things back on track.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>AJAX: thick client feel in a thin client wrapper</title>
    <content type='html'>Unfortunately, I missed Tuesday's &lt;a href="http://www.bostonphp.org/"&gt;Boston PHP User Group&lt;/a&gt; meeting because it was an excellent one.  Our own Steve Zimmerman, along with Gabe Ricard from &lt;a href="http://www.imaxwebsolutions.com/"&gt;iMaxWebSolutions.com&lt;/a&gt;, Max Carlson from &lt;a href="http://www.openlazlo.org/"&gt;OpenLazlo&lt;/a&gt;, and Adam Peller from &lt;a href="http://www.ibm.com/"&gt;IBM&lt;/a&gt; all talked about AJAX.  My colleague, Eric Shea, took notes and &lt;a href="http://www.eshea.net/2006/02/ajax-thick-client-feel-in-thin-client.html"&gt;posted them on his blog&lt;/a&gt;.</content>

    <title>Please Update the Wikipedia List of Content Management Systems Page</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit: Please disregard this post.  I tried to add a product to the list and it was rejected.  Looks like I am going with a Google Doc.  Anyone want to re-invent the wheel with me?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Lionbridge, when we scope and propose a &lt;a href="http://www.globalmarketingops.com/"&gt;Global Marketing Operations&lt;/a&gt; solution, we need to learn about the publishing infrastructure.  I have been training our sales engineers to do some initial CMS analysis including what platform is being used and how.  One very important data point is the software version the customer is running - in particular, how current it is.  Running outdated software may indicate that the infrastructure has been neglected and may require some optimization in order to achieve efficiency goals - or it could just mean that the newest version features did not justify an upgrade.  That is OK too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I started to put together a public Google spreadsheet that lists the most common CMSs and the current version (why not share it with everyone?).  Then I decided to do one better and see if there was something already out there that I could help maintain.  Sure enough, there is a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_content_management_systems"&gt;Wikipedia page dedicated to listing CMS products and versions&lt;/a&gt;.  The data is pretty current and I made a couple updates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you specialize in a particular CMS (as a vendor, systems integrator, or customer), please update the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_content_management_systems"&gt;Wikipedia page&lt;/a&gt; with what you know.  I know editing wiki tables is painful but I think that everyone would benefit from having access to current and accurate information.  If there is a critical mass of people who prefer to manage this in a Google spreadsheet, I would be happy to participate in that effort as well.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Django Contrib</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://jacobian.org"&gt;Jacob Kaplan-Moss&lt;/a&gt; wrote very &lt;a href="http://jacobian.org/writing/what-is-django-contrib/"&gt;good post on the purpose of django.contrib&lt;/a&gt;.  For those unfamiliar with the &lt;a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/"&gt;Django project&lt;/a&gt;, django.contrib is a tightly managed, highly used collection of modules (packages in Python).  Contrib is not quite Django core, but much more part of Django than the &lt;a href="http://djangoplugables.com/"&gt;free-for-all of shared re-usable applications&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The reason why I find this interesting is that many open source projects struggle with the balance between the benefits and risks of maintaining a low bar to contribution.  The generally adopted policy is to keep core development within a small trusted group of "committers" (who can commit their own and patches by others that they have reviewed) and then open up module development to rest of the world.  What usually happens is that modules can be highly redundant and inconsistent on quality.  Add-on modules are typically the greatest cause for system instability and insecurity and the most difficult to upgrade.  But they are still great because they are code that you don't need to write.  &lt;a href="http://drupal.org"&gt;Drupal&lt;/a&gt;, with its explosive community growth, struggles with this balance.  Drupal developers often find that it is easier to write a module than to find one that is well written and does what you need it to do.  Yes, there are Drupal modules that rise to the top and eventually get included into the core (&lt;a href="http://drupal.org/project/views"&gt;Views&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://drupal.org/project/cck"&gt;CCK&lt;/a&gt;, etc.), but they are rare.  Sometimes there are random reversals - remember when CCK overtook &lt;a href="http://drupal.org/project/flexinode"&gt;flexinode&lt;/a&gt;?.  The rest churn in the rough and tumble &lt;a href="http://drupal.org/project/Modules"&gt;Contributed Modules library&lt;/a&gt;.  Other projects have these issue, Drupal's growth and scale just make it more visible.  &lt;a href="http://typo3.org"&gt;Typo3&lt;/a&gt; had a rating system ("no cigar" through "Cohiba") but the initiative fizzled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Back to Jacob and django.contrib...  Contrib is a very important resource for the Django community.  The packages there are widely used and considered (by many) as good as core Django code.  If a developer finds a module he needs in contrib, he will use it rather than any other comparable module he finds elsewhere.  Contrib modules are actively maintained and are tested against new versions of the core.  They are "sanctioned" not just for what they do but how they are built.  In his post, Jacob recognizes the impact of incorporating a package into contrib and tries to clarify what incorporation means.  Jacob proposes three tests to determine whether a package gets into contrib: the functionality should be optional (that is Django won't break if you delete contrib from your system), it solves a common problem, and it exemplifies generally accepted best practices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jacob also writes that contrib packages should conform to the same standards and guidelines for the general module population.  For example, they shouldn't access Django's "brittle internals" (that is, functionality not wrapped in an API that may change without warning).  The rest of the post goes through examples of packages that should or not be in contrib according to his tests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I think more projects should have a system like django.contrib or at least have an open discussion around what makes a preferred module.  As Typo3 found, it is hard to instate one after the catalog of modules (and community of developers) has grown beyond a certain size.  Putting the best modules into core carries the risk of bloating the core application with functionality that not everyone needs.  The various Linux distributions that have package managers are able to put preferred modules in their package library (accessible through tools like port and yum).  The last resort, which is where most big projects are, is to have a good network of developers and do your research from word of mouth.</content>

    <content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://www.nuxeo.com"&gt;Nuxeo's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://blogs.nuxeo.com/sections/blogs/ian_smith"&gt;Ian Smith&lt;/a&gt; has a great post about &lt;a href="http://blogs.nuxeo.com/sections/blogs/ian_smith/2009_01_06_open-source-what-learned-in-school"&gt;what it takes to be successful in open source software.&lt;/a&gt; The general premise is that most of the "analysis", "algorithms" and "design" skills that one learns in computer science programs are less relevant now that you can assemble applications out of various components. To be a good open source developer, Ian writes, one has to excel at interpreting information about software, understanding what components are likely to work nicely together, communicating, and knowing the landscape of different open source sources. Ian has a great picture showing the dependencies of 100's of components and makes the point that selecting and managing these disparate technologies is a real challenge for a modern software vendor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The argument reminds me of a theme that I have been hearing since I entered the industry: how much technical understanding of the underlying technology is required to be an effective user of that technology. When I started, purists were skeptical of computer science degrees. They wanted hard core electrical engineers that understood computer design and function at the most primitive levels. Later, computer science degrees were considered a requirement. Of course, with my undergraduate education in &lt;a href="http://web1.fandm.edu/admission/explore/English_Literature/"&gt;English Literature&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://web1.fandm.edu/admission/explore/Economics/"&gt;Economics&lt;/a&gt; and my graduate work in &lt;a href="http://www.nicholas.duke.edu/programs/professional/mem.html"&gt;Environmental Management&lt;/a&gt;, I kept pretty quiet on the subject[&lt;a href="#f1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;]. My current feeling is that, to be effective, you always need to more than what was included in the formal education of your curriculum. Ian probably takes for granted all of the "'analysis,' 'algorithms,' and 'design'" skills that he learned in school as he struggled up the learning curve of his job as an open source developer. Someone without Ian's computer science training (like me) would have to pay his dues getting a computer science degree equivalency on the job. As a technologist that assembles components, you do need to dip into the code and understand how things work. Sometimes the glue that holds things together requires some well conceived engineering too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The big idea in this post is not about the training of the individual but about how companies compete. When the parts are freely available, the competitive advantage hinges on what components and frameworks to use and how to manage the un-synchronized life-cycles of all that software. Configuration and release management becomes immensely complicated with all those moving parts and the companies that can manage that complexity will have a clear advantage. As companies shift their emphasis from developing to assembling, this challenge will become a more visible issue in the industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[&lt;a name="f1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;1] My journey from those disciplines to my current career is a long story.</content>

    <title>Social media, where you can stick it</title>

I realized that I have been unconsciously operating an elaborate decision tree of what to post where.  On a whim, I tried to map it out and I found the results interesting.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A couple of notes...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The FriendFeed (ff) icons shows what services are aggregated into FriendFeed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am just starting to use Tumblr again as a sort of personal blog.  This exercise helped me realize a use of Tumblr.  For a while, I was posting things directly into FriendFeed.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Flickr contains work and personal items.  I use it for personal pictures (mostly public) and also screen captures of software that I review (kept private).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am wondering if anyone else operates a similar decision tree and how conscious they are of it.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Attending Django Master Class</title>
    <content type='html'>I am looking forward to attending a &lt;a href="http://holdenweb.com/py/djangomaster/"&gt;Django Master Class, taught by Jacob Kaplan-Moss, on October 16th in Springfield, Virginia&lt;/a&gt;.  I have been building a prototype application for a client in Django over the last couple of months and have been very impressed with the framework.  It looks like the application will be going to Beta soon so it will be great to pick up some expert tricks that will take me to the next level.</content>

    <title>New Look for Content Here</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;If you recently clicked through to &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net"&gt;Content Here&lt;/a&gt;, you may have noticed that some changes are afoot.  Most obvious is that I have retired my old site theme.  The old theme has served me well (starting on Blogger and now on WordPress) but it is time to move on.  Special thanks to &lt;a href="http://www.lacdesign.com/"&gt;Leslie Charles from LAC Design&lt;/a&gt; for her help with the design.  Less obvious is migration onto a different web host with hopes of some improved performance.  I perceived a small improvement.  Please let me know what you think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even bigger news is coming soon: in the very near future I will be announcing a new report series.  &lt;strong&gt;So stay tuned!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Plone stands up to Tsunami</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.enfoldsystems.com"&gt;Enfold Systems&lt;/a&gt; recently &lt;a href="http://www.enfoldsystems.com/About/News/oxfam"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; how Oxfam's &lt;a href="http://www.plone.org"&gt;Plone&lt;/a&gt;-based website helped Oxfam respond to the Tsunami tragedy by rapidly publishing information about relief efforts and raising $14 million in donations.  The article also discusses how nicely the system scaled to the increased traffic.  From the article:&lt;blockquote&gt;When the Tsunami crisis occurred, the system was put to the test. "In the course of ten days during the Tsunami crisis, Oxfam had almost half of its typical yearly visits, and almost 1/3 of its yearly bandwidth - the system performed beautifully", said Internet Manager Nicholas Rabinowitz. "Our public website offered timely, critical content to our users, while providing a solid gateway to our online donation system."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wiki software &lt;a href="http://www.mediawiki.org"&gt;Media Wiki&lt;/a&gt; is also playing a prominent role in Tsunami relief by powering the collaborative information sharing website &lt;a href="http://www.tsunamihelp.info/wiki/index.php/Main_Page"&gt;Tsunami Help&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type='html'>Seth, &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is a great post and I think you are right.  Like the last poster you are going to deal with emotional resistance when it comes to puting email in its proper place.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am wokring on a CMS project as we speak.  Email is a huge part of workflow.  One of my goals is not to eliminate email from the workflow but change how its used... If I try to eliminate it I&amp;#39;m in trouble because people will keep using email and stop using CMS.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I want to allow email to keep the two following responsibilities:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Users will be able to file content via email.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Users will be able to participate in workflow via email by recieving notifications.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The days of passing documents around with email are, if I can help it over.&lt;br&gt;I need to allow people to file content via email.  Its technically problematic for me because I miss out on information capture etc but I have reporters who are running around all over the world, sometimes in dangerous places and they need the absolute lowest barrier to entry when it comes to getting the story in and moving on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The point you made about execs carrying blackbarries and being able to Yes or No is key here to.  OK thats the way they work and for many of them becoming emailers was a big deal.  Now I am going to ask them to stop emailing? Nope.  Im going to send them and email which says approve change X and Y or go hear to view the document as a page, and finally the option to go to the CMS and manipulate the content.  In any case it puts email in the messager role.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&amp;#39;m not an expert on CMS.  I am still trying to figure it out.  But it seems to me CMS isn&amp;#39;t about a system composed of a single node in all cases. In our case we have atleast a node (logically) for content repository, print publishing, web publishing site management, and sigh email.</content>

    <title>New Open Source Marketing Company</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://sandro.groganz.com/"&gt;Sandro Groganz&lt;/a&gt; just announced on &lt;a href="http://sandro.groganz.com/weblog/"&gt;his blog&lt;/a&gt; the formation of his new &lt;a href="http://sandro.groganz.com/wiki/Category:Open_Source_Marketing"&gt;open source marketing&lt;/a&gt; company. His target market includes commercial open source vendors, third party contributors, and investors in open source technology. All three of these groups could definitely use Sandro's help. He is still working on a name for the company and if you have any ideas, please send them to Sandro (what an open source way to start a company!).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you don't already know Sandro, he was an VP of Communications at &lt;a href="http://ez.no/"&gt;eZ systems&lt;/a&gt; and recently worked as the VP of Marketing at MindQuarry. Sandro knows the nuances of open source based business as well as anyone that I know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Best of luck Sandro!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content>

    <title>Jackalope: A PHP Port of the JCR</title>
    <content type='html'>Kas Thomas (from &lt;a href="http://www.day.com"&gt;Adobe/Day&lt;/a&gt;) writes that a &lt;a href="http://dev.day.com/content/ddc/blog/2010/12/a_php_port_of_jcr.html"&gt;PHP port of the JCR (called Jackalope) is near completion.&lt;/a&gt; A big part of the project was to translate the JCR specification (which, like Java, is statically typed) to PHP's dynamic typing model.  The result is a derivative specification called the &lt;a href="https://github.com/jackalope/phpcr/blob/master/doc/JCR_TO_PHPCR.txt"&gt;PHPCR&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PHP developers have had access to JCR repositories for quite some time through &lt;a href="http://sling.apache.org/site/index.html"&gt;Apache Sling&lt;/a&gt; (which puts a nice REST interface in front of a JCR).  What &lt;a href="https://fosswiki.liip.ch/display/jackalope/Home"&gt;Jackalope&lt;/a&gt; brings to the table is a PHP-based, in-process API that may be faster than hitting a REST interface.  However, that doesn't mean PHP developers can totally forget about Java.  The current implementation is an adaptor that connects to a JCR (&lt;a href="http://jackrabbit.apache.org/"&gt;Apache JackRabbit&lt;/a&gt;) through webDAV (so http is still in the mix too).  The next phase of development will swap out the JCR storage backend with a basic database thereby removing the JVM from the picture entirely.</content>

    <title>New ECM Interoperability Standard Proposal on AIIM</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;There is a new proposal for a &lt;a href="http://www.aiim.org/standards.asp?ID=29284"&gt;standards based Services Oriented Architecture Framework for Interoperable Enterprise Content Management&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href="http://www.aiim.org"&gt;AIIM web site&lt;/a&gt;.  AIIM is the "international authority on Enterprise Content Management."  The initiative is being lead by Paul Fontaine of the US Department of Transportation and Mike Connor of Adobe. If successful, this standard will enable companies to share content across different content management systems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back in 2000, the ECM industry's position was that effective content management could only be provided by large centralized monolithic applications.  This development is interesting because it is another sign that ECM vendors are turning away from the business of providing a single unified (one size fits none) solution for all of an organization's diverse content management needs.  If successful, these standards will allow organizations to select best of breed technologies that meet the specific needs of business processes without sacrificing content reuse and cross departmental information sharing.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a number of other standards that will also be effective in implementing interoperable content architectures.  The Java Content Repository (&lt;a href="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=170"&gt;JSR 170&lt;/a&gt;) provides a standard interface for a content repository to facilitate the integration and substitution of content management systems.  The &lt;a href="http://www.w3.org/2000/01/sw/"&gt;Semantic Web&lt;/a&gt; enabled by &lt;a href="http://www.w3.org/RDF/"&gt;RDF&lt;/a&gt; is enabling content applications to interact and share information with one another. Content syndication standards like RSS and Atom open new possibilities for content aggregation and reuse.  Metadata standards like the &lt;a href="http://dublincore.org/"&gt;Dublin Core&lt;/a&gt; help make content easier to find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is going to be very interesting to see how these standards evolve and realize their potential to create effective content management solutions.  I would expect rapid evolution of new content applications that streamline communication and discover new value for existing content.  &lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Jeff Potts explains the difference between Alfresco&amp;#39;s DM and AVM
Repositories</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Jeff Potts has written an excellent &lt;a href="http://ecmarchitect.com/archives/2009/08/31/1038"&gt;article explaining the functional differences between Alfresco's two different repositories&lt;/a&gt; (the original DM and the WCM).  The enclosed chart is a useful cheat sheet that belongs on any Alfresco developers cubicle.  Nice work Jeff!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those of you who are new to Alfresco, the WCM repository (or AVM: Advanced Versioning Model) was introduced to the platform when Alfresco added web content management.  The AVM is designed for managing structured XML content and does very cool things like snapshots and contributor "sandboxes."  But the AVM is slower than the original DM repository and has less powerful metadata capabilities.  Typically, web content will be managed as XML in the AVM and then pushed over to a cluster of DM repositories to power a dynamic website.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

The audience and most of the speakers came from the public radio and television community that is trying to deal with the disruptive force of new media.  I really enjoyed the opportunity to listen to new perspectives in content management.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Resource constrained, this industry has fallen behind in digital innovation and there was a great sense of urgency to adapt - or perish.  The different stations and shows were looking to work together, embrace risk, and pick up the pace.  Innovator in Video Journalism &lt;a href="http://www.rosenblumtv.com/"&gt;Mike Rosenblum&lt;/a&gt; gave a great talk about technology disruptions.  Using several examples, he made the point that "technology happens," someone figures out what to do with it, then market revolution happens.  &lt;a href="http://www.crv.com/CRVPartners/Tom_Mohr.html"&gt;Tom Mohr&lt;/a&gt; talked about the traditional print publishing industry's struggle to stay relevant and brought on some guests from the BBC and CBC to talk about their transformations. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My session on selecting a CMS, was a lot more grounded and tactical.  We talked about current state  and small steps to help get parity as cheaply as possible.  Many of public radio stations and shows are starting with something as simple as a static HTML site and a blog.  Some were growing out of this platform and moving to &lt;a href="http://drupal.org/"&gt;Drupal&lt;/a&gt; and various Nuke applicaitons&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, open source is very attractive for the price but many organizations have small to non-existent technical groups. This makes operating and installing any software (commercial and open source) a challenge.  One attendee that I spoke with made the point that public media needs a new generation of engineers that is as passionate about software as preceding generations was about audio/video engineering.   &lt;a href="http://www.publicinteractive.com/products.html"&gt;Public Interactive's&lt;/a&gt; SaaS product has a huge marketshare as does &lt;a href="http://www.pmachine.com/ee/"&gt;Expression Engine&lt;/a&gt; which is free for non-profits and non-commercial use.  However, I expect that these turnkey solutions could hold an organization back if it really wanted to turn the corner and become innovators.  You can't innovate without some level of investment and risk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was a lot of talk about collaboration between public media organizations.  This would share the cost of innovation so that the sector would innovate together without differentiation.  There is an initiative to share &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/"&gt;Google Analytics&lt;/a&gt; data.  There may be opportunities to standardize on data formats and even standardize on using the same technology.  On the open source side, my  co-panelist &lt;a href="http://www.radioopensource.org/author/brendan/"&gt;Brendan Greeley&lt;/a&gt; talked about the high degree of overlap between the open source community and the public media audience.,  He should know, he runs the web site of the popular radio show &lt;a href="http://www.radioopensource.org/"&gt;"Open Source."&lt;/a&gt;  He posts technical questions on the show's blog and listeners write back with answers.  Drupal has a module called &lt;a href="http://drupal.org/project/station"&gt;"Station"&lt;/a&gt; that provides tools for a radio station such as a schedule and a playlist.  &lt;a href="http://plone.org/"&gt;Plone&lt;/a&gt; has a number of add-on products to address issues like high bandwidth streaming and large file handling.  &lt;a href="http://www.joomla.org/"&gt;Joomla!&lt;/a&gt; has &lt;a href="http://extensions.joomla.org/component/option,com_mtree/task,viewlink/link_id,1412/Itemid,35/"&gt;Joomla Radio&lt;/a&gt;. I am sure there are others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I guess the big question is whether the public media companies have anything to offer this growing social media phenomenon.  Is &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; the new definition of "listener supported" programming?  Public Radio and Television have the advantage of trusted names and loyal audiences.  They just need to figure out a way to leverage these assets without allowing them to become encumbrances in a fluid and agile media world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>A Tale of Two Releases</title>
    <content type='html'>For the past month or so, there has been a lot of activity on the &lt;a href="http://lenya.apache.org/"&gt;Apache Lenya&lt;/a&gt; list about pulling the trigger on the much awaited 1.4 release.  For those of you who have not been following this project, 1.4 has been "just around the corner" for what seems like an eternity.  After bringing a few new of committers into the fold, it seemed like the project had the momentum to push 1.4 over the hump. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The project was obviously rusty on doing a major release.  The 1.2 series has been around since the middle of 2004 and the project was getting comfortable maintaining and incrementally improving it.  The &lt;a href="http://news.gmane.org/thread.php?group=gmane.comp.cms.lenya.devel"&gt;dev mailing list&lt;/a&gt; has some interesting discussion about code freezes and what to do when you find a blocker right before cutting a release candidate.   It is a thought provoking discussion if you are puzzling over the same issues.  In the dialog, &lt;a href="http://greg.abstrakt.ch/"&gt;Gregor Rothfuss&lt;/a&gt; sent out this very interesting link to Jonathan Corbet's article &lt;a href="http:///"&gt;A Tale of Two Release Cycles.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The article compares two projects:  The &lt;a href="http://www.kernel.org/"&gt;Linux Kernel&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/"&gt;GNU Emacs&lt;/a&gt; editor.  The Linux Kernel has a system of stable and experimental version numbers.  Evens (like 2.6.x) are stable, odds are experimental.  But the stable releases are not always so perfect right when they come out.  Linus's philosophy is that the longer you wait on a release, the more complex it gets.  It is better to just get it out, even if it has a couple known bugs.  Users of Linux know that the operating system is not without its bugs.  However, these bugs are usually are well documented and they are normally tolerable for even demanding, high availability applications.    People (techie sysadmins and power uses) who like Linux and keep their kernels current recognize these issues and plan for them.  More casual users of Linux go with highly managed distributions like &lt;a href="http://www.redhat.com/rhel/"&gt;Red Hat Enterprise Linux&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.novell.com/linux/"&gt;SUSE Enterprise&lt;/a&gt; that have their own release cycles that buffer their customers from the new releases. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emacs, conversely, has yet to do a major release since October 2001.  &lt;a href="http://www.stallman.org/"&gt;Richard Stallman&lt;/a&gt; has set the tone that software should not be released with known bugs (that is an exaggeration but you get the idea).  The Corbet's article is critical of Emac's long delays saying "It's not only users who get frustrated by long development cycles; the developers, too, find them tiresome. Projects which adopt shorter, time-based release cycles rarely seem to regret the change." &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I agree with the principle of "release early and often," much of depends on the context.  For example, Emacs was probably not hurt by a slow release cycle.  The Emacs users I know love the editor because it is familiar to them and they have built all of these macros and shortcuts to make the software their own.  New hardware and new computing demands probably make it more important to push a operating system kernel forward aggressively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To bring the topic to content management, a lot is going to depend on the user community.  Some business users are looking for stability first and features second.  Other users get excited by new versions of the system and are willing to report bugs and do work-arounds until they are addressed.  If you have users like this and can build a partnership where they want to work with you to push the software forward, great!  Ideally, the architecture is modular so the core of the application remains reliable and stable while new experimental features (that may be a little rough around the edges) are released.  You can look at Emacs this way.  The core application stays the same but users are constantly playing with their own new customizations. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most importantly, projects should adhere to a release schedule to prevent the build-up of unreleased features that will become a regression nightmare when the version is finally released.     Preview releases are also a good idea to keep the more daring/tolerant users of the software engaged.  This is the best time to get feedback on the new concepts you are exploring.  You don't want to know that a feature is useless after you got it "perfect."</content>

    <title>Apple, you might be losing me</title>
    <content type='html'>I am a huge Apple fan. I have a MacBook, an iPhone, and an iPad.  I love the aesthetic of Apple's hardware and the software. I update software religiously.  I don't mind paying the Apple premium because I believe in the superior quality.  I suffer at work for eschewing the corporate standard platform and using my own machine. I get goaded into arguments by &lt;a title="Deane Barker hates Apple" href="http://gadgetopia.com/"&gt;Apple haters&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Apple probably shouldn't have any reason to worry about losing me as a customer. Yet, I feel my own loyalty diminishing. Not because I lust after some other products; but because Apple has been doing many things to annoy me recently.  I regularly toy with the idea of leaving Apple for what I think are inferior products. That feels like a big deal to me. I know that I am just one insignificant customer and Apple is a huge and insanely profitable company. But if a customer like me is starting to lose his loyalty, perhaps Apple's dominating position may be at risk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here are the reasons why I could see myself jumping off the fanboy bandwagon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Patents&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple's litigious behavior is getting downright embarrassing. Instead of being great, it looks like Apple is trying to milk profit out of prior greatness.  Apple customers get so excited about what Apple is going to do next. How long can that enthusiasm last when Apple stops innovating?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Environment&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;They changed their decision after public outcry, but I question the values of a company that &lt;a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/07/07/apple-pulls-out-of-epeat-green-registration/"&gt;decides to pull out of EPEAT to save money when they are already wildly profitable.&lt;/a&gt; I also don't like how they make all of their products disposable by making the batteries non-replaceable.  The battery is always the first to go on any piece of well built mobile gadgetry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Authoritarianism&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple has been steadily closing their ecosystem. At first, we were told that it was for our own good. But now it is clear that the primary reason is competition and those moves are at our expense. For me, the biggest frustration is Apple's childish attacks on Google like pulling Maps and YouTube. The latest releases have been trying to get me to use Facebook and I hate Facebook. Apple makes it really hard for me to use the services that I like like Google+, ReadItLater/Pocket, etc. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;       &lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Low Wages&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know that Apple &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; get away with paying ridiculously low wages to Chinese factory workers and American retail associates, but that doesn't mean they should. Again, corporate values matter to me.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;       &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple is a brand company. They are able to charge a premium from the brand affinity they have built over the years. But their recent behavior is really pushing me away. My strategy now is to make this Mac last until a good enough alternative emerges.  Obviously Apple isn't worried. But maybe they should be.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>CM Field Guide: Social Coding for CMS Geeks</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;img class="alignleft" src="http://www.cmfieldguide.com/media/img/logo.png" alt="" width="200" height="172" style="padding: 0px 10px 10px 0px"/&gt;Evil genius Deane Barker (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/#!/gadgetopia"&gt;@gadgetopia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://gadgetopia.com/"&gt;gadgetopia.com&lt;/a&gt;) approached me with this idea at a vulnerable time. My fingers were itching to code. I had recently transitioned out of all programming responsibility for a consulting client. I was managing a few development projects on which I forbade myself from coding. I was also feeling a little disconnected from the content management community. With this backdrop, Deane taps into our strange shared hobby of detecting what content management system is running a website. He shows me some working Django code that he wrote (a little smelly but excellent for a first attempt at Python and Django — I love Deane's fearlessness.); and before I can force myself to say no, I am refactoring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That's how &lt;a href="https://github.com/sggottlieb/cmfieldguide"&gt;CM Field Guide&lt;/a&gt; got started. And it is shaping up to be a really cool project. While there are other applications that do the job of sniffing out what CMS a site is running on, CM Field Guide is unique in that it is a social coding project. We share the "tells" we know to look for and we invite people to submit theirs either as &lt;a href="https://github.com/sggottlieb/cmfieldguide/tree/master/cmfieldguide/cmsdetector/signatures"&gt;code&lt;/a&gt; or as a &lt;a href="https://github.com/sggottlieb/cmfieldguide/issues?direction=desc&amp;amp;sort=created&amp;amp;state=open"&gt;description that we can code&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/sggottlieb/cmfieldguide/wiki/BuildingASignature"&gt;The code that examines a website is called a "signature" and they are really easy to write&lt;/a&gt;. It's mostly metadata and a line or two of test logic. The foundation application and libraries do most of the work. We use &lt;a href="http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/"&gt;github's social coding model of forking and pull requests&lt;/a&gt;. As of this blog post, we have 26 platform signatures. Steven Brent (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/#!/stevenbrent"&gt;@stevenbrent&lt;/a&gt;) submitted 2 of them as github pull requests. Adriaan Bloem (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/#!/adriaanbloem"&gt;@adriaanbloem&lt;/a&gt;) and Robb Winkle (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/#!/robbwinkle"&gt;@robbwinkle&lt;/a&gt;) shared their secrets over email and github issues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While I am already finding the application useful, the most interesting aspect of the project for me is around knowledge management. The discipline of Knowledge Management likes to say that knowledge is distinguished from information because it is actionable. Turning information into executable code seems to take this to a whole new level. There is also a social aspect, it's fun to share this information with people and build relationships on a common interest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A closed alpha of the application is running at &lt;a href="http://www.cmfieldguide.org"&gt;www.cmfieldguide.com&lt;/a&gt;. We haven't done any real user interface work yet (volunteers?) and we haven't optimized the application for any kind of load. At the moment, we are only giving out accounts to friends and colleagues. But you can quickly become a friend with your contribution!</content>

We focus on one aspect of digital marketing but neglecting another critical step eliminates our impact. To be successful, you have to be good at lots of things and pay attention to the details. It is better to be proficient in all of the dimensions of digital marketing than to be excellent in any one. So much for the hope that you are just "one viral video" away from achieving your most ambitious marketing goals. Welcome to the grind.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Discover Magazine on Plone case study</title>
    <content type='html'>The &lt;a href="http://plone.net"&gt;Plone.net site&lt;/a&gt; has a very good case study on &lt;a href="http://plone.net/case-studies/discover-magazine"&gt;Discover Magazine's migration to Plone&lt;/a&gt;.  The &lt;a href="http://discovermagazine.com/"&gt;Discover Magazine site&lt;/a&gt; looks like a model magazine site: clean, careful presentation; lots of imagery and multi-media; registration only content; and synergy with the print edition.  The article covers how &lt;a href="http://plone.org"&gt;Plone&lt;/a&gt; is used to manage content, user adoption, performance, integration with 3rd party applications, and content migration.  It's a very worthy read if you are considering Plone for your news or magazine site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am also encouraged to see that the &lt;a href="https://plone.net"&gt;Plone.net&lt;/a&gt; site (which is targeted to business users) is filling up with content.  There are &lt;a href="http://plone.net/case-studies"&gt;34 case studies&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://plone.net/sites"&gt;Plone sites directory&lt;/a&gt; contains 1,442 entries.  I know that this was a key strategy to achieve the goal of increasing awareness about Plone and it is impressive to see the progress they have made.</content>

    <title>There is no folder</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I had &lt;a href="http://theploneblog.org/blog/archive/2006/03/18/there-is-no-folder"&gt;this blog post by&lt;/a&gt; Jonah Bossewitch bookmarked for quite some time and I figure I should mention it not only for it's brilliant &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133093/"&gt;Matrix&lt;/a&gt; reference ("Do not try to bend the folder -- that's impossible. Instead, only try to realize the truth. Then you will see that it is not the folder that bends--it is only yourself."), but its mind bending implications for content management.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most web content management systems, see content as something that can be organized into hierarchical structures.  Web sites are frequently represented by sitemaps and navigation which presume everything has a place in a tree.  I say this is a vestige of a static web world where the web server merely served up what was on a file system (which is a hierarchical organization of folders and files).  If the web were to be organized that way, it would stink.  Luckily it isn't.  The web is a collection of interconnected nodes.  Search engines flatten out the web into topic based lists based on the occurance of words and &lt;a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=GOOG"&gt;billion dollar algorithms.&lt;/a&gt;  Interestingly &lt;a href="http://desktop.google.com/?promo=mp-gds-v1-1"&gt;Google Desktop&lt;/a&gt; evokes a devotion similar  to &lt;a href="http://www.tivo.com/0.0.asp"&gt;TiVo&lt;/a&gt; for making a mess of poorly organized content (television is organized by time) accessible and useful.  So, it isn't even that we don't understand other people's hierarchical organizational structure, we can't even find things that we file away in our own, custom designed filing system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest trends in tagging and social bookmarking are just other, more intentional, ways to create lists of content on a topic area.   &lt;a href="http://http://flickr.com"&gt;Flickr&lt;/a&gt;'s  &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_cloud"&gt;Tag Cloud&lt;/a&gt; is an example of structureless dynamic navigation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what open source content management systems are the best for supporting this more &lt;i&gt;evolved&lt;/i&gt; view of websites?  I would agree with Jonah that &lt;a href="http://drupal.org"&gt;Drupal&lt;/a&gt; is the most oriented toward tagging.  Drupal has no folders, just vocabularies and topics.  It makes sense that Drupal would be first to execute this new vision because it is designed to enable a community to post and discuss ideas and news which don't necessarily belong in a single place within an informational tree.  Blog software such as &lt;a href="http://wordpress.org/"&gt;Wordpress&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="rollerweblogger.org"&gt;Roller&lt;/a&gt; deliver this functionality through categories.  Sadly, &lt;a href="www.blogger.com"&gt;Blogger&lt;/a&gt; does not have categories.  Perhaps this is over-confidence in the Google search algorithm?   Granted, your average not-so-technical knowledge worker may have a hard time breaking out of the desktop metaphor of putting things in representations of physical "places."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jonah also points out how &lt;a href="http://plone.org"&gt;Plone&lt;/a&gt;, which is built on the folder based &lt;a href="http://zope.org"&gt;Zope&lt;/a&gt;, has Smart Folders which are really saved searches.  This allows you to create dynamic topic based lists without entering the same search criteria every time.  I am waiting to see a Plone site whose navigation is all Smart Folders.   Incidentally, Smart Folders and &lt;a href="http://plone.org/products/plone/roadmap/128"&gt;ATCTSyndication&lt;/a&gt; is a powerful combination that will allow you to create a RSS feed on any search. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While &lt;a href="http://ez.no"&gt;eZ publish&lt;/a&gt; is very folder based, it has a nice separation between "object" and "location" that allows an object to exist in more than one locations.  Content assets within &lt;a href="http://www.cps-project.org"&gt;CPS&lt;/a&gt; exist in a placeless repository and are accessible through the site hierarchy through "proxies."  This also allows a piece of content to exist in multiple places at once. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you enjoy this topic you should take the time to read Clay Shirky's long but very good blog post &lt;a href="http://shirky.com/writings/ontology_overrated.html"&gt;Ontology is Overrated: Categories, Links, and Tags&lt;/a&gt;, which inspired Jonah's post.  Clay makes some great observations about how &lt;a href="http://www.yahoo.com"&gt;Yahoo!s&lt;/a&gt; elitist, top down organization of the web ("We understand better than you how the world is organized, because we are trained professionals") is inferior to Google's view that "There is no shelf. There is no file system. The links alone are enough."  I would add that &lt;a href="http://dmoz.org/"&gt;dmoz&lt;/a&gt; is even more deluded thinking that a web site only belongs in one node of their hierarchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It looks like tagging is trumping hierarchies and taxonomy on the big Web.  I would be very interested in hearing how these concepts are playing inside of the corporate firewall.  If you have a story to tell, please comment here or send me an email.  The average corporate intranet is definitely failing to deliver on the promise of being "institutional knowledge at your fingertips." Will tagging and search be the paradigm that saves it?&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>More Granular Terms for SEO</title>
    <content type='html'>Search Engine Optimization is one of the primary services we offer at &lt;a href="http://www.globalmarketingops.com/"&gt;Lionbridge Global Marketing Operations&lt;/a&gt;. Localization is more than just translation, it is adapting the content to be more effective in local markets; and local SEO is a big part of that. When talking with customers about SEO, I find that I need better language to describe what is involved. The term "SEO" is so vague and (at least with me) carries so many negative connotations. I have taken to use the following terms. You might find them helpful too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Search Engine Compatibility&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Search engine compatibility is making your site easy for search engines to crawl through and parse. Think of a search engine crawler as an honored guest to your site. You don't want to piss it off by being a bad host with issues like broken links, slow page load times, site outages, broken HTML, flash-based navigation, text in images, unstable urls, a poorly configured robots.txt… Googlebot is a busy little guy with a big web to crawl. Make his life easier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I also put title tags and meta description in this category of search engine compatibility because when the search engine tries to display your page in its results, it wants to show a title and description. If those don't exist, then the search engine just has to make it up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are great tools like &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/home?hl=en"&gt;Google Web Master Tools&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.brightedge.com/"&gt;BrightEdge&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://sitebeam.net/"&gt;SiteBeam&lt;/a&gt; to help you with search engine compatibility. Use them!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Keyword Standardization&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you want a page to rank highly on a search result, you need to use language that people are likely to search for. Theresa Regli (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TheresaRegli"&gt;@TheresaRegli&lt;/a&gt;) has a great story from her taxonomy work at &lt;a href="http://www.yankeecandle.com/"&gt;Yankee Candle&lt;/a&gt;. Apparently, internally Yankee Candle calls those jar candles "Housewarmers;" but the rest of the world calls them "jar candles." Nobody but an employee (or the most loyal customer) would search for a "housewarmer." It looks like Yankee followed Theresa's advice and both terms are used on the site. I think that it is a good idea to have both because some people will see a candle (which is labeled housewarmer) and type housewarmer into a search to buy one.  If you are Yankee Candle, you want your housewarmer/jar candle category landing page to be the top result.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All this keyword standardization sounds obvious. Of course you want to communicate with words that your audience thinks in.  It is a little less obvious when you are dealing with a global site because you need to know what terms people in different markets are going to search for.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Search Engine Exploitation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Search Engine Exploitation encompasses the dark art of trying to understand how the search algorithms work and then gaming them to your advantage. We don't do this and don't recommend that you do it either. Any advantage you gain will be short-lived and possibly followed by penalties. It is much better to develop good content that a reader would like and work &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; the search engines to connect their users with it. That makes it a win-win. You should stay away from SEO experts that brag about their intimate knowledge of how the algorithms work and their ability to trick them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More precise language is always better when communicating. Hopefully, these terms will help you have more productive conversations about increasing traffic from search engines. Start with search engine compatibility and look for the worst offenses. If your site goes down all of the time, fix that as soon as possible. Outages hurt more than SEO. Then verify that the robots can walk through your site. I have had a couple of clients with a robots.txt that denied all access to the site. In both cases, those directives were put in place before the site was launched and never removed. Good navigation also critical. Every page you want indexed needs to be navigable (linked to from somewhere). Once you have made your site accessible to the crawler, then focus on keyword standardization to tune how you communicate with how your audience thinks. This may change over time as you adjust your strategy and also as language evolves so you need to keep on top of that.</content>

    <title>Is it open source? Does it matter?</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;div class="thumbnail"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skitch.com/sggottlieb/by8q3/picture-4.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.skitch.com/20090105-8m2nc8xu9hcdbk5jmsh8bp9b71.preview.jpg" alt="Picture 4.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Lucida Grande, Trebuchet, sans-serif, Helvetica, Arial; font-size: 10px; color: #808080"&gt;Uploaded with &lt;a href="http://plasq.com/"&gt;plasq&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="http://skitch.com"&gt;Skitch&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As potential customers start to evaluate open source software in the hopes of reducing costs, some are surprised to find the savings is not what they expected.  This is not a "free puppy" scenario where the software is so "needy" that it costs you more to maintain it.  Rather, this is a case of the products that commercial buyers are most likely to recognize and consider, &lt;em&gt;operate and behave like commercial software companies&lt;/em&gt;.  These high profile open source vendors are typically established with a substantial venture capital investment and have obligations to grow revenue quickly.  They are building infrastructure (sales and marketing organizations, documentation, customer support) to compete with commercial products.  They are careful about protecting their intellectual property.  They pay salaries to people who don't code.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The screen shot above shows part of the &lt;a href="http://www.alfresco.com"&gt;Alfresco&lt;/a&gt; registration screen that you need to fill out to get access to a trial download and various information about the product.  Because they collect this information, they probably have the sales and marketing staff to contact the people who register.  Not all commercial open source companies operate in this way.  Many just put their stuff out there with the hopes that potential customers qualify themselves and come forward if they have a need that a business relationship (support, custom development, training, implementation resources, etc.) that the vendor can satisfy.  Open source software companies are spread across a spectrum ranging from the classic commercial software model to something that more closely resembles community open source.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is not surprising that commercial open source companies that behave like traditional software companies need to monetize their customers like traditional commercial software companies do.  In many cases, these companies depend on &lt;em&gt;selling commercially licensed versions of their software products&lt;/em&gt;.  These products can be cheaper than their commercial competitors but they don't have to be.  In theory, the open source development model saves money by reusing free, externally developed components rather than building everything yourself.  But this strategy is not exclusive to open source software vendors.  Just look at the number of closed source web content management companies that use the &lt;a href="http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/"&gt;TinyMCE WYSIWYG&lt;/a&gt; editor or the &lt;a href="http://velocity.apache.org/"&gt;Velocity template engine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I have written blog posts (&lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2006/08/commercial-open-source-business.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2007/01/commercial-open-source.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/products-page"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; describing the different twists on open source business models.  These concepts are important to understand because they frame your role as a prospect and customer.  The most common strategy is to &lt;em&gt;sell&lt;/em&gt; a commercially licensed "Enterprise Edition" that you need to pay an annual subscription fee to use.  The absence of an up front license cost is nice but, like with SaaS, the annual fees can add up.  It is up to the vendor to decide what happens if you stop paying for the subscription.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Offering a free, open source licensed version of the software is what qualifies the vendor as an "open source software company."  But, depending on the company, this product (often called Community Edition), may either range from window dressing to a core part of their strategy.  Some open source companies generate revenue by using their community edition to penetrate the market and create opportunities for other services such as training, support, or up-sell.  Other companies actively discourage the use of their community edition products.  How viable the community edition is for your business depends on both your requirements and how the software vendor treats the product.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a software product has a commercial license or is otherwise identical to traditional commercial software, it doesn't really matter that it is marketed as open source; it is commercial software.  By extension, if a software vendor only really supports the commercial version of its product, it is a commercial software vendor regardless of how it markets itself.  The industry is confusing this way because it classifies software not by the license of the software itself but by the claimed business model of the vendor.  I have to admit that I am as guilty of this as the next guy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you have been looking for a traditionally licensed (closed-source) software product (with all of the benefits and costs that normally go along with a software purchase), why not consider the commercially licensed products from open source vendors?  There is no reason why the services supporting the product would not be comparable to a similarly priced traditional commercial software product.  From a sales support perspective, you can expect an experience that is comparable with a low-to-medium price ($30,000-$70,000) commercial application.  You won't get any Super Bowl tickets but you will get the attention of a sales engineer to help show you the benefits of the platform - at least over &lt;a href="http://www.webex.com/"&gt;WebEx&lt;/a&gt;, in person if they are local or the deal is big enough.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you are looking for an open source product that you can save money by self-supporting (with the help of a community), there may be some commercial open source products worth considering.  Be aware of the positioning of the open source community edition. In some cases the community edition is intentionally unstable and unsupported but, in many cases, the community edition is production quality software that benefits from the investment in its commercial brother.  Just don't expect a commercial software sales experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.magnolia-cms.com/home.html"&gt;Magnolia&lt;/a&gt; has a nice program for helping prospective customers evaluate their software.  They have a commercially (visible source) licensed Enterprise Edition (EE) and a GPL licensed Community Edition (CE).  Because CE is on the same code line and is tested the same as the more feature-rich EE, it is a legitimate option for real websites.  Under Magnolia's evaluation agreement, Magnolia staff will perform the role of a software sales organization by doing demonstrations and answering questions.  In return the prospective customer agrees that, if they choose Magnolia, they purchase EE. This saves Magnolia the potential risk of investing a sale and having the customer turn around and go with the free version.  Potential customers that are looking for a commercial software sales experience get one and are sold a commercial product.  Customers who want to invest their time and explore the different options get supported through open source avenues (mailing lists, issue tracker, etc.).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Being branded and marketed as "open source" doesn't make software inexpensive or good or bad.  Open source business models simply create opportunities to unbundle the various aspects of a solution and package them in different ways.  &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2007/01/commercial-open-source.html"&gt;Open source vendors are experimenting with ways to package and charge for their solutions&lt;/a&gt;.  Some companies are generating revenue from their free products, others are basing their businesses solely on their commercial products.  These nuances may seem confusing to someone who is accustomed to simple comparisons of features and price in an otherwise homogenous marketplace.  However, an understanding of these options is becoming increasing important to today's software buyer.</content>

    <title>J.Boye Conference for Web and Intranet Professionals</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago I had the pleasure of participating in a J.Boye expert group in New York.  I love the open and honest format of the J.Boye events and am looking forward to the &lt;a href="http://jboye.com/conferences/philadelphia11/"&gt;J.Boye conference this May (3-5)&lt;/a&gt;.  I am presenting on content management assessment (&lt;a href="http://jboye.com/conferences/philadelphia11/program/speakers/seth-gottlieb/#presentation1"&gt;Grading Your CMS Implentation&lt;/a&gt;) in the web content management track.  That track will also have a talk on HTML5 and case studies from The Nature Conservancy, The Smithsonian Institution, and University of Houston Libraries. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think this is going to be a great track for organizations that have laid down the first parts of the foundation and are looking to take their websites to the next level.  Hopefully I will see you there.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>My website may be ugly but....</title>
    <content type='html'>Here is a &lt;a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20070927/wr_nm/media_mistakes_dc_3"&gt;very good article about website design for utility over beauty&lt;/a&gt;.  To quote:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;After all, this is a media company whose magazines, books, products and programs feature ideas about attractive and tasteful lifestyles. Why not a beautiful Web site?  "That was a big mistake," Wenda Harris Millard, the company's president of media, said this week during a panel discussion at Advertising Week. "We put beauty before utility."  She said the front page, with its video player and jazzy graphics, included only about five links to actual content, "so the things people were looking for couldn't be found."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the many Web 2.0 trends is the rise of information over form.  Back in the early days of the web, I remember people trying to duplicate a paper experience on the screen.  Then, websites became video games challenging users to explore to find what they needed.  Now it is all about the information and getting to it as quickly as possible.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And THAT is why the left navigation on my website gets pushed down to the bottom of the page on earlier versions of Internet Explorer.  :)</content>

    <title>How I use Twitter for Work</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;div style="float: right; margin-left: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sggottlieb/4358784709/" title="photo sharing"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2771/4358784709_0445cbe33a_m.jpg" alt="" style="border: solid 2px #000000;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 0.9em; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sggottlieb/4358784709/"&gt;Publishing Decision Tree V2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Originally uploaded by &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/people/sggottlieb/"&gt;sggottlieb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;I just read &lt;a href="http://contentedmanagement.net/blog/i-know-why-the-caged-bird-sings/"&gt;Philippe Parker's thoughtful response&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="http://www.jboye.com/blogpost/how-i-use-twitter-for-work/"&gt;Janus Boye's provocative post "How I use Twitter for Work".&lt;/a&gt;  Both these articles, plus my recent experience at &lt;a href="http://podcamp.pbworks.com/PodCampWesternMass"&gt;PodCamp Western Mass&lt;/a&gt;, made me a little more conscious of my strategy and techniques for social media.  As you can see from this &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sggottlieb/4358784709/"&gt;geeky flow chart&lt;/a&gt;, I have put some thought into what I publish where.  But I had thought less about who to follow.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My official Twitter policy was to &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2009/02/my-social-network-friend-policy.html"&gt;only follow people that "inform and/or entertain me."&lt;/a&gt; Because I use Twitter mainly for work, my bias certainly leans toward the "inform" side.  Although, I do appreciate a good snark once in while, I have un-followed people who fill the timeline with mostly personal stuff.  If I found myself automatically skipping over someone's tweets because I was expecting something mundane, I un-followed him/her.  If a Facebook friend re-published their Twitter stream into Facebook, I un-followed him/her on Twitter.  These tactics kept my following count to a manageable number of 150.  When I say manageable, I mean I am not overwhelmed by the volume of updates but I don't go back and read every tweet when I am away from Twitter for an extended period of time.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At PodCamp, I finally learned the value of lists.  By using private lists for work, friends, fun, and news, I can follow more people but handle the traffic differently.  When I am really busy, I just track my work list and my @replies.  I glance at my friends and fun lists when I have more time but I never go back more than a few hours in the timeline.  My news list takes the place of personal portals for the day's highlights.  Since sorting this stuff out, my following count has grown to 164 with no real impact on time consumption.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biggest change is in how I use RSS.  With my new Twitter strategy, I check my reader less frequently and am able to skip over posts that I already found on Twitter.  At this point, Twitter brings me timely (either because it is news or because everyone is talking about it) posts quicker.  The un-tweeted RSS entries are still important to me for general learning and background knowledge.  I expect that, over time, people will promote everything they write on Twitter.  This has already happened with sites like &lt;a href="http://www.cmswire.com"&gt;CMSWire&lt;/a&gt;. Now &lt;a href="http://feedburner.google.com"&gt;FeedBurner&lt;/a&gt; gives you the option to automatically tweet every entry in your RSS feed.  When a Twitter feed becomes identical to the RSS feed, I tend to un-follow/unsubscribe to one depending on how timely the information tends to be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This system is working well for me now but I am sure that it will continue to change as the medium evolves.  I am interested in learning other people's techniques.  The tag #howiusetwitter seems appropriate and free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br clear="all" /&gt;</content>

    <title>Tale of two developers</title>
    <content type='html'>Angie Byron, has wonderful post on &lt;a href="http://webchick.net/embrace-the-chaos"&gt;approaches to contributing to an open source project&lt;/a&gt;.  She makes her point in parallel stories of an outgoing developer who puts a lot of intermediate versions of her code for public review and a perfectionist who holds back code that is not finished.  Through the narratives, Angie shows how submitting lots of code helps leverage the collective knowledge of the community to learn better programming skills.  Submitting code and interacting with the community also helps a developer build relationships with other developers who will be more likely to help her out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With all of the focus on cost savings and intellectual property, the educational aspect of open source software is frequently overlooked - at least by business decision makers who have no idea how poorly written their in-house developed code is.  Open source software has advantages over in-house software that extend beyond simply having more programmers eyes on the code; the ability to interact with similarly inspired developers across corporate boundaries can be a huge benefit that translates into professional development and job satisfaction.  Of course, this value does not come for free.  Like any other activity that builds skills, working on open source takes time. A manager should consider the educational aspects of open source software when developing a professional development program for his/her technology team.  If you think of the time and expense of going to a traditional conference where a developer will, at best sit passively through conference sessions, working collaboratively on a real project either remotely or with developers at a sprint.  This does not have to be limited to open source software but the open source licensing model certainly helps.  There are some commercial products with active developer communities modeled after open source communities that share code and interact.  If you have a large in-house development team, consider practices like pair programming, commit mailing lists, and code reviews that help turn programming into more of an open, collaborative effort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://webchick.net/embrace-the-chaos"&gt;A tale of two developers&lt;/a&gt; belongs on my "all time" open source reading list.  Thanks Angie!</content>

    <title>Open source manages the Internet</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://asay.blogspot.com"&gt;Matt Asay&lt;/a&gt; just posted this &lt;a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/openresource/archives/2006/09/open_source_man_1.html"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;  based on a &lt;a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/report2006/"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="http://www.sitepoint.com"&gt;SitePoint&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.ektron.com"&gt;Ektron&lt;/a&gt; (thanks Martin BÃ¤hr for the heads up) about how open source software is starting to become the dominant way to manage content on the Internet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A huge swath of the web is managed by open source, with the vast majority of the remainder well-positioned to be consumed by open source.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: this is &lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;"managed"&lt;/span&gt; not &lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;"served."&lt;/span&gt;  The web server war was already one by the Apache web server.  I think these statistics say a couple of things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Open source content management software is out there and performing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The demographics of the web are changing.  Call it Web 2.0. Call it the long tail.  Lots of individuals and small organizations are publishing like crazy and the tools they are choosing are open source.  Small groups in large organizations are doing the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</content>

    <title>Bricolage Launches Bricolage Wiki</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.bricoloage.cc"&gt;Bricolage project&lt;/a&gt; recently announced the launch of their community &lt;a href="http://wiki.bricolage.cc"&gt;Wiki&lt;/a&gt;.  The presence of the Wiki will help spread the load of managing user and technical documentation for Bricolage.  Currently, documentation is pretty thin and difficult to navigate so the mail list is the primary source of information on using and developing in Bricolage.  If the community embraces the Wiki, it could be a very valuable resource.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right now, there is no content on the Wiki so the best bets for Bricolage documentation are the &lt;a href="http://www.bricolage.cc/docs/howtos/"&gt;How To Guides&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="http://www.bricolage.cc/docs/current/api/"&gt;API Docs&lt;/a&gt; (which also have some user docs sprinkled in), this &lt;a href="http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2004/08/27/bricolage.html"&gt;overview article&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="http://www.perl.org"&gt;Perl.org&lt;/a&gt;, and, of course, the &lt;a href="http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=bricolage-general"&gt;mail archives.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you use Bricolage and are looking for a way to contribute, helping populate the Wiki would be a great way to get started.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

I am particularly happy with the content lifecycle diagram that we developed and &lt;a href="http://www.sethgregorydesign.com/"&gt;Seth Gregory&lt;/a&gt; designed.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sggottlieb/8029565032/" title="Content Lifecycle by sggottlieb, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8311/8029565032_691babdb7a.jpg" width="500" height="327" alt="Content Lifecycle"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What I like about the diagram is that it is simple.  &lt;a href="http://www.cmsconsultants.org/resources/poster/"&gt;Other content lifecycle diagrams&lt;/a&gt; show a lot of detail that tends to overwhelm in non-academic settings.  The key points that this diagram highlights are that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Marketing operations should be an iterative process that uses results to guide continual improvement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The lifecycle operates within the context of your overall content marketing strategy (who you want to reach and how) and governance (your constraints like style guide, budget, regulation compliance).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Publishing is more than just saving content in your CMS.  &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2012/09/the-three-qualities-of-effective-publishing-findable-usable-and-actionable.html"&gt;There is a very important "promotion" element to make content findable, usable and actionable&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The white paper digs into those three themes and discusses the types of roles and skills that are necessary to be successful.  &lt;a href="http://info.lionbridge.com/Marketing_Operations_Whitepaper.html?utm_name=marketingoperationsebook&amp;utm_source=contenthere&amp;utm_medium=blog"&gt;Go ahead and download it&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>Two articles on the State of OS CMS</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;There are two recent articles on the state of OS CMS:  "The State of Open Source CMS" by Gregor Rothfuss in the &lt;a href="http://www.cutter.com/itjournal"&gt;Cutter IT Journal&lt;/a&gt; which you need to subscribe to read; and "Straight from the Source: Open Source Content Management" by John Harney in inaugural issue of &lt;a href="http://mag1.olivesoftware.com/am/welcome/OSJ/OSJ-2005-07.asp"&gt;Enterprise Open Source Journal&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Writing on this topic is a daunting task because the space is so expansive and dynamic.  These authors have both done an excellent job of introducing the "market" and describing some of the trends that are happening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregor Rothfuss is very qualified to write on this topic.  Not only is he a committer on the Apache Lenya project, but he is also an officer of &lt;a href="http://www.oscom.org"&gt;OSCOM&lt;/a&gt; - the organization of open source CMS projects.  One of Gregor's more interesting points is that the OSCMS space is overcoming a history of fragmentation with no clear market leader.  One of the developments that may change this is the Java Content Repository (&lt;a href="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=170"&gt;JSR 170&lt;/a&gt;) which will lower switching costs and allow different CMS to become more interoperable.  Open source CMS projects are outpacing their proprietary counterparts in adopting the JCR partly because vendor lock-in is not on their agenda.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Harney's article is a good introduction to content management and open source.  In it, John discusses base content management features that are supported by open source CMS and the advantages and disadvantages of adopting an open source solution.  There is particular attention paid to Zope with mentions of OpenCMS, Mambo, TYPO3 and WebGUI. &lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Internet Explorer Support</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I tend to be more aggressive than most when it comes to ending support for outdated browsers.  As I mentioned in &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2010/04/supporting-internet-explorer-6.html"&gt;this article about ending IE6 support 5 years ago&lt;/a&gt;, supporting old browsers is not worth additional cost and drag on innovation.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am happy whenever I see a big web property end support for an old browser, but I was absolutely thrilled to see that starting on &lt;a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/gp/microsoft-internet-explorer"&gt;January 12th 2016, Microsoft will only support the most current version of Internet Explorer available for their supported operating systems&lt;/a&gt;.  This means:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;IE8 and lower will be practically dead. It will only be supported on some embedded versions of Windows.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;IE9 will only be supported on Windows Vista (remember Vista?), which will lose support on April 11, 2017.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;IE10 will only be supported on older versions of Windows Server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even better, whenever Microsoft launches a new version of Internet Explorer, the older versions immediately lose support on mainstream desktops (and probably phones and tablets too).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks Microsoft!  It is a lot easier to stop supporting a browser if the software vendor behind it has also abandoned it.&lt;/p&gt;  </content>

    <title>CMIS in brief</title>
    <content type='html'>CMSWire has a &lt;a href="http://www.cmswire.com/cms/enterprise-cms/dehyping-cmis-003329.php"&gt;nice article briefly explaining CMIS&lt;/a&gt;. At this stage of the standards process, this level of understanding of CMIS is probably sufficient for most - especially if you are working in web content management.</content>

    <title>NYC Agile Developer Book Club</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;img src="http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/c/5/1/global_7960017.jpeg" style="float:right; margin:0px 0px 10px 10px"/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;My friend and colleague &lt;a href="http://blog.spilth.org/"&gt;Brian Kelly&lt;/a&gt; and I are starting an &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/NYC-Agile-Developer-Book-Club/"&gt;Agile Developer Book Club&lt;/a&gt; in New York.  The first meeting will be on April 29th (location TBD) and we will start by reading one of my favorite books on software development: &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/020161622X?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=contenthere-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=020161622X"&gt;The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=contenthere-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=020161622X" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /&gt;. After that, we will move onto other books in that genre.  The general idea is to assemble a cross-language group of developers that want to improve their craft by learning from great books and each other.  Each meeting we will discuss a section of the book.  Beyond that, it is up to the group to figure out the details.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you live or work in New York City and want to hang out with some people who also want to be great programmers, please join the &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/NYC-Agile-Developer-Book-Club/"&gt;Meetup group&lt;/a&gt; and block April 29th on your calendar.  If you are not in New York, you should still read The Pragmatic Programmer and talk about it to whoever will listen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note: in case you were wondering, I have not relocated to New York.  I still live in &lt;a href="http://www.northamptonma.gov/aboutNorthampton/"&gt;the heart of the beautiful Pioneer Valley&lt;/a&gt; but spend a lot of time working in New York.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Predicting FOSS Fail</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theopensourceway.org/wiki/Main_Page"&gt;The Open Source Way&lt;/a&gt; is a great resource for developers who want to start their own open source project.  It is a wiki of lessons learned and best practices gathered primarily from experiences working on the RedHat and Fedora projects.  One page that I find particularly interesting is "&lt;a href="https://www.theopensourceway.org/wiki/How_to_tell_if_a_FLOSS_project_is_doomed_to_FAIL"&gt;How to tell if a FLOSS project is doomed to FAIL&lt;/a&gt;."  The format assigns "fail points" for common (and uncommonly stupid) mistakes that project leads make.  Making a few of these mistakes doesn't doom your project but making lots of them definitely stacks the odds against you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it was written from the perspective of a Linux library developer, the list also contains useful information for other types of open source projects.  I was hoping to add some content around project leadership but I was discouraged to see that I was not able to create an account or contribute to the discussion page (FAIL!).  Here is what I would have added:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is no road map showing planned improvements to the software&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The project leader(s) is(/are) not transparent about decisions [ +5 points of fail ]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are no guidelines for contributing to the project [ +20 points of fail ]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The project does not have a way to attract and incorporate new contributors [ +10 points of fail ]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The project does not have a system for recognizing/rewarding contributions [ +5 points of fail ]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</content>

    <title>US pays to make open source safer</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has &lt;a href="http://www.vnunet.com/itweek/news/2148598/pays-open-source-safer"&gt;recently pledged&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;one million dollars&lt;/i&gt; (read in a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Evil"&gt;Dr. Evil&lt;/a&gt; voice) to fix security bugs in open source projects like Linux, Apache and Mozilla.  &lt;a href="http://www.stanford.edu/"&gt;Stanford University&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.symantec.com/index.htm"&gt;Symantec&lt;/a&gt; are going to do the work.  On the one hand, I think that is a nice (but token) gesture of support for open source as a national (dare I say planetary?) asset.  On the other hand,  from a security standpoint, I would say that open source already has a distinct advantage over proprietary software because there are more people looking at the code and its flaws ("&lt;a href="http://www.firstmonday.org/issues/issue3_3/raymond/"&gt;Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow&lt;/a&gt;").  For example, I would not vote on an electronic voting system whose source code was not exposed to public scrutiny.  So why single open source software out?  I wonder what the government can do to make proprietary software more reliable and secure because, if you look at the security alerts, that is where the majority of problems seem to be.  on the other hand, I am not sure that I want the government to have any influence over code that I cannot see in light of the &lt;a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story.asp?guid=%7B52569B52%2D80C7%2D4F4F%2D974E%2DFD7EF4CC7284%7D&amp;siteid=yhoo"&gt;recent trends regarding privacy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Dries and the Entrepreneurial Bug</title>
    <content type='html'>Dries Buytaert has an &lt;a href="http://buytaert.net/mollom-my-content-monitoring-startup"&gt;announcement on his blog for another startup&lt;/a&gt; that he is working on called &lt;a href="http://mollom.com/"&gt;Mollom&lt;/a&gt;.  Mollom is a content monitoring service that is optimized for user generated content.  Beyond tracking and blocking comment spam, Mollom's goal is to rate the quality of content.  Mollom is now in public beta and free (as in beer).  Once out of beta, there will be a free simple version and a for-pay premium version.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The technology works as a web service (&lt;a href="http://mollom.com/how-mollom-works"&gt;details here&lt;/a&gt;).  When a comment or user generated post is submitted, your website sends it to Mollom.  Mollum will assess if it is likely to be spam.  If it is, Mollum sends back a CAPTCHA for the submitter to fill out.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The service requires you to install a plugin into your CMS.  Drupal users can take advantage of a pre-built module.  There is also a Java library that can be integrated into Java CMS.  Everyone else must build their own plugin on top of the &lt;a href="http://mollom.com/api"&gt;Mollom Open API&lt;/a&gt;.  Hopefully, other CMS vendors and users of their platforms will build plugins and submit them to Mollom for distribution.  If Mollom takes off, a &lt;a href="http://wordpress.com/"&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt; plugin can't be too far away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not try to dig too much into the dynamics between Mollom and &lt;a href="http://www.acquia.com"&gt;Acquia&lt;/a&gt;.  Dries explains that Acquia is his day job while Mollom is his spare-time, unfunded startup.  In his blog post, Dries mentions that Acquia will offer Mollom as part of their &lt;a href="http://acquia.com/projects/wiki/caliper"&gt;Caliper project&lt;/a&gt;.  I wouldn't say that Dries is doing this because he is bored.  He started the initiative with fellow student &lt;a href="http://schrauwen.info/benjamin/"&gt;Benjamin Schrauwen&lt;/a&gt;  before the Acquia opportunity came along.  When he negotiated the Acquia job, he probably got permission to work on this.  As an Acquia investor, I would be a little concerned about Dries' commitment to their start-up.  But, given Dries' value to any Drupal-based business, I am sure that the VC's are willing to give him wide latitude.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content>

    <content type='html'>On October 18th, Bryant Shea from &lt;a href="http://www.molecular.com"&gt;Molecular&lt;/a&gt; and I will be presenting at &lt;a href="http://www.doctrain.com/east"&gt;DocTrain East&lt;/a&gt; in Lowell, MA.   The topic of our talk is "New Documentation Strategies For A Web 2.0 World."  Here is our descriptive blurb:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The web is changing the way people consume information and creating new opportunities for documentation and other product content to reach out beyond the manual and engage users. The web is also giving voice to others who have something to say about your products. To navigate these new dynamics we must change our mindset about what documentation is, our relationship with our audience, and our control over the information. This session will introduce technologies for reaching and conversing with the your audience to create knowledgeable and passionate users. We will cover blogs, podcasts, annotations, and wiki technologies and how to turn a vocal community into an ally rather than threat. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just got off the phone with Bryant and we were pretty excited about how Web 2.0 trends and concepts are transforming the world of technical writing and communication.  Come and join us to learn more.</content>

    <title>The Dead Zone of Software Pricing</title>
    <content type='html'>A couple of weeks ago I subscribed to the &lt;a href="http://groups.google.com/group/lean-startup-circle"&gt;Lean Startup Circle&lt;/a&gt; mailing list and I have been thoroughly enjoying the conversation ever since.  If you have any entrepreneurial sensibilities lurking inside you, I highly recommend that you subscribe.  The list participants have been in the trenches building companies and are happy to share what they have learned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recently, a thread on pricing caught my eye.  This doesn't have to be strictly software licensing fees.  It could be subscriptions or services too.  &lt;a href="http://groups.google.com/groups/profile?hl=en&amp;amp;enc_user=-6N0WRQAAACB1gjlgtmGqxFbcYLTeLryOPANdqfI6prRsqjc7uCt1A"&gt;Jim Murphy&lt;/a&gt; wrote that there are four pricing bands: low (&amp;lt; $500), medium ($500-$5,000), dead-zone ($5,000 - $20,000), and high ($20,000+).  What is interesting is the "dead-zone."  In this band the buying cycle is long and complex but the price of the product doesn't quite compensate for the high cost of sale.  I am sure that most successful software vendors understand this either consciously or tacitly and price their products accordingly.  From a buyers perspective, I was thinking that a $21,000 software product may have originally been $8,000  but is priced up  by $13,000 to get out of the dead zone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you look at the CMS market, there are lots of commercial products with sticker prices that hover around $20,000 - $25,000.  This range is much smaller than the actual deal size because the list price of $20,000 may be to license a single CPU with little capacity and no fault-tolerance.  You will probably also need to add support and training which will typically bring the deal size to the $50,000-$90,000 range.  Those figures can certainly justify a sales investment from the vendor.  But, because of the complexity, dependencies, and high stakes of web content management, the cost of sale can be very high (remember, you have to factor in the costs of the losses as well as the wins and a flooded marketplace means lots of lost deals).  Maybe the dead-zone of WCM is even higher than the average.  Maybe it's more like $10,000 - $50,000.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;$50,000 is a lot of money to many web initiatives that tend to have expectations of low costs and rapid results.  Open source products like &lt;a href="http://drupal.org"&gt;Drupal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://joomla.org"&gt;Joomla!&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://wordpress.org"&gt;Wordpress&lt;/a&gt; are doing quite well because they enable design studios (with minimal technical skills) to offer a complete website for half that price by taking a pre-existing theme and some modules and tweaking them just enough to make the site look original. &lt;a href="http://expressionengine.com/"&gt;Expression Engine&lt;/a&gt;, a free but non-open source product, is showing similar success. In these deals the cost of the software sale is essentially zero because the customer is not buying software; they are buying a website.  They are considering font/palette/imagery rather than feature/function/value. Plus, because hosting for these platforms is so ubiquitous, the customer doesn't even have to complicate the transaction by involving their I.T. organization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Commercial CMS vendors that are inflating their price to get above the dead zone are at a real risk here.  Unless they can demonstrate value, their outsized prices will really stick out against products in the bottom two tiers.  I think their best strategy is to shrink the dead zone by reducing the cost of sales.  This means improving their channel sales and giving more access to customers who can take on more of the burden of evaluating the software.  They also need to figure out a way to reward low-touch sales with discounts and charge prospective customers more when they demand the formality and overhead of the traditional enterprise sales cycle.</content>

    <title>CMS Business Case</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;There has been an enormous amount of writing and discussion about building a business case for a CMS and I don't have much to add other than to say that most of what I have heard is totally wrong ;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conventional approach to the problem is to focus on process and efficiency. There is usually some spreadsheet that promises time savings from better tools for editing and accessing content. The estimates are usually wild guesses that have been adjusted to make a particular point. The uncomfortable reality is that most companies are under-investing manpower in managing content. You can't save money by saving labor that you are not applying in the first place. A slightly more reasonable approach (especially in the advertising based industries such as media and publishing) is around the volume of content: more content means more indexed pages that may translate into more search engine traffic that leads to more page impressions and potential for ad click-through. If your content stinks, the equation doesn't work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, the business case discussion should be around the content itself - not the technology used to manage it. This is a difficult conversation to have for a number of reasons. First of all, the human effort required to manage content (no matter what tools you have), while very costly, does not have a big spending event that triggers an ROI conversation. The expenditures from managing content (or the cost of not managing it) happens in drips and drops but it can really bleed a company. Secondly, there is a misperception that all content is good and worth managing. CIO's like to say that "disk is cheap" but it really isn't. The cost of disk drives continually declines but the operational cost of managing the information is actually going up. I don't have any hard data to back this up but I think it is obvious. For every byte on a disk, you need to back it up, you need to organize it, and you need to scroll past it when looking for something else. Most importantly, you need to find it and combine it with other bytes to make actionable information; otherwise, that byte is worthless - less than the cost of saving it no matter how cheap the cost of the disk drive is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Estimating the value of content is hard and frequently complicated by sentimental or otherwise irrational feelings. A person's content is typically more often more valuable to him than it is to others. Not just because he was interested in the topic but also because he feels the need to justify the effort that he invested in creating the content (or paid someone else to do it). There is also a timing aspect. The value of some information goes up over time, while other information goes down. For example, there was a time when the most important piece of content for me was the master's thesis that I was writing. Now, I don't even know if it still exists in paper or digital format. Two years later in the corporate world, I was submitting a purchase request for $8,000 to recover the data off of a 3.5 inch floppy disk that was sitting in some ooze at the bottom of someone's desk drawer. It &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;may&lt;/span&gt; have had an old financial report that was needed for a taking the company public. I will never know because the $8,000 recovery attempt failed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href="http://cmf2007.dk" title="cmf2007"&gt;cmf2007&lt;/a&gt;, Bob Boiko's keynote talked about how we are not yet in the information economy because we have a hard time determining the value of content and the markets for trading information are primitive. Content managers are put into the subservient role of having to post everything that they are given. I would tend to agree with him. I do not feel like companies are any better at deciding what content to keep than the parent of a prolific three year old artist. In fact, I feel like the parent has the edge because he has a finite amount of refrigerator door space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next time you are looking at a new CMS because you are drowning in content but starving for information, ask yourself "is this CMS just a bigger refrigerator door?" "If i just dump my content into another CMS am I really solving the problem?" " Do I really understand the problem?" Those questions are hard to answer without understanding what content you have, what it is worth, and how could be made to be worth more. Here are some questions that I like to ask.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;li&gt;How often are these assets requested?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;li&gt;How often are they revised?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;li&gt;What is the value of the business processes that this content enables?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;li&gt;What is the cost of the content being wrong? This may have to do with brand image, misinformation, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;li&gt;What would you pay to recover this content if you thought it was lost?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;li&gt;How much would another company (maybe a competitor) pay for this information? Not saying that you would sell it, but if you were selling it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;li style="list-style: none"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;You start asking these questions and all of the sudden, content starts looking like the most important asset in your company. It probably is... either that or the people. Just like with people, you can get more out of content by retaining and investing in the right content (and either improving or letting go of worthless content), creating better processes, and providing an environment (or repository) where the content is more productive (accessible). I have never heard of a company trying to calculate the ROI of moving from one office to another. Most companies accept that they need good office space that does not interfere with people doing their jobs. Physical office space is considered a cost of doing business that has very real but complex and difficult to estimate value. It is never considered a substitute for good people or good processes. I wonder if a CMS should be valued in the same way. A CMS will not solve your content management problems but it will make your life more pleasant while you are doing the work. A little like a nice office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content>

    <title>Joining Lionbridge Global Marketing Operations</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Happy New Year!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;2012 is going to be a big year for me.  Starting in January, I will be a full time employee of a new business unit of &lt;a href="http://www.lionbridge.com"&gt;Lionbridge&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href="http://globalmarketingops.com/"&gt;Global Marketing Operations (GMO)&lt;/a&gt;.  The best way to describe GMO is that it is a service that helps global companies execute their global content strategy.  We take great content that marketers and designers produce and make it available to the intended audiences.  This includes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;preparing and instrumenting content for publication in the customer’s content delivery systems (web content management, email campaign management, advertising, etc.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;Operating those delivery systems.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;Localizing (translating and adapting) content for local markets.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;Helping customers understand the effectiveness of their marketing campaigns.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;GMO becomes the arms and legs of the marketing organization to close the gap between strategy and results.  My new title within Lionbridge will be Global Marketing Operations Solutions Manager.  In the near term, I will be optimizing tools and processes to help scale the offering as well as working with GMO clients to help them maximize the value they get from the service.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have been working in content management for over 15 years.  Over that time, I have come to realize that technology is usually not what prevents companies from being successful with content.  Yes, better tools increase efficiency.  But that doesn’t mean having the right tools will lead to success. In fact, I have been noticing that &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2011/01/another-tough-year-for-personalization.html"&gt;many compelling CMS features are under-utilized&lt;/a&gt;. The capabilities are there; the capable people to use them are not (or they just don’t have the time).  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the emergence of content strategy as a main-stream discipline and the pressure on marketers to show quantitative results, this execution gap will only widen and become more visible.  And that’s why this opportunity with Lionbridge GMO is so exciting to me.  This is where I can have the most impact in helping companies be more successful with content.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In practical terms, some things are going to change and others will stay the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, the changes....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;I will no longer be accepting consulting projects through Content Here.  Lionbridge offers a &lt;a href="http://www.slideshare.net/Global_Marketing_Ops/lionbridge-gmo-global-digital-benchmarking-solution-brief"&gt;Global Digital Benchmark&lt;/a&gt; and I will lead the internal component of that offering.  I will also consult with GMO clients and prospects to evaluate their tools and processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;I will write and speak more on the operations, process, and analytics of content management.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;But these things will stay the same....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;I will continue to post to this &lt;a href"http://www.contenthere.net"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/sggottlieb"&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt;.  Some posts will be re-posted on &lt;a href="http://blog.lionbridge.com/marketing/"&gt;GMO blog&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;I will continue to track the content management software industry.  Lionbridge and its clients need to stay up to date with the latest technology developments that improve efficiency and increase reach.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;I will continue to be vendor neutral.  The success of GMO will depend on being able to help customers regardless of their platform.  When it comes to choosing a new platform, Lionbridge is aligned with the customer.  We want to choose the most suitable technology because we will be using it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;I will continue to attend content management conferences and engage with the content management community.  I have great relationships in this community and I think that my work at Lionbridge will provide insights that we all can learn from.  I also look forward to connecting my clients to trusted companies and practitioners that provide tools and  services that Lionbridge does not offer.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you can see, I am pretty excited by this new chapter in my career.  With that, I will wrap this up by wishing everyone a very happy, productive, and rewarding new year.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Navigating the Open Source CMS Landscape</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;In November, I &lt;a href="http://www.optaros.com/pdf/optaros_oscmslandscape_sgottlieb.ppt"&gt;presented&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="http://www.kmworld.com/kmw05/"&gt;KM World and Intranets&lt;/a&gt; conference in San Jose.  It was a fun conference.  There was a sizable group of &lt;a href="http://www.cmprofessionals.org"&gt;CM Professionals&lt;/a&gt; and it was great to hang out and enjoy each other's company:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cmswatch.com"&gt;Tony Byrne of CMS Watch&lt;/a&gt; presentation, "Making Sense of the CMS Vendor Landscape," based on &lt;a href="http://www.cmswatch.com/CMS/Report/"&gt;The CMS Report&lt;/a&gt; was excellent.  Tony brings so much experience and rationality into the CMS selection process.  You should definitely read or hear him before making any decisions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.steptwo.com.au"&gt;James Robertson of Step Two Designs&lt;/a&gt; talked about selecting a CMS with &lt;a href="http://www.steptwo.com.au/papers/cmb_narrativetender/index.html"&gt;narratives&lt;/a&gt;.  This is such a healthy departure from the old, disfunctional feature matrix based selection process.  I talked about the same topic in my presentation but James said it so much more eloquently. After reading his blog and exchanging email, it was great to finally meet him in person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.welchmanconsulting.com/"&gt;Lisa Welchman from Welchman Consulting&lt;/a&gt; gave some valuable homiletic horror stories in her presentation "Lessons Learned from CM Implementations."  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Although I didn't get to see her presentation ("Making a Business Case for CMS"), I enjoyed meeting &lt;a href="http://netjmc.com/"&gt;Jane McConnell from NetStrategy&lt;/a&gt; on a rare visit from France.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Speaking of European invasions, &lt;a href="http://www.boyeit.dk/home"&gt;Janus Boye of Boye IT from Denmark&lt;/a&gt; made the trip and we finally were able to meet face to face.  He and &lt;a href="http://www.anexinet.com/"&gt;Travis Wissink of Anexinet&lt;/a&gt; teamed up to talk about content integration through Portals, Content Bridges and Enterprise Services Buses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://ecmarchitect.com/"&gt;Jeff Potts from Navigator&lt;/a&gt; gave an excellent case study on an intranet initative at &lt;a href="http://www.southwest.com/"&gt;Southwest Airlines&lt;/a&gt;.  It was a nice mix of technical description and methodology and organizational factors that helped the project succeed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Events like these make the value of a CM Professionals membership obvious.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another conference highlight was Tony Byrne's production of &lt;i&gt;CMS Idol&lt;/i&gt; where several vendors were given 7 minutes to demo their product then be scathingly critiqued by a panel of judges (James Robertson as Simon, Lisa Welchman as Paula, and Janus Boye as Randy) &lt;a href="http://www.idolonfox.com/"&gt;American Idol&lt;/a&gt; style.  The winner was determined by the audience.  Tony hosted another CMS Idol at the &lt;a href="http://www.gilbane.com/conferences/Boston_05.html"&gt;Boston Gilbane Conference&lt;/a&gt;.  It is an excellent concept.  In seven minutes you are able to see what the CMS vendor really thinks is important and see the personality of the company.  Some companies try to show breadth and range, others highlight simplicity and fitness to task.  I also think these events are useful to the vendors because they can see how different demo styles resonate with a sample audience - just like a focus group.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>When the Drupal Developer Comes Around</title>
    <content type='html'>Apologies for the totally misused Johnny Cash reference but Austin Smith has an excellent post on &lt;a href="http://www.inertweb.com/2008/12/21/how-i-learned-love-drupal"&gt;how he came around from being a Drupal hater to a Drupal lover&lt;/a&gt;.  Austin works on &lt;a href="http://www.observer.com"&gt;Observer.com&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.politicker.com/"&gt;Politicker.com&lt;/a&gt; - two early, high profile &lt;a href="http://drupal.org"&gt;Drupal&lt;/a&gt; sites.  Austin's background is primarily Java and PHP (written in the style of Java). He was at first put off by the object disoriented-ness of the Drupal programming model and the chaos that Drupal customization tends to attract.  What brought him around was the huge Drupal community and the realization that you could write clean code in Drupal.  He also has some great advice for developers having difficulty coming to terms with Drupal.</content>

    <title>Sandro Groganz steps down from OSCOM</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Sandro Groganz, from &lt;a href="http://ez.no"&gt;eZ systems&lt;/a&gt;, just stepped down as president of &lt;a href="http://www.oscom.org"&gt;OSCOM&lt;/a&gt; after taking over from Michael Wechner when Michael resigned.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think an organization like OSCOM has the potential to deliver great value and it is puzzling (at least on the surface) why a group of open source project leaders, who have proven their ability to lead collaborative initiatives, have failed to keep OSCOM on the rails.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think that the problem is an uneven balance of effort and reward.  In a good open source project, you get more than you give because every contribution that you make will be maintained and has the opportunity to be improved upon.  Plus, it is likely that you needed to make the fix or add the feature for yourself anyway.  OSCOM, on the other hand takes people away from the immediate things that they need to do to make a living.  The rewards are too abstract and distant to affect an immediate decision of what to do with your time.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OSCOM is all about the greater good and provides very little immediate personal good.   A less influential open source project might invest time in OSCOM to get exposure and establish a name for itself.  But the larger projects have their own communities to worry about and are less concerned with open source content management in the abstract.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, if the OSCOM concept is flawed (I don't know this for sure, but lets say it is for sake of argument) what are alternative ways to deliver the benefits of promotion of standards, collaborative innovation across projects, and promotion of the open source alternative?  Here are some ideas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Get involved with some general content management organizations such as &lt;a href="http://www.aiim.org"&gt;AIIM&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.cmprofessionals.org"&gt;CM Professionals&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Submit standards to existing standards bodies.  For example there was a lot of open source input into the &lt;a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=170"&gt;JCR standard&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Attend each others conferences.  By attending another project's conference, an open source developer can get new ideas and also build professional relationships with other developers that he can potentially collaborate with on shared components.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Establish joint projects for share components.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other constituency that also loses with the collapse of OSCOM are the users who were not really contributing but would have benefited from a centralized place to learn about open source content management software.  The &lt;a href="http://www.oscom.org/matrix/index.html"&gt;CM Matrix&lt;/a&gt;, which never really lived up to its full potential, was a valuable resource but not quite as good as &lt;a href="http://www.cmsmatrix.org/"&gt;CMS Matrix&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.opensourcecms.com/"&gt;Open Source CMS&lt;/a&gt;.  Planet OSCOM that aggregated a bunch of open source developer blogs does not seem to work any more.  Perhaps, that could be moved over to &lt;a href="http://www.cms-news.org/"&gt;CMS-News&lt;/a&gt; or some good &lt;a href="http://del.icio.us/"&gt;del.icio.us tagging&lt;/a&gt;.</content>

    <title>Review: Alfresco Developer Guide</title>
    <content type='html'>I just finished reading &lt;a href="http://ecmarchitect.com/"&gt;Jeff Pott's&lt;/a&gt; new book &lt;a href="http://www.packtpub.com/alfresco-developer-guide/book"&gt;Alfresco Developer Guide&lt;/a&gt;. If you have been looking for a technical book on how to develop applications on top of the Alfresco platform, this is it.  Jeff wastes little time introducing abstract content management concepts or explaining the user interface, he digs right into setting up your local development environment.  I like this approach but it assumes a solid foundation in both ECM and Java - if you don't have one, there are plenty of other books to start with.  The expectation of some baseline knowledge saves the book from getting bogged down with introducing Spring, jBPM, and many of the other popular Java frameworks and components that make up Alfresco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The book is written with a bias toward the document management end of the ECM spectrum but that makes sense for a book about Alfresco.  Only one chapter (out of 9) is devoted to Alfresco's WCM component.  The core strength of book is how it teaches developer to build &lt;em&gt;dynamic web applications and services that access documents from the Alfresco repository&lt;/em&gt; (which may be the core strength of Alfresco too). There is great coverage on Alfresco's Web Scripts framework with plenty of interesting examples that showcase the flexibility of the platform.  For example, there is a nice description of how to create an AJAX document rating widget you could put on another website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jeff's writing style is both thorough and readable.  He has a nice technique of pulling up and explaining details in "What Just Happened?" sections.  This allows him to run cleanly through a topic and then summarize and discuss some of the nuances of the steps.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately for Jeff, his book (which covers 2.2 of the Enterprise Edition) came out right around the time version 3.0 was released.  However, since he writes mainly about the API level, the book will stay relevant and accurate longer (Luckily API's can't change as fast as user interfaces).  So,  if you are a Java developer and are considering using Alfresco for building a "document centric web application," this book will help.</content>

    <title>The Format-ist</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I recently read Richard Thompson's excellent post &lt;a href="http://www.richtext.com/2011/03/03/is-content-strategy-biased-towards-the-written-word/"&gt;"Is content strategy biased towards the written word?"&lt;/a&gt;  I have to admit that during my read and also during the many moments of reflection that followed, I found myself thinking "but there is a good reason to focus on text as the primary format of content."  Other content formats are best used to enhance the written word.  Heck, I even wrote a blog post &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2010/03/text-killed-the-multi-media-star.html"&gt;extolling the superiority of the written word over text&lt;/a&gt;.  All the while, however, I was nagged by the possibility (rather probability) that I was projecting my personal own bias.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned in my post, I don't have the patience to wait for information to be spooled out at a pace that I cannot control.  I like to scan and search and you can't do that very easily in a video or audio.  But, I also agree with Rich's point is that many of the most popular websites are filled with non-text content so I would be foolish to deny the appeal.  But then I think that these sites are primarily for entertainment purposes and when I am in leisure mode, I am not so goal oriented.  I like experiences like movies where I can sit back and let a story unfold.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you can see with my flip-flopping, I haven't made up my mind on this issue but, like Rich, I am starting to be more aware of the circumstances when non-textual content would be preferable to text.  Ideas that come to mind are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Any form of entertainment (many people are more likely to watch a movie or listen to an audio book than read the book on which it was based)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Instruction on topics where technique is critical such as hitting a baseball or disarming a nuclear warhead&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Things that you need to see to believe like pictures of a flooded town.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can you think of other times when non-text content can go further than the written word?  One thing is for certain; when you decide that you can communicate better with non-text content, you better be sure.  Many organizations struggle to maintain their text-based content and non-text content is vastly harder to manage.  You need more sophisticated skills and tools to update a video or audio track &amp;mdash; even a picture.  But maybe that is just my own bias peeking out again.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type='html'>Hi Seth - This is an interesting diagram. It raises more questions than answers for me, but starts an important discussion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think it works better when first bucketing organizations in categories vs. leading with specific ones. Otherwise it doesn&amp;#39;t scale. But I understand it was a process to help articulate where you stood, not map the landscape (this is your blog after all!).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As noted above, the role of analysts aren&amp;#39;t represented accurately on the buy side. Folks like Forrester play a huge role educating buyers with reports and consulting, and go much further downstream than indicated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While not as plentiful, I do see quite a few independents or small orgs serving in your space as &amp;#39;CMS consultancies&amp;#39; offering vendor neutral advice while not tied to a larger organization.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I also think its dangerous to cast system integrators in a big bucket or assume they all approach it with the same rigor.  Some system integrators/interactive agencies have true consulting services for WCM and technology selections regardless of what they may or may not specialize in for delivery.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While I&amp;#39;m not angling to be on your diagram here (really, i&amp;#39;m not :), my firm, ISITE Design (we also publish the CMS Myth) does vendor neutral CMS vendor selection projects independent of our full service work. On par at the level James mentions above in terms of scope and number per year. We take a lot of pride in these services and try to fit it into a larger web strategy picture that more tool-focused consultants often don&amp;#39;t.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What&amp;#39;s clear is that everyone has their biases and specialties on this list (yes even vendor neutral folks), and the buyers need to be very aware of who they are getting information from.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&amp;#39;ll chew on this some more. Nice post.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jeff Cram&lt;br&gt;CMS Myth (and ISITE Design)</content>

    <title>Great Dialog About Open Source Business</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;My colleague &lt;a href="http://stephesblog.blogs.com/about.html"&gt;Stephen Walli&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://asay.blogspot.com/"&gt;Matt Asay&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="http://www.alfresco.com"&gt;Alfresco&lt;/a&gt; had an &lt;a href="http://stephesblog.blogs.com/my_weblog/2006/05/the_upside_of_o.html"&gt;excellent dialog&lt;/a&gt; on Stephe's blog about what it means to be an open source company and how an open source software company should view its users.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To give you a little background on the topic, Matt wrote &lt;a href="http://asay.blogspot.com/2006/04/infrastructure-you-get-what-you-pay.html"&gt;several&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://asay.blogspot.com/2006/05/downside-of-open-source-business.html"&gt;posts&lt;/a&gt; essentially saying that you get what you pay for and, if you want good software, you need to pay for it otherwise you are essentially cheating the system.  We feel that people can contribute back to an open source project in many ways including simply using it and by doing so, testing it, and contributing ideas.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stephe, &lt;a href="http://www.gynn.org/roller/page/dgynn/"&gt;Dave Gynn&lt;/a&gt;, Matt and I are friends going back prior to Matt's joining Alfresco.  These conversations are extremely constructive and I think that it is great that they are happening out in the open.  In the commercial software world, you wouldn't see &lt;a href="http://www.optaros.com/np/company_news_03-21-06.shtml"&gt;partners&lt;/a&gt; debating in public.  But that is the beauty of open source.  Everything happens out in the open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Planning for Localization</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Localization can be an elusive requirement for a website.  During the platform selection process, internationalization is often listed as a "strong" requirement.  Why wouldn't you want the ability to reach new markets?  Then, during the implementation process, localizing gets downgraded as a "nice to have" or "future" requirement as time and resources dwindle and compromises need to be made to launch the primary language site.  Eventually, localization becomes an "oh crap" requirement when someone expects to have a "Spanish version of the site up ASAP".  After all, localization &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; part of the business case and a key selling point of the platform.  Yes, localizing the site would have been as easy as hiring translators &lt;em&gt;if only&lt;/em&gt; some accommodations had been made during initial implementation.  But they were not.  Hence the "oh crap."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;While you may not have budget to localize your website during your initial CMS implementation, following these steps will make adding a new language easier down the road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learn how internationalization works on your platform.&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Different platforms have different approaches and best practices for internationalization.  If you make the modest investment to fully understand these techniques, you will at least make educated decisions about how to defer localization and not rule it out.  If you are working with a systems integrator, which I highly recommend, make sure they have experience building (and maintaining) localized websites on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use the translation framework provided from the templating system.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Any given web page will have a lot of static text that lives in templates (as opposed to in the content).  For example, there might be a label on the upper right that says "search" or a copyright statement on the bottom of the page.  It is not practical to manage these little "content crumbs" through your usual editorial workflow &amp;mdash; they are small, numerous, easy to lose track of, and rarely change.  But if you are planning on localizing your site, you don't want those strings in your templates either.  It is much better manage these strings separately in "resource" or "message" files that can be shipped off to translators.  Most templating languages come with a system for invoking externally managed strings. For example, in JSP Standard Tag Library, translated strings are invoked like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        &amp;lt;fmt:message key="some.text"/&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;In eZ Publish they look like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        {"Some text you are going to translate"|i18n('design/standard/node')}&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Setting this up is easy enough to do when you are building out your templates for the first time.  However, it is very tedious to retrofit old mono-lingual templates with this system.  You wind up doing it for templates that are no longer used "just in case." Worse of all, you have to visually re-inspect every pixel of the site because you are touching nearly every line of view code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep text out of images.&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Having text in images adds a lot of friction to the localization process. First, you must remember to keep the image source files on-hand so you can produce the translated versions. Second, the translation process goes through additional steps of extracting and then re-imported the localized text.  Managing all of those image files can be a real pain too.  It is much better to float text over image backgrounds for buttons, navigation, and slides.  Incidentally, applying this practice will also help with SEO and accessibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make room for other languages.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;p&gt;Think as your primary language as the first of several languages when you are designing your content repository and defining roles and workflows.  These localized content collections need a place to live.  They will need access control so that a local team can safely work in their content without risking the overall content repository.  Pay special attention to how "global" reusable content components are managed and retrieved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Buy your top level domains NOW.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you will be publishing your sites to different markets, start working on acquiring those top level domains (like .fr or .es).  It will be really embarrassing to enter into a new market only to find someone else squatting on your domain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set the appropriate character encoding&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the time this is a non-issue because most modern technologies default to UTF-8.  Just make sure that you set up your databases with UTF-8 encoding and collation.  Some older versions of programming languages require adjustments when dealing with Unicode too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you think localization may be in your future, plan for it now.  Take the additional steps to reduce rework and risk when you are under the gun to get that new language published.  If you didn't follow this advice, I would look into &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2012/02/introduction-to-translation-proxies.html"&gt;translation proxies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Variable control lists</title>
    <content type='html'>Your typical editor is conflicted.  On the one hand, he likes to have direct control over what articles are promoted on every page of the site.  On the other hand, he realizes that he may not have the time to exert this control.  When editors have to manually place articles in every promotional list, they risk letting the important pages (home pages and section front pages) get stale as they tend to other things.  When they allow the templating logic to automatically select articles to highlight, they get frustrated by the judgement of automated filtering rules ("why is that article promoted more than this more important article?").  They want to be able to override the automated logic when they have the idea that they could do better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a classic trick to establish compromise between the extremes of manual control and automation. I have implemented this on many different web content management platforms and it should work on yours.  I call it "variable control lists."  The basic idea is that you allow an editor to select 0-&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; articles to include in a promotional list that displays n items.  The template logic shows the articles that the editor selected and then fills in the rest of the positions with the results of a query.   So, if an editor picks 0 articles to spotlight, the template logic selects n.  If the editor selects 3, the template logic selects n-3 articles and lists them after the editors picks.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of nuances should be considered.  First, you want to make sure that supplemental list does not include any of the same articles that the editor selected.  Second, you might want to apply some additional rules like having the template disregard the editor's picks if they are past a certain age.  That really depends on the type of site you are running. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it out and see how it works for you.  I am especially interested in learning of platforms that this would &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; work on. &lt;br /&gt;</content>

    <title>Internet Explorer, you did it again</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I learned something new about IE9 today.  Apparently, when visiting a site in the same domain as the computer, IE9  defaults to compatibility (quirks) mode.  I am guessing that this is Microsoft trying to accommodate crappy intranet sites (cough cough SHAREPOINT cough cough).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, if your site depends on standards mode, you might find that it looks fine in the real world but not in the office.  I work remotely and this has burned me twice.  Both times my launch celebration was cut short by complaints from colleagues in the office who saw broken pages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now I know....  &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/11096186"&gt;And you do too&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hat tip to &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pub/marjoe-bacus/8a/478/517"&gt;Marjoe Bacus&lt;/a&gt; for letting me know about this "feature".&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>MTV UK on Drupal</title>
    <content type='html'>Systems integrator and web design shop &lt;a href="http://www.lullabot.com"&gt;Lullabot&lt;/a&gt; is redesigning and implementing the British MTV site &lt;a href="http://mtv.co.uk"&gt;mtv.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; using &lt;a href="http://drupal.org"&gt;Drupal&lt;/a&gt;.  I find it interesting how Drupal, which has historically used as a digital community building tool ("Community Plumbing"), is turning into a real option for media companies.  On the one side, Drupal has demonstrated itself to be serious, reliable software capable of handling heavy traffic.  On the other, you have media companies shifting from a broadcast model to more bidirectional publishing where their readership actively interacts with and posts content.  Traditional media companies with established audiences are realizing the need to evolve the relationship with their audience to a more collaborative network or else risk losing attention to upstart Web 2.0 sites which have been so successful in growing virally.</content>

    <title>Packt Open Source Content Management System Award, 2007</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://www.packtpub.com"&gt;Packt Publishing&lt;/a&gt; is holding their second annual &lt;a href="http://www.packtpub.com/article/nominate-overall-open-source-cms-winner"&gt;Open Source Content Management System&lt;/a&gt; competition. Most of the project mailing lists that I subscribe to are announcing the competition and encouraging subscribers to vote.  &lt;a href="http://www.packtpub.com/article/nominate-overall-open-source-cms-winner"&gt;You can vote too.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this competition will not tell you what CMS is right for you, it does give visibility into the volume (in people and decibels) of the community and the general, mass market appeal of the product.  The 2006 winner was &lt;a href="http://www.joomla.org"&gt;Joomla!&lt;/a&gt; followed by &lt;a href="http://drupal.org"&gt;Drupal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://plone.org"&gt;Plone&lt;/a&gt;.  This year, there will be multiple categories to try to spread the wealth (larger prize purse  this year).  The categories are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Overall Winner&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Most Promising Open Source CMS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Best Open Source PHP CMS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Best Other Open Source CMS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Best Social Networking CMS&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I would like to see is more categories focused on intended use.  Social Networking CMS is an example, I think there could be categories for "Web Publishing System" (for things like online periodicals), "Website Management Tool" (for managing a corporate brochure site), and "Web Application Development Framework" (for building interactive, content centric applications).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thecontentwrangler.com"&gt;Scott Abel&lt;/a&gt; is one of the judges this year.  If you have ever seen him do one of the "Idol" competitions at Gilbane or another conference, you know you can expect some funny commentary.</content>

    <title>CM Professionals Announces Management Committee and Executive Director</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Today &lt;a href="http://www.cmprofessionals.org"&gt;CM Professionals&lt;/a&gt; officially &lt;a href="http://www.cmprofessionals.org/about_cm_pros/press_releases/index.html#apr2505"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; the formation of a Management Committee and appointment of a new Executive Director.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Management Committee consists of:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Patricia Kelley, content architect at Allstate Insurance - Director of Marketing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Erik Hartman, president of Netherlands-based Hartman Communicatie BV - Director of Member Relations&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Glen Secor, senior consultant and legal analyst with The Gilbane Report -  Legal Advisor&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hilary Marsh, president of strategic online consultancy Content Company Inc. - Director of Communications&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laura Walker succeeds Bob Doyle as Executive Director of CM Professionals.  I personally would like to thank Bob for his tireless energy and drive to get CM Professionals off the ground.  The organization would not be the success that it is without his dedication and talents.  Bob will continue to play an active role in CM Professionals as Technology Advisor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laura Walker will bring new perspectives and skills to the Executive Director role. Her experience as the executive director of &lt;a href="http://www.oasis-open.org"&gt;OASIS&lt;/a&gt; will be critical in helping CM Professionals achieve its potential.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read the full &lt;a href="http://www.cmprofessionals.org/about_cm_pros/press_releases/index.html#apr2505"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Nan, you are not a number</title>
    <content type='html'>Here is a little programming oddity that we ran across yesterday.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href="https://ondemand.lionbridge.com/"&gt;onDemand&lt;/a&gt; has a number of downloadable Excel reports.  To generate a useful Excel file, it is important to tell the Excel library what data type to make each cell.  To facilitate this, we had a little utility function called is_float:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;def is_float(data):

    try:
        float(data)
        return True
    except Exception:
        return False
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That seemed reasonable enough and it worked fine for quite some time. But then we had this customer named Nan (thanks for the business Nan!).  The problem with the name Nan is that float('Nan') doesn't return a ValueError like float('Bob').  float('Nan') successfully returns a float object with a value of 'nan.'  The reason for this is that Nan, in addition to a being fairly common name (I went to school with a girl named Nan), is Python shorthand for a "Not a Number."  Python's float function interpreted the input 'Nan' as an attempt to create a float object with a value of 'nan'.  This caused our logic to try to tell the Excel library that 'Nan' was a number and that created an error.  Incidentally, we would have had the same problem with someone named "Inf," which is Python shorthand for infinity.&lt;br /&gt;
In case anyone is curious, the fix for this was quite simple:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;def is_float(data):

    try:
        int(float(data))
        return True
    except Exception:
        return False
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The int function doesn't try to be as clever.  It rejects cheeky floats like nan and inf.  You learn something new every day!</content>

    <title>Plone vs. MOSS</title>
    <content type='html'>Francesco Ciriaci has started a &lt;a href="http://francescociriaci.wordpress.com/2008/12/22/plone-vs-moss-round-1/"&gt;series comparing Plone and MOSS&lt;/a&gt; in response to a trend of companies choosing between these two platforms.  This first article focuses on general features and licensing.  Key differences are the obvious Microsoft dependency of MOSS (which could be a good or bad thing depending on your technology strategy), licensing costs, and the availability of modules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another usual suspect in a selection for an Intranet collaboration platform with some web publishing capabilities is &lt;a href="http://www.alfresco.com"&gt;Alfresco&lt;/a&gt;.  The Alfresco marketing and engineering department have been beating on Microsoft's door with their &lt;a href="http://wiki.alfresco.com/wiki/Alfresco_Labs_3_Share_Feature_List"&gt;Share&lt;/a&gt; product.  Alfresco also integrates with SharePoint by supporting the &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc339472.aspx"&gt;SharePoint Protocols&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While there is considerable functional overlap between these solutions, the pricing systems of these products are very different.  Alfresco is sold through a per-CPU commercial licensing scheme (customers are advised not to use the free open source Community Edition).  Typically this will work out to roughly 40K per year for a medium size company that actively uses the system.  MOSS is sold on a per user basis.  This is good for small to medium size companies but gets very expensive when MOSS spreads virally across very large companies (as it typically does).  Plone is totally GPL licensed and has no recurring support fees (it can be somewhat difficult to find a commercial-style support program for Plone. Email me if you are looking for one.  I know some people).</content>

    <title>Day&amp;#39;s new developer portal and blog</title>
    <content type='html'>Via &lt;a href="http://www.cmswire.com/cms/enterprise-cms/swiss-cms-vendor-day-launches-developer-portal-and-blog-002450.php"&gt;CMSWire&lt;/a&gt; (because I missed the press release in my in-box - sorry Patrick).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.day.com"&gt;Day Software&lt;/a&gt; recently launched a new &lt;a href="http://dev.day.com"&gt;blog and developer portal&lt;/a&gt;.  The intent of the portal is to be for content management experts, by content management experts and focus on content technology standards.  Day definitely has the horsepower to produce good content with on-staff visionaries like David Nuescheler (the driving force behind &lt;a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=170"&gt;JSR 170&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href="http://roy.gbiv.com/"&gt;Roy "the REST man" Fielding&lt;/a&gt;, and collaboration and open source expert &lt;a href="http://weblogs.goshaky.com/weblogs/lars/"&gt;Lars Trieloff&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Color me subscribed! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, I just noticed from the RSS feed that the title is "(content goes here) blog." What's up with that?</content>

    <content type='html'>At the broadest level, I cant disagree.  For some folks, Open Source makes sense, but for others, Interwoven makes sense.  The requirements that open source makes sense for will tend to be smaller or medium size companies, and Interwoven TeamSite and LiveSite will make sense for larger enterprises.  &lt;br&gt;Interwoven blog post is referring to those companies - and most Interwoven customers are either large enterprises or companies for whom the web presence is complex.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If I agree, why I am I commenting ?  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a former Interwoven SE, I do feel that both the original post and Kevin&amp;#39;s response are out of date.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I certainly was not a &amp;#39;crack SE&amp;#39;, but certainly show the same demo to every customer (cetainly not 100 times, and never a mutual fund).  Making it work with a customer&amp;#39;s site takes a day, even for one as inexperienced at the time as me.   The same priciple applies for production systems.  Real customer implementations for doing what customers used to do - has got a lot shorter.  If projects today take same time they used to, it is because customers are simply doing a lot more - content targeting and user experience testing for example.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Partly thanks to decisions Kevin made while he was at Interwoven, their offering (TeamSite + LiveSite)is lot more comprehensive and a lot easier, than when he was there.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So bottom line, I am backing my old friend Annie&amp;#39;s blogpost.  I think she is up to date with current open source offerings - the question is, are you up to date with Interwoven ?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I recently left Interwoven to work for a non-WCM part-competitor, so would rather not leave my name.</content>

    <content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/38298452@N00/3305543608" title="View 'alfrescal' on Flickr.com"&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3638/3305543608_300f9801f0_m.jpg" alt="alfrescal" border="0" width="220" height="240" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jeff Potts&lt;a href="http://ecmarchitect.com/archives/2009/02/23/908"&gt; recently announced the general availability of an integration between Drupal and Alfresco&lt;/a&gt;. The integration uses &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_Management_Interoperability_Services"&gt;CMIS&lt;/a&gt; and could potentially connect &lt;a href="http://drupal.org"&gt;Drupal&lt;/a&gt; to any CMIS compliant repository.  While I would call this type of Drupal configuration  experimental (that is, don't try to run &lt;a href="http://www.theonion.com"&gt;The Onion&lt;/a&gt; on it), it does show potential.  &lt;a href="http://www.alfresco.com"&gt;Alfresco's&lt;/a&gt; focus on web content management has been as an extension of internal collaboration (i.e. publishing internal knowledge assets out onto the web).  Alfresco doesn't have a strong vision on pure web publishing or hosting community websites.  The front end delivery part of Alfresco is just emerging through its &lt;a href="http://wiki.alfresco.com/wiki/Surf_Platform"&gt;Surf framework&lt;/a&gt;.  Drupal, conversely, is &lt;em&gt;all about the front end&lt;/em&gt;.  There is a similar &lt;a href="http://extensions.joomla.org/extensions/3548/details"&gt;Alfresco integration available for Joomla!&lt;/a&gt;, which provides a menu set that reads from an Alfresco repository.  This integration also uses CMIS as an interface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My main hesitation with recommending this configuration (or the Joomla! one for that matter) to my clients &lt;em&gt;right now&lt;/em&gt; is that the Alfresco repository is not fast enough to be the runtime behind a high traffic website - certainly not the AVM and probably not the DM either right now.  Most Alfresco powered websites publish flat HTML pages or push out the content as XML to be rendered by a de-coupled delivery tier (&lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2007/06/cms-deployment-patterns.html"&gt;see deployment patterns&lt;/a&gt;).  There is an &lt;a href="http://wiki.alfresco.com/wiki/Alfresco_opencms"&gt;integration that puts OpenCMS in front of Alfresco&lt;/a&gt;, but that works by replicating a folder in the repository over to the OpenCMS repository (&lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2007/07/alfrescoopencms-integration.html"&gt;see my write up here&lt;/a&gt;).  That seems more scalable from a traffic perspective.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the near term, I think that the best use for this integration is for customers who use Alfresco for their Intranet and want to publish some of their internally-managed documents out to low-traffic pages on their website (perhaps some PDFs of investor relations documents or job application forms).  In the longer term, performance and scalability of the Alfresco repository are expected to improve.  Performance is a key focus for the next releases (3.1 and 3.2).  In particular, they are building the infrastructure for improved load testing so they can optimize for intensive concurrent access by thousands of users.  These improvements will certainly make a fully Alfresco-backed, high traffic Drupal or Joomla! site more viable.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Bricolage for Print</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;There was a recent thread on the &lt;a href="www.bricolage.cc"&gt;Bricolage&lt;/a&gt; mailing list about using Bricolage to support print as well as web publishing. Given Bricolage's history and focus on publishing magazines and other periodicals, I am not surprised that there were some good anwers.  One of the respondents recommended creating presentation templates that write to an XML format that can be imported into &lt;a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/indesign/"&gt;Adobe InDesign CS&lt;/a&gt;.  In InDesign, you can create style sheets where you map incoming XML tags to InDesign layouts.  If you don't have Adobe InDesign, another option is to use &lt;a href="http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/"&gt;Apache XML:FOP&lt;/a&gt; (pronounced Pho as in the Vietnamese food or Faux as in fake) which stands for Formatting Objects Processor.  XML FOP is a very cool technology which takes an XML format and can output to different print formats with an emphasis on PDF. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By using this technique, you can get excellent re-use between your print and web content and you will also be able to leverage Bricolage's powerful workflow functionality.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Content is not Data</title>
    <content type='html'>David Nuescheler, CTO of &lt;a href="http://www.day.com"&gt;Day Software&lt;/a&gt; and spec lead for the Java Content Repository specifications JSR &lt;a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=170"&gt;170&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=283"&gt;283&lt;/a&gt;, likes to say "everything is content." This is a bold statement that is intended provoke thought but I think that it is also a reaction to a prevailing view among technologists and database vendors that everything (including content) is just data. While it is true that content, when stored electronically, is just a bunch of 0's and 1's, if you think that content is just data, you need to get out of the server room because that is not how your users see it. There are four main reasons why.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Content has a voice.&lt;/strong&gt; Put another way, content is trying to communicate something. Like me writing this blog post, a content author tries to express an idea, make a point, or convince someone of something. Communication is hard and requires a creative process so authoring content takes much more time than recording data. Content is personal. If the author is writing on behalf of a company, there may need to be approvals to ensure the voice and opinion of the company is being represented. The author may refer to raw data to support his point, but he is interpreting. For example, even a graph of data may reflect some decisions about what data to include and how to show them. Because content has a voice, content is subjective. We consider the authority and perspective of the author when we decide whether we can trust it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Content has ownership.&lt;/strong&gt; Data usually do not have a copyright but content does. The people who produce content, like reports, movies, and music, get understandably annoyed when people copy and redistribute their work. While data can be licensed, it is less common. Often data are distributed widely so that more people can provide insight into what they mean. Interestingly, when content is digitally stored as data on a disk, we think less about it in terms of content. For example, we are OK with data backups of copyrighted material even though creating copies is forbidden.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Content is intended for a human audience.&lt;/strong&gt; While content management purists strive for a total separation of content and presentation, content authors care about how content is being presented. They may have a lot of control over presentation and obsess over every line wrap or they only get to choose what words are bolded or italicized. They will only semantically tag a phrases in a document if they know that it will make for a richer experience for the audience. Presentation is not just for vanity's sake. Presentation, when done well, helps the audience understand the content by giving cues as to how things are organized and what is important. While the Semantic Web is all about machines understanding web content, at the end of the day, the machines are just agents trying to find useful information for human eyeballs (and eardrums). Content is authored with the audience in mind while data is just recorded.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Content has context.&lt;/strong&gt; In addition to who wrote the content, where it appears also matters. We care greatly how content is classified and organized because we want to make it easier to find. A database table doesn't care about the order of its rows (it is up to the application to determine how they should be sorted). Content contributors really care about where their assets fall in lists (everything from index pages to search results).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These distinctions may seem totally academic but I think they have real implications for the technologies that manage content. Because content is much more than "unstructured data," we can't think about the tools we use to manage and store it just in terms of big text fields in a relational database and forms to update these rows. Content is a personal experience for both the author and the audience and the technology that intermediates needs to be sensitive to that. Every once in a while there is a meme about "content management" becoming an irrelevant term because it will be subsumed into other more process or industry oriented disciplines. If that does happen, it is critical that certain content technology features and concepts carry over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Versioning.&lt;/strong&gt; Content goes through a life cycle of evolution and refinement as groups of contributors work together to achieve the best way to convey the information and ideas. Some content assets (like policies and procedures) are updated hundreds of times over many years as information changes. Other assets go through many rapid iterations over a shorter period of time (such as an intensely negotiated contract). Often participants in a content life cycle need to know just what has changed. For example, a copyeditor can save time by just proofreading the changes since the previous copy edit. A translator may not need to re-translate an asset if only a minor edit was made. Sometimes the history of change can give insight into the spirit of meaning. Versioning is not just for reverting to older versions. A robust versioning system has features like version comparison and annotations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Control over the delivery.&lt;/strong&gt; To effectively communicate, you need to tune your delivery to your audience. WYSIWYG editing and preview both try to give a content contributor the perspective of their audience. WYSIWYG editing gives a non-technical contributor some control over the styling over text. It is important that the WYSIWYG editor gives an accurate representation (as in the same CSS styles) of what a visitor will see. Single page preview puts the content into the context of a page by executing rendering logic. The more complex the rendering logic, the more difficult it is to control what the user sees. For example, if there is some logic to automatically display relevant related content, the preview environment has to have the same content, rendering code, and user session information as the production environment. Oftentimes, this is hard to do. I have had clients really struggle over controlling dynamic rendering logic. For example, a relevance engine automatically associated inappropriate images with articles or showed the same related content multiple times. Some users also like to see how articles show up on dynamic indices and search results. In these complex delivery tiers, preview is a lot more like software QA than simple visual verification - you need to test all the scenarios and parameters. A good practice is to delineate pages or sections that you want full editorial control over and other (less important sections) that are not worth the manual effort of controlling.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feedback.&lt;/strong&gt; You can't communicate in a vacuum. You need feedback. However, most content contributors lob their content over the wall and then forget about it. When you are speaking in front of a group you can gauge reaction and make adjustments. As the web turns into a conversation, the content contributor needs to be listening as much as they are telling. Most content contributors underuse web analytics. The more accessible this information can be made, the better. Many web content management systems integrate analytics packages and have nice features like analytics overlays over rendered pages. However, these features are not used enough. More commonly, an analytics report will be circulated around to people who don't understand how to read it. Comments and voting can also be a powerful medium for adjusting and reacting to feedback either by direct response or by using knowledge of the audience in subsequent articles.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Metadata.&lt;/strong&gt; While metadata storage is trivial, capturing and using this information is a challenge. Metadata such as source and ownership are critical to tell the audience where the asset comes from (its voice and authority) and how it can be legally used. Metadata is also important for classification and context. Content contributors are notoriously bad at metadata entry: &lt;a href="http://contenthere.blogspot.com/2006/01/gsa-meta-data-not-essential-for-search.html"&gt;they either neglect or abuse it&lt;/a&gt;. Automation is part of the solution, but a good process involves humans with the responsibility for metadata (bring on the librarians!). The best way to leverage and exchange metadata is through standards based formats. Industry oriented formats (like &lt;a href="http://www.nitf.org"&gt;NITF&lt;/a&gt;) are important because they have a standard set of metadata built in. Microformats are also useful for highlighting specific bits of standard information within rendered web pages. While most WCM platforms can produce these outputs through their templating tier, very few do any validation of the output. Reviewers just visually validate what they see on a preview page.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Usability.&lt;/strong&gt; Most of all the system needs to be easy to use. Creating content is hard work no matter how you do it. Any system that distracts or complicates a user from the creative process of developing content is bound to be un-popular and the first excuse for failure. The ideal content management system disappears from the user's consciousness by being familiar and frictionless - you don't need to think about it and it gives you immediate results. For many people, that is Microsoft Word (until Word tries to outsmart you and take over your document) and I have already mentioned &lt;a href="http://blog.contenthere.net/2008/03/reconsidering-email.html"&gt;the disturbing amount of web content that originates in MS Word&lt;/a&gt;. For some, blogging tools are approaching this level of usability. For others, in-context editing achieves it. In many cases users get so familiar with a tool that they forget they are using it even if the tool is hard to learn at first (I am reminded of this when my fingers just automatically type the right commands in &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi"&gt;vi&lt;/a&gt;). This usually only happens when you have specialists operating the CMS rather than a distributed authoring where all the contributors enter their own content.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you are building an application that also needs to manage content, don't just think of the content in terms of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete"&gt;CRUD&lt;/a&gt; for semi-structured data. Luckily, components and frameworks are available to incorporate into your architecture. The &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/products-page/reports/open-source-content-management-in-java"&gt;Open Source Web Content Management in Java report&lt;/a&gt; covers &lt;a href="http://www.alfresco.com"&gt;Alfresco&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.hippocms.org/display/CMS/Hippo+CMS+Home"&gt;Hippo&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.jahia.org/jahia/home.html"&gt;Jahia&lt;/a&gt; from this perspective. Recently, I have been playing around with the &lt;a href="http://dev.day.com/microsling/content/blogs/cup.c.html"&gt;JCR Cup distribution&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="http://www.day.com/content/site/en/index/products/content-centric_infrastructure/content_repository.html"&gt;Day's CRX&lt;/a&gt; that bundles &lt;a href="http://incubator.apache.org/sling/site/index.html"&gt;Apache Sling&lt;/a&gt; (very cool!). Commercial, back-end focused products like &lt;a href="http://www.percussion.com/"&gt;Percussion Rhythmyx&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.refreshsoftware.com/SR2"&gt;Refresh Software SR2&lt;/a&gt; certainly play in this area. People used to deploy &lt;a href="http://www.interwoven.com/components/pagenext.jsp?topic=PRODUCT::TEAMSITE"&gt;Interwoven Teamsite&lt;/a&gt; for this but I think it is too expensive to be used in this way. &lt;a href="http://www.bricolage.cc"&gt;Bricolage&lt;/a&gt; is an open source back-end only WCM product written in Perl. But &lt;a href="http://blog.contenthere.net/2006/12/area-architect-dreams-of-model.html"&gt;accurate preview and content staging can be complicated in decoupled architectures&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="http://drupal.org"&gt;Drupal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://plone.org"&gt;Plone&lt;/a&gt; are also quite popular as content centric frameworks for building applications but they tend to dominate the overall architecture (unless you use Plone with &lt;a href="http://www.enfoldsystems.com/Products/Entransit"&gt;Enfold Entransit&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have plenty of options that will allow you to avoid brewing your own content management functionality. Consider them!</content>

    <title>Alfresco web content management team moving on</title>
    <content type='html'>A few weeks ago I &lt;a href="http://blog.contenthere.net/2008/05/alfresco-and-e2cm.html"&gt;slid in a subtle mention&lt;/a&gt; that the &lt;a href="http://www.alfresco.com"&gt;Alfresco&lt;/a&gt; WCM team had some significant departures (I'll say who it was now: chief WCM architect Jon Cox, and lead programmer Britt Park).  Since then I have been wondering to myself how long the remaining WCM leadership (that is, Kevin Cochrane) would last.  Well, I don't need to wonder any more.  John Newton &lt;a href="http://newton.typepad.com/content/2008/06/kevin-cochrane.html"&gt;just announced on his blog&lt;/a&gt; that Kevin is leaving Alfresco to "to pursue other opportunities in the US."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kevin has been a very important member of the Alfresco team.  He fought hard to bring an understanding of the web to a bunch of &lt;a href="http://www.documentum.com"&gt;Documentum&lt;/a&gt; alumni (to Alfresco's credit they recognized WCM as their blind spot and invited him into fight that fight). His energy and experience was critical in product development and sales.  Alfresco's WCM offering has come so far since it was initially introduced.  Right now, many of its challenges stem from being stuck in an Enterprise Content Management user interface.  It may be that Kevin was running up against similar constraints.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess the next thing to wonder about is how Alfresco will backfill for the valuable role that Kevin played.  Hopefully they will bring in someone with similar wisdom and passion.  But that will be hard to do.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sure Kevin will have a similar (or even greater) impact in his new role wherever that may be.</content>

    <title>Yulup, Meet Yanel</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;While most WCM products and projects are focusing on AJAX technologies to deliver a better editing experience from a browser based interface, there are a couple of projects looking in other directions.  Yesterday, &lt;a href="http://www.wyona.com/"&gt;Wyona&lt;/a&gt; CEO and &lt;a href="http://lenya.apache.org/"&gt;Apache Lenya&lt;/a&gt; Founder, &lt;a href="http://www.wyona.com/people/michael-wechner/index.html"&gt;Michael Wechner&lt;/a&gt; showed me a new approach he is working on:  &lt;a href="http://www.yulup.org/"&gt;Yulup&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://yanel.wyona.org/"&gt;Yanel&lt;/a&gt;.  Yulup is a &lt;a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/"&gt;FireFox&lt;/a&gt; plugin that provides editing tools for web assets that have been Yulup enabled.  Yanel is a trimmed down CMS interface that Yulup can talk to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a user has Yulup installed, he sees a special icon on the top right of his browser.  This icon will indicate if a page is Yulup enabled.  If it is, the user will be able to execute actions like checkout, open, save, or whatever else is enabled at the server.  Yulup uses FireFox's WYSIWYG HTML editor or more sophisticated users can edit the HTML directly.  The demo that I saw had a static HTML website but I could see how this technology would be capable of handling more structured content.  Dialog boxes written in &lt;a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/xul/"&gt;XUL&lt;/a&gt; perform functions like repository browsing and file upload.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Behind the scenes some interesting architecture is at work.  Pages are enabled by adding an XML tag to the content.  This tag tells Yulup to ask Yanel for a resource file that tells what actions are enabled.  This resource file also maps actions to different URLs and methods.  In this way, different content management systems can perform library services such as checkout, check in, add, update, delete, etc.   &lt;a href="http://neutron.wyona.org/"&gt;Neutron&lt;/a&gt; is the protocol.  Michael expressed some regret about not using an existing protocol (Atom and WebDAV were considered) but these didn't have necessary features and it was unlikely that the Yanel/Yulup team would have enough sway to get them added.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is still early technology and there are some important features to add.  For example, the system needs a more sophisticated security model that limits the available actions &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;before&lt;/span&gt; login.  Also, details like how to implement versioning and workflow have not yet been fleshed out.  You can see the roadmap &lt;a href="http://www.yulup.org/en/roadmap/index.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  The long term vision is to Yulup-enable many different CMS and standardize the user interface similar to how the JCR hopes to standardize content storage.  As with technologies that threaten to disrupt the status quo, many projects may resist this attempt to hijack the interface and commoditize the CMS.  But if this UI works for users (especially users that need to work on different CMS) it may be hard to fight much in the same way that many writers want MS Word or Outlook to be the interface to their ECM systems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other project that is trying to create a universal user interface for content management systems is the &lt;a href="http://www.eclipse.org/apogee/"&gt;Apogee Project&lt;/a&gt;.  They are building content management services on top of the popular open source IDE (Integrated Development Environment) &lt;a href="http://www.eclipse.org/"&gt;Eclipse&lt;/a&gt;.  This project appears to have stalled.  I would give it low potential for survival because the project sponsor (Nuxeo) has its hands full porting CPS from Zope to Java and because Eclipse might be too techie for your average content editor.  Last I checked, Eclipse was a 100MB+ download and good luck using it if your screen resolution is less than 1600x1200.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Developers working on a rock-solid CMS with an ugly face (of course, no developer thinks his baby is ugly), may want to check this project out.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Mid-Market CMS</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;EContent Magazine recently &lt;a href="http://www.ecmag.net/Articles/ArticleReader.aspx?ArticleID=7506&amp;amp;CategoryID=5"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; the 7th edition of &lt;a href="http://www.cmswatch.com/"&gt;CMS Watch's&lt;/a&gt; CMS Report. According to the article, one of the big trends identified by the latest CMS Report is that the mid market of CMS products has really taken off.  I too have noticed an increase attention paid to mid-market CMS vendors and have attributed it largely to a rejection of the big vendor's push towards ECM. Clients that I have spoken to are starting to be suspicious of the ECM vision and monolithic architectures.  They are turning to targeted, best of breed solutions. These systems can be deployed with smaller initiatives that are more closely aligned with the needs of the users and enjoy a shorter time to benefit. There is also considerable interest in ASP solutions offered by CrownPeak and Atomz.  By the way, the same market forces that are helping out mid-market CMS products are also driving adoption of Open Source CMS products.  Clients are recognizing the practicality and benefits of a heterogeneous CMS infrastructure and are thinking of content integration strategies rather than ECM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to being less complicated and easier to use, targeted content management solutions are considerably cheaper than ECM products.  The evolution of mid-market ECM is going to be very interesting to watch. Some of these companies will be acquired by the major players. Others may turn into the next generation of ECM companies by filling out their functionality either through acquisition or organically.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are selecting a CMS, you should consider targeted solutions and actively manage the risk that is introduced by this market volatility. Plan an exit strategy as part of the selection. Look for open standards and interoperability that will make the solution substitutable, wholly or in part. Make sure that your content is does not get locked up in proprietary formats. Stick with technologies that you feel comfortable supporting. Spread your bets.  Your content will outlive any technology choice you make today.  Plan for it.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Book Review: Django 1.0 Template Development</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I just finished reading Scott Newman's book &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.packtpub.com/django-1.0-template-design-practical-guide/book"&gt;Django 1.0 Template Development&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.  This is the second  &lt;a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/"&gt;Django&lt;/a&gt; book that I have read (the first was &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1590597257?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=contenthere-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1590597257"&gt;The Definitive Guide to Django&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=contenthere-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1590597257" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/em&gt;) and I am very impressed by the number (and quality) of Django books that have been published.  21% of the respondents to a recent &lt;a href="http://thisweekindjango.com/twid/episode/50/this-week-django-50/"&gt;"This Week in Django" poll&lt;/a&gt; said that they learned Django from reading a book (65% learned from the online documentation).  Considering that until recently there were no Django books, this is significant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Django 1.0 Template Development&lt;/em&gt; lives up to its title by focusing on the template layer of the Django web application framework although it does go through some basics of setting up your project and some of the details of the Django request handling pipeline.  There is very little coverage of models - just enough to give the sample project some data to work with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is good coverage of how templates are loaded and guidelines of how to develop views [&lt;a href="#1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;] with plenty of tips on leveraging Django's many convenience features (like generic views) and organizing code for better manageability.  There are examples for using and writing custom middleware, filters, and tags [&lt;a href="#2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;] with special attention paid to best practices in security.  A whole chapter is devoted to working with Django's pagination system.  Explanations are well supported with the theory behind and examples that demonstrate the details of Django's behavior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The area that I was hoping for a little more depth was in optimizing performance.  Django gives the developer a lot of options of how to design the application.  For example, in addition to the typical template "include" syntax, Django also supports template inheritance (where a child template can extend and override blocks of a page from its parent).  There is not much information on the performance implications of deep template hierarchies.  The caching chapter gives a nice overview of Django's different caching options and engines and general guidelines but perhaps the art of really tuning a site is the topic for another book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would highly recommend &lt;em&gt;Django 1.0 Template Development&lt;/em&gt; for anyone who wants to efficiently build a clean and manageable template layer for a Django project.  In particular, a developer who needs to make the display tier flexible and extensible (such as the book's example of managing a separate site skin for mobile browsers).  Although the preface recommends the reader have a working knowledge of Django and Python, I don't think that is really necessary.  There is just enough information to help the developer to understand the overall Django framework but the emphasis is definitely on displaying data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Notes:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a name="1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; in Django, the "view" is the code that gathers and preprocesses the data for the template to render&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a name="2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; These are important for a template developer because Django deliberately limits the amount of logic you can put into a template to force developers to keep templates clean and make code more reusable.  Logic belongs in filters (that manipulate data) and tags (that do more complex logic), and middleware (where you inject additional functionality into the request/ response cycle).&lt;/ul&gt;</content>

    <title>Now THAT is a Domain!</title>
    <content type='html'>I was Skyping with someone a couple of days ago and he was referring me to a URL that he decided it would be better to type.  One reason was it was not in English and I have no foreign language skills.  The other reason was the URL was &lt;a href="http://www.maatschappelijkverantwoordondernemen.be"&gt;http://www.maatschappelijkverantwoordondernemen.be&lt;/a&gt;.  Now &lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;that&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is a URL.   I recently saw a presentation by David Esrati from &lt;a href="http://www.thenextwave.biz"&gt;The Next Wave&lt;/a&gt; where he talked about his &lt;a href="http://www.thenextwave.biz/tnw/?p=333"&gt;80-40 Rule&lt;/a&gt;.  The basic idea is that URLs are less important because 80% of browsing starts in the search box.  40% of users are so clueless that they type the URL in the search box.  If this is true, having an awkward domain name is not so much of a problem.  Social bookmarking and blogs probably help too.  But I assume that there are &lt;a href="http://www.onedegree.ca/2007/03/15/clownpenisfart-snl-proves-domains-matter"&gt;limits to acceptable awkwardness&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, kudos to J Rulnick for having the foresight to register &lt;a href="http://ww.w.chargoggagoggmanchauggagoggchaubunagungamaugg.com"&gt;chargoggagoggmanchauggagoggchaubunagungamaugg.com&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Chaubunagungamaug"&gt;longest place name&lt;/a&gt; in the United States!  He gets the 80-40 rule!  I think?</content>

    <title>SDL International to Acquire Tridion</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://www.sdl.com"&gt;SDL International&lt;/a&gt; just &lt;a href="http://www.sdl.com/company/press-releases-archive-2007-sdl/press-release-sdl.htm?id=1140"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that they will acquire &lt;a href="http://www.tridion.com/"&gt;Tridion&lt;/a&gt;.  This is very interesting news because The Netherlands based Tridion seems poised to make quite an impact on the North American mid level WCM market.  They have just started to aggressively market in the States and the product is already popping up on selection short lists that typically include &lt;a href="http://www.ektron.com"&gt;Ektron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://sitecore.com/"&gt;SiteCore&lt;/a&gt;.  SDL is a combination software/services company focused on global information management.  Not long ago, they acquired Trados.</content>

    <title>Magnolia Publishes Roadmap, Loses Reference Site</title>
    <content type='html'>The &lt;a href="http://www.magnolia.info/en/magnolia.html"&gt;Magnolia International&lt;/a&gt; team has been at work charting out their roadmap and increasing their transparency by publishing their plans on their &lt;a href="http://wiki.magnolia.info"&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt; and stepping up their blogging (&lt;a href="http://betterfasterbigger.blogspot.com/"&gt;Boris&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://philipp-bracher-magnolia.blogspot.com"&gt;Philipp&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://wiki.magnolia.info/pages/recentlyupdated.action?key=~gjoseph"&gt;Gregory&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to the &lt;a href="http://wiki.magnolia.info/display/DEV/Roadmap"&gt;roadmap&lt;/a&gt;, the upcoming version &lt;a href="http://wiki.magnolia.info/display/DEV/Roadmap+3.6"&gt;3.6&lt;/a&gt; (due out in June) will have mainly infrastructural improvements with better integration with JSF and Spring and enhanced caching and clustering.  Feature-wise, the biggest changes will be an improved import/export system for backups.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a user's perspective, the biggest changes will come from a special project called &lt;a href="http://wiki.magnolia.info/display/DEV/Genuine+Overview"&gt;Genuine&lt;/a&gt; that will revamp the administration and content contribution user interface ("Admin Central").  Genuine started with a &lt;a href="http://wiki.magnolia.info/display/DEV/Genuine+Analysis"&gt;critique of the current UI&lt;/a&gt; which lead into an initiative to improve Admin Central's usability and extensibility.  The project appears to be at a conceptual stage with few commitments on milestones or other details.  The ideas driving the project are best summarized in the &lt;a href="http://wiki.magnolia.info/download/attachments/8159235/Genuine+Concept+Presentation+2008-02-07.pdf?version=1"&gt;Concept Presentation slide deck&lt;/a&gt;.  Magnolia's usability is generally regarded as being quite good.  That they are able to critically look at their own work for ways to improve shows their drive.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In other (totally unrelated) Magnolia news, &lt;a href="http://drupal.org"&gt;Drupal's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.buytaert.net/france24-using-drupal"&gt;Dries Buytaert reports that France24 is now running on Drupal&lt;/a&gt;.   &lt;a href="http://www.france24.com/en/"&gt;France24&lt;/a&gt;, France's answer to CNN, used to be a high profile Magnolia site.  Dries doesn't know the circumstances of the migration.  Personally, I think that Drupal is a better functional fit for media and publishing oriented sites than Magnolia because of how Drupal structures and organizes content.  Magnolia content is typed at the "paragraph level" rather than at the asset level and is organized in a rigid hierarchical structure.  Drupal content is typed at the asset (or node) level and is organized by keywords (called vocabularies).  This makes it easier for articles to surface on multiple pages for a richer, faceted browsing experience (with more ad impressions).  Drupal is turning into a popular choice for the media and publishing industry. For example &lt;a href="http://www.theonion.com/content/index"&gt;The Onion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.motogp.com/"&gt;MotoGP&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/"&gt;Fast Company&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.mylifetime.com/"&gt;Lifetime&lt;/a&gt; all run on Drupal.  There is also a nice little &lt;a href="http://vimeo.com/979664"&gt;video showing all the newspapers running Drupal&lt;/a&gt;.  Magnolia, on the other hand, is better for corporate internet and intranet sites where site authors like tight control over the organization and display of the content.</content>

    <title>WCM needs a new name. Or, perhaps, an old one.</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;This post was originally written as a comment on Jon Mark's excellent post &lt;a href="http://jonontech.com/2009/12/16/visions-of-jon-wcm-is-for-losers/"&gt;Visions of Jon: WCM is for Losers&lt;/a&gt; but it got out of hand and I suspect that it is too long for a comment so I am re publishing it here.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for the great post Jon!  I have to agree with you that the term Web Content Management System is misleading because of its diverse focus on multiple publishing channels.  You probably remember that in the old days (~1996), the term "CMS" was first used to describe products like Vignette and what are now called ECM systems were just called Document Management Systems, Records Management Systems, etc.  When the big DMS vendors started to covet the term "content," the (then) smaller WCM vendors had to slide over a bit and qualify their category with a "W." Then some of them started to ruin themselves by trying to expand into document, management, records management, etc. - but that's another story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;But enough about the Ghosts of Christmas Past...  I agree with the point that a WCMS has multiple aspects.  I would name three: a management tier to edit semi-structured content, a repository to store the semi-structured content, and a rendering tier to render the content.  Usually the repository is more tightly coupled to the management tier so it is often tucked into the management application.  In fact, &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2006/12/area-architect-dreams-of-model-architecture.html" title="coupled architectures"&gt;the three components are often bundled for convenience.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my mind, what sets WCM apart from the other forms of CMS is the C.  I still think of Content as having more structure (and less embedded formatting) than what you typically find in an ECM repository.  In the ECM world, the structured information is called metadata and is not considered part of the asset (a MS Office file that jumbles together information and presentation).  A WCM asset needs to be rendered (given a format) to be useful to a consumer.  This is why a WCMS needs a good rendering system.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most ECM assets can just be downloaded but the range of formats they can take is limited.  You can get a different file format (like a PDF) or a different scaling or cropping of an image but the output looks essentially the same.  ECM has tricks to add structured information like metadata and embedded tags but that is going against the grain.  WCM, which is inherently structured, knows what each of the different elements of an asset mean.  I like to say that &lt;em&gt;ECM is documents pretending to be content and WCM is content pretending to be documents&lt;/em&gt;.  That is, ECM starts with a document and tries to pull information out of it while a WCM starts with structured information and renders it into a .html, .pdf, .xml, or any other kind of document. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, at the end of it all, I would say that WCM should be renamed back to CM and ECM should be renamed to EDM: Enterprise Document Management. &lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Another tough year for personalization</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;While I generally &lt;a href-"http://www.contenthere.net/2010/12/11-content-management-wishes-for-2011.html"&gt;don't enjoy 2011 prediction posts&lt;/a&gt;, I really loved James Hoskins's article &lt;a href="http://2020visions.wordpress.com/2010/12/23/2011-through-my-lens/"&gt;(20)11 predictions from the CMS coal face&lt;/a&gt;.  I found it thoughtful, pragmatic, and meaningful.  One of my favorite predictions is #8 Personalisation falters again.  I have had &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2009/12/are-content-managers-ready-for-personalization.html"&gt;similar challenges with personalization&lt;/a&gt;.  Most content organizations do not have the maturity, discipline, and energy to fully leverage this kind of technology.  Interest and investment inevitably subsides after irrational expectations are not immediately gratified.  Investment is higher than expected: you have to manage more complex technology, you need to develop more content, and you need to test a lot more.  Return is lower than expected: most companies don't even know how to measure the value of the return.&lt;br/&gt;There are, of course, exceptions. The importance of display and placement are ingrained in retail culture (online and offline) and small tweaks can lead to big returns.  Customer extranets are inherently personalized so I am not including that here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditional media companies (magazines, newspapers, and television/radio stations) would like to personalize but they don't have quite the upside eCommerce sites do; on a media site, an extra click means a few more ad impressions rather than a potential sale.  Most media clients find that the volume and turnover in content makes the cost of tuning personalization greater than the return.  Showing articles that are related to the current article brings the biggest bang for the buck.  Marketing sites are more campaign driven than personalized; you put up different pages with different URLs rather than creating a personalized user experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As problematic as it has been in the past, I think that succeeding with personalization is only going to get harder.  First of all, multiple device support is going to eat up your development resources so you will have even less time to test and tune complex personalized views.  Second, unless you are lucky enough to be one of the premier social networking sites, most of your audience will only be on your site for a page or two &amp;mdash; if at all.  Most visitors will follow a deep link to your site, scan the content, then go back to the conversation about it.  Some visitors will take snapshot of the page using a service like &lt;a href="http://readitlaterlist.com/"&gt;Read It Later&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.instapaper.com/"&gt;Instaper&lt;/a&gt;.  Some visitors will just read the conversation and never click through.  The upshot is that most visitors will not hang around long enough to implicitly or explicitly build a profile that can drive personalization logic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think that the greatest potential for personalization will be to use a service like &lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2010/04/22/levis-facebook"&gt;Facebook Connect like Levis is doing&lt;/a&gt;.  When a visitor comes with Facebook Connect, they bring some additional context that can be used to drive personalization logic.  Most web savvy people find Facebook Connect creepy (and &lt;a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/ejpepffjfmamnambagiibghpglaidiec"&gt;will try to avoid it&lt;/a&gt;) but the vast majority of web surfers are either unaware or unconcerned with privacy issues.  I would look for a major uptake of Facebook Connect.  In particular, I expect to see recommended content display components that can be used in different presentation channels.  In the near term, however, I the greatest returns will come from the "&lt;a href="http://www.clickability.com/news/blog/Every_page_a_homepage.html"&gt;make every page a home page strategy&lt;/a&gt;" where each page promotes content that is related to the current page.  That's not personalization.  That's just good content re-use.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>optaros.com on eZ Publish</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;As is the case with most internal projects when staff utilization on client work is through the roof, our project to deploy www.optaros.com on eZ publish seemed to go on forever.  But, thanks to some really dedicated individuals, we finally got the project over the line and we are &lt;a href="http://www.optaros.com"&gt;live&lt;/a&gt;.  With our first CMS based release of www.optaros.com[&lt;a href="#1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;], the retail view of the site does not change at all except for URL changes (except if you are a German speaker in which case you will be thrilled to know that the whole site &lt;a href="http://www.optaros.com/de"&gt;is translated into your favorite language&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being an internal project, a lot of people were involved during short bursts.  I think in general, they found the eZ publish syntax easy to pick up given enough examples.  Our business users had no trouble learning the user interface.  Other features we like include easily configurable content classes (through the UI, you can create custom content classes) which we use heavily.  Among the content classes we created were Partner Company, Person, Case Study, Promo, Career, and White Paper.  This allows us to surface different pieces of content throughout the site with different views.  For example, the same Person class is used to contain the information &lt;a href="http://www.optaros.com/en/company/leadership_team#Gottlieb"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href="http://www.optaros.com/en/publications/white_papers_reports"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  Localization and Versioning are excellent.  Also eZ publish has a nice way to handle multiple sites including different language translations of the same site or totally different sites.   We could have done a domain based mapping (i.e. http://www.optaros.de rather thand http://www.optaros.com/de) but we decided against it for various reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One thing to be aware of when deploying an eZ publish site.  Performance.  Don't let the "PHP" fool you.  eZ publish does a lot of work on the rendering side.  If you look at the code, you can kind of guess why.  There are lots of includes and text transformations.  For example, when you have an HTML text area, it is really stored in XML so there is a view of that field that you have to invoke to render the XML as HTML.  From an architectural perspective this is very nice.  It means that you could override this view for a different device such as a PDA.  However, if you want to host on really really cheap hardware (such as a virtual host with 256MB of RAM), this level of abstraction is costly on limited server resources.  eZ publish has lots of tuning parameters.  Some of the best documentation is on the eZ publish forum &lt;a href="http://ez.no/community/forum/setup_design/improving_ez_publish_environment_and_performance"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://ez.no/community/forum/general/ez_publish_performance_optimisation_faq"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.   You definitely need a PHP accelerator such as &lt;a href="http://eaccelerator.net/"&gt;eAccelerator&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://pecl.php.net/package/APC"&gt;APC&lt;/a&gt;.  You should configure template, view, and, if necessary, static caches.  Still, hosting a dynamic ("fried", not "baked" as &lt;a href="http://www.cmswatch.com"&gt;Tony Byrne&lt;/a&gt; would say) on really weak hardware is ambitious no matter what technology you are using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, eZ publish was a good choice for this site.  It might be for your as well but it all depends on your users.  eZ publish does not have an in-site editing model.  That is, there is a distinct back end for managing content and a front end for viewing content.  This made sense to our users.  They were able to map pages they saw on the "retail" side with the page tree on the management side.  However, I have seen business users who want to edit the content that they see on the fron end right there.  Some of the other CMS that do this nicely are: TYPO3, Lenya, Plone, and Joomla. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name="1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;: I know you are asking yourself, how could a company that Seth Gottlieb works for not have a Web CMS?  Here are the answers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Most of the poeple in the company know HTML and source control.  Our marketing person could usually find someone to make a text change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We do all the formatting in CSS.  This allows us to make a formatting change in one place and have it reflected all over the site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We like to experiment with the design a lot.  It is easier for a creative developer that can cut HTML code faster than you can use a word processor to work in static HTML than presentation templates.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;But now times are changing. We are around 60 people now and growing rapidly.  Our marketing department needs direct control over the website without being dependent on consulting resources.  We are publishing our site in multiple languages (French is coming out soon).  We get all that from eZ publish.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Content Modeling: People Names</title>
    <content type='html'>My general advice for content modeling is to structure things as much you can without annoying your editors.  More structure means more re-usability because presentation templates have more control over what to put where.  A good example is names of people.  If you have one field for name, you can show the name in alternative ways (such as "Joe Smith" and "Smith, Joe") and you can't do things like sort by last name.  It's better to put this information into two fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, you ask, what do you do when a person has one name as in Pink, Madonna, or Unknown?  If you have a person with one name, use the last name field.  Otherwise, when you sort by last name and then first name, all the one-namers come to the top.  This actually came up on two different projects in the last 6 months so I figured I would pass it on.</content>

    <title>Hints of change at Alfresco</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I am beginning to see hints at serious changes happening within &lt;a href="http://www.alfresco.com"&gt;Alfresco&lt;/a&gt;.  Historically the company has essentially operated as a commercial software company with a closed development model (that is, an internal opaque development team) and an open source version that was treated like shareware ("start using it and, if you like it, pay for the real product.").  Gradually, Alfresco has been opening up to be more transparent and developer friendly.  For example, now you can get the source of the Enterprise Edition.  You just need to pay an annual subscription to use the compiled version if you want to get support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent blog posts by Matt Asay (Alfresco's VP of Business Development) and John Newton (CTO) make me think there is more change to come.  First, in April Matt wrote this post on how the (very permissive) &lt;a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13505_3-10229817-16.html?tag=col1;post-4129"&gt;Apache Software License is better than the GPL&lt;/a&gt;.  That had me scratching my head because Alfresco uses the GPL license which is very strong at protecting IP.  Alfresco had already loosened up a bit by providing a "FLOSS Exception" where a developer working on another project with another OSI approved license can incorporate Alfresco under that license.  But the full Apache Software License goes much further.  If Alfresco was Apache licensed, Oracle could embed Alfresco in one of their commercial software products for free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then John Newton wrote a post talking about the &lt;a href="http://newton.typepad.com/content/2009/07/professional-open-source-software.html"&gt;virtues of professional open source and described Alfresco as a company that made money entirely from support&lt;/a&gt;.  At the time, I didn't really believe him because the terms felt like you needed to pay to use supportable software rather than pay for the support itself.  I know this is a minor distinction but a support contract seems easier to walk away from than an annual subscription to use software.  Still, I guess it would be possible to downgrade to a version of the Enterprise Edition that you compiled yourself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13505_3-10394478-16.html?part=rss&amp;tag=feed&amp;subj=TheOpenRoad"&gt;More recently, Matt comes up with this article that is critical of "fauxpen source:"&lt;/a&gt; products that come out of a closed development process but are distributed under an open source license.  He writes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;In the future, I think we'll see this "fauxpen-ness" fade as companies clearly separate their open-source efforts from their revenue models. Open source can provide a platform for monetization, but it isn't the best way to actually generate cash. Not for most companies, anyway. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I take this to mean that software companies will start to leverage the open source development model and get their revenue from sources other than renting out the IP of the software.  Matt doesn't mention &lt;a href="http://www.day.com"&gt;Day Software&lt;/a&gt; but that is clearly what Day is doing.  Day sells commercial software products (CQ5 and the CRX) but heavily invests in components (&lt;a href="http://jackrabbit.apache.org/"&gt;JackRabbit&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://sling.apache.org/site/index.html"&gt;Sling&lt;/a&gt;) that they have donated to the Apache Software foundation for open development.  They use these Apache components in their products and encourage their competitors to do so too.  Similarly, IBM invests in lots of Apache projects and Eclipse.  Ex-Alfrescan Kevin Cochrane now works at Day and I am wondering if he is convincing his former co-workers on this strategy.  I wonder if, now that there is a sufficient developer community, Alfresco will start to put development of some of their components (like their CIFS implementation or their Surf framework) out in the open where more people can contribute to it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If this &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; what is happening, (and now I am really speculating) it could mean one of two things.  One, Alfresco has reached a size and level of profitability that it can afford to let go of some immediate revenue to fuel some longer term growth.  Two, Alfresco is less focused on creating a company with a tight grip on IP that it can quickly sell.  Either way, I am very interested in how this plays out and will be watching for Alfresco components being released into an active development community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclosure&lt;/strong&gt; I do not have any inside information on Alfresco and am speculating based on what I read on the web.  I may be (and probably am) totally wrong.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Site Registration</title>
    <content type='html'>I was very happy to read Marc Osofsky's &lt;a href="http://www.imediaconnection.com/content/16444.asp"&gt;very well reasoned and well written article&lt;/a&gt; about setting content free.  In the early days at a company that I used to work at ;) we had a simmering debate about whether or not to require registrations to gain access to our white papers.  As you might expect, the consultants (who joined the company because they got the concepts behind open source software and Web 2.0 and also wrote the white papers) wanted to make the white papers freely available.  The sales organization, whose business process centered around processing leads, couldn't see the logic of not getting contact information whenever possible.  For a long time the company had a required registration and our sales guys made qualification calls to "Superman" and "Mickey Mouse." Hey, a lead is a lead.  Right?  Actually, the sales guys did get frustrated as you can tell from this &lt;a href="http://www.edsupport.cc/mguhlin/archives/2007/01/entry_2582.htm"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Web 1.0 expanded markets by allowing traditional business models and practices to be less geographically constrained.  With Web 2.0, communication has surpassed the point where it can be directly and centrally controlled.  By producing good content, companies are able to extend their reach beyond the realm that they can actively participate in.   People download things, try them out, blog about them, and talk about them in public and internal forums (physical and digital).   If they like what you have to say and have problem that you can solve, they will find you.  Maybe 1 in 10,000 contact you.  That is pretty good if you are reaching millions.  Furthermore, the 1 person that calls has already spent a lot of time pre-qualifying himself saving you a lot of work.  A great example is all the companies that put their product videos on YouTube.  I am seeing more software companies making their documentation available but there is a concern that their competitors will have access (as if they don't already).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All this doesn't mean that you can forget all of your traditional prospecting work.  That is, unless you have an amazing product that just sells itself.  You need to keep a balance.  Keep your sales guys getting their leads and working on them.  Just don't constrain the power of your published information by controlling it with a pre-web mindset.</content>

I was thinking of doing the same thing for &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net"&gt;Content Here&lt;/a&gt; but then I started to wonder "would I &lt;em&gt;Like&lt;/em&gt; Content Here?"  Don't get me wrong.  I &lt;em&gt;LOVE&lt;/em&gt; writing this blog and I also find the posts tremendously useful as a resource.  Re-reading old posts is a great way for me to recreate an idea that I once had in my head or re-use an explanation for one of my clients.  Sometimes I catch myself sending link after link to a client.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So while I LOVE this blog, I am not sure that I LIKE it &amp;mdash; at least not in a Facebook kinda way.  I guess it all boils down to how I use Facebook: &lt;a href="http://www.sethgottlieb.com/friend_policy"&gt;I use it for purely social purposes&lt;/a&gt;.  I keep strict separation between my Facebook world (where I connect with friends and family, many of whom are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; technical) and my professional (Twitter and LinkedIn) world.  Some contacts span both worlds &amp;mdash; mainly people who I know professionally but also hang out with outside of work.  On Facebook, I don't post about anything work-related; just as I don't bore dinner guests with esoteric content management theory or programming stuff.  There I talk about things that many of my friends and I are passionate about or would find amusing. On Twitter and this blog, I write about things that I find interesting professionally.  I avoid personal subjects like my family, political views, and silly humor. I have a feeling that others either consciously or unconsciously maintain this kind of barrier.  How many people would want to confuse their non-technical mother-in-law and the rest of their social network by "liking" the post &lt;a href=" http://www.contenthere.net/2009/07/code-moves-forward-content-moves-backward.html"&gt;Code moves forward. Content moves backward&lt;/a&gt;?  Probably about as many people who want their boss to see their beach pictures which were taken on a sick day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This probably infuriates Facebook because they want to manage the full social graph &amp;mdash; not just half of it.  But I don't think they have a great answer for people like me.  Some of my friends are working around this issue by creating two Facebook accounts: one for business and one for social.  My good friend &lt;a href="http://www.cmswire.com/"&gt;Brice Dunwoodie&lt;/a&gt; has a Facebook profile called &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/b.dunwoodie"&gt;Brice Dunwoodie SMG&lt;/a&gt;  for his "semi-public self."  But this isn't really a good solution for Facebook because it fractures their social graph.  In order to pull these social and professional aspects together, Facebook would need to get really clever about its privacy and filtering settings which are already overly complicated and controversial.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Facebook can't have all the social graph, which half would they want?  Are they be satisfied with the social side of the social graph which they already dominate?  Or would they prefer the professional side (currently owned by LinkedIn)?  Historically, Facebook ad revenue has been low considering their huge traffic volumes.  This makes sense because general interest content (like news, entertainment, personal statuses, and other content that people might "like" in a Facebook kind of way) has notoriously low CPM rates; not like niche publications that have their audience in a buying state of mind and know what types of products they are interested in.  Facebook's bet seems to be that, through their social graph, they can improve the targeting problem for general interest content.  If they are successful, they will achieve that lucrative formula of high traffic volume AND high CPM.  If they are not successful, they will probably need to think of some other way to monetize that large but distracted audience.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Release notes: the most important documentation you will ever write</title>
    <content type='html'>One of my favorite high school teachers used to say "if you want to learn about the world, read the newspaper." This is great advice because, by updating you on what is happening now, newspaper articles expose you to places, people, and histories that you can dig into more with additional research.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I feel the same way about release notes. Let's face it, people don't read product manuals cover to cover any more than they do encyclopedias. You read a reference resource when you want to learn more about something that you are already aware of. In the product world, you read the manual when you are struggling to figure out how to use a feature. But what if you don't know a feature exists? That is where release notes come in.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you practice lean product development, your product should be constantly improving so there should be plenty of material to talk about in release notes. You should also have an engaged customer base that likes the product, wants to learn new ways to use it, and is excited to know what is coming next. Release notes are the ideal channel to educate these customers about product features and progress. So make your release notes good!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While they are not release notes in a classic sense (because they are not tied to individual releases) a good model to follow is the "What's new with Alexa" emails that Amazon Echo owners get. These emails are easy to read and have just enough information to tease the reader into trying something and learning more. They also mention older features that new users may not have heard about yet. In fact, I am convinced that some weeks those emails only contain older features. But they are still useful reminders!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The redesigned App Store for iOS 11 also has some of these qualities.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I pay a lot of attention to release notes for all of the products I manage. Here are some habits that I think make them successful.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write the first draft of the release notes at the start of a release cycle. That is, when the release is scoped and getting prepared for QA.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Invite internal stakeholders (especially sales, support, and QA) to review and comment on early release notes drafts. You might learn about functional issues that were not considered during the initial design. You may also learn about how to better describe/position the feature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make the release notes fun and easy to read. I find that humor are helpful in keeping the reader's attention.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make release notes required reading for staff. After sending out the release notes, I email managers a quiz question to ask their team.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep the notes short. Focus on what the change is and the problem it solves. Talking about the "why" is critical because it helps the reader understand what the feature is used for. For more details, link to longer form knowledge base articles or product documentation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Include a "new to you" section that describes a pre-existing feature that is under-utilized or not widely known about.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy the release notes into the Git merge commit message. This makes deployed versions stand out and searchable.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;</content>

    <title>Boston PHP User Group Meeting</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Last night &lt;a href="http://www.optaros.com"&gt;Optaros&lt;/a&gt; hosted the &lt;a href="http://www.bostonphp.org"&gt;Boston PHP Users&lt;/a&gt; group.  &lt;a href="http://www.zend.com"&gt;Zend&lt;/a&gt; provided the pizza.  &lt;a href="http://www.awprofessional.com/index.asp?rl=1"&gt;Addison Wesley&lt;/a&gt; pitched in door prizes. &lt;a href="http://www.ibm.com"&gt;IBM&lt;/a&gt; provided David Boloker, their CTO of Emerging Technology, who gave an excellent overview of IBM's interest and involvement in &lt;a href="http://www.php.net/"&gt;PHP&lt;/a&gt;.  He also brought along two colleagues from his engineering team (Adam and Brian - I didn't catch their last names) who showed demos of some PHP related projects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his talk, David discussed the concept of "Situational Applications" where a &lt;br /&gt;not-so-technical person could quickly put together an application to respond to an event or capitalize on an opportunity.  The technical skill was compared to a good spreadsheet programmer back in the old days (as in Lotus 1-2-3).  This analogy resonated with me as someone who used to build database reports in preparation for corporate management meetings.  The concept is the same, pull together all sorts of information and crunch it in different ways for decision support.  But now, the information can come from so many more sources including live data feeds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM sees PHP as a key to achieve this agility in application development.  PHP can serve as a malleable front end to back end systems through Web Services or RSS.  The demo used to make this point was of a project called QED Wiki, which is based on &lt;a href="http://www.wakkawiki.de/WakkaWiki"&gt;WakkaWiki&lt;/a&gt;.  In addition to being a regular Wiki, where you can add content, QED is an application development environment where you can script applications based on wiki content and external data.  The demo used a scenario of a major hardware store chain and how they can create situational applications based on weather conditions (sales depend on the weather conditions.  Hurricanes = tarps and plywood.  Snow = shovels and salt).  With a little bit of script, similar to writing spreadsheet functions, Adam was able to create a nice little application based on data from &lt;a href="http://www.nws.noaa.gov/"&gt;NOAA&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://maps.google.com"&gt;Google Maps&lt;/a&gt; showing the weather conditions of different stores within the chain.  I think it was a stretch when David said that a typical store manager could put something like this together, but I see the point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next demo was of a project to build a PHP plugin for &lt;a href="http://www.eclipse.org"&gt;Eclipse&lt;/a&gt;.  As someone who has to program in a different language every other project, I have grown to depend on an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for syntax hints.  The PHP plugin, while very early (according to Holoker, our group was among the first to see it), looks very useful.  It as all that you would expect:  code completion, debugging, navigation....  It was unclear how this fits in with &lt;a href="http://www.zend.com/store/products/zend-studio/"&gt;Zend Studio&lt;/a&gt; but Zend is collaborating on the project and has contributed its debugging technology.  If I had to guess, I would say that Zend Studio will eventually be based on Eclipse and Zend will sell value-add features such as remote debugging and code deployment.  The relationship between IBM and Zend was described as happy and productive with success stories like &lt;a href="http://www.zend.com/core/ibm/"&gt;Zend Core for IBM&lt;/a&gt; and this Eclipse initiative.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If any of you are in the Boston area on January 3rd, 2006, you should come over to  &lt;a href="http://www.optaros.com/company_contact.html"&gt;60 Canal Street&lt;/a&gt; to see &lt;a href="http://www.spacemonkeylabs.com/"&gt;Mitch Pirtle&lt;/a&gt; talk about &lt;a href="http://www.joomla.org"&gt;Joomla&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>One Field Job Application: Epilogue</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;A few people have been asking me about how my &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2012/08/an-unconventional-approach-to-recruiting.html"&gt;One Field Job Application experiment&lt;/a&gt; turned out (&lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2012/08/preliminary-results-from-the-one-field-job-application-experiment.html"&gt;preliminary results here&lt;/a&gt;).  We ended up hiring two excellent technical web PMs. &lt;a href="https://github.com/Tamakloe"&gt;Gerry Tamakloe&lt;/a&gt; works out of our Dublin Office.  Gerry is a powerhouse: helping teams get the most out of our systems.  He is not afraid to get into the details of an application and optimize it for an internal or external customer.  &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/katiemethe"&gt;Katie Methe&lt;/a&gt; works with me here in Massachusetts.  In addition to managing projects, Katie handles deployments, QA, troubleshooting of our websites and GMO applications.  I bombarded her with new stuff on her first day and she didn't even flinch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to finding some great people, this little experiment has reassured me that I am not unreasonable in expecting a web project manager to be capable of both managing people and doing technical tasks.  A web project manager should rise to, rather than shrink away from, a technical challenge.  Rather than just distributing work, A good web pm adds value to everything he/she touches: whether it be verifying and diagnosing a defect, deploying a fix, doing technical research, or configuring software.   &lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Drupal is to web development as Powerpoint is to design</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I was recently talking with a friend about how hard it is to find a good Drupal developer.  While Drupal is the &lt;a href="http://trends.builtwith.com/cms"&gt;second-most widely used CMS&lt;/a&gt;, finding developers who know how to work with it properly is really challenging. I think there are three reasons for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Drupal is so ubiquitous that most PHP developers have had at least some level of exposure to it.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;You can get a lot done in Drupal without knowing what you are doing.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Most of the people hiring Drupal developers are not able to evaluate the quality of the work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In thinking about this, an analogy came to mind:&lt;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Drupal is to web development as Powerpoint is to design.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PowerPoint is everywhere.  Anyone who knows a little bit of PowerPoint, and can search the web for images, can convince himself that he is an adequate designer (or at least a good visual communicator). But the more you care about design, the more horrifying these amateur presentations are.  PowerPoint itself isn't bad.  If you do have good design skills, PowerPoint can be an incredibly powerful design tool. But there are more bad designers working in PowerPoint than good designers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly,  Drupal has a huge library of modules that you can install and configure about as quickly as you can drop an image onto a slide.  An expert Drupal developer will know what modules to use, have good judgement of when to use them, and have a solid process for testing and managing configurations.  A Drupal amateur is unaware when he is creating a mess that is going to create embarrassing situations in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how do you separate the wheat from the chaff in the Drupal developer ecosystem? I tend to focus on three areas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The types of sites the developer worked on.  Wrong answer: "I build Drupal sites all the time."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How the developer finds modules to use.  Wrong answer: "I just search for them."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How the developer manages configurations across environments.  Wrong answer: "I just click boxes."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By asking these three questions, I can usually get an idea of expertise and craft that a Drupal developer applies to his work.  Happy hunting!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Oxite, Microsoft&amp;#39;s open source web content management system</title>
    <content type='html'>Janus Boye has blog post describing &lt;a href="http://www.jboye.com/blogpost/microsoft-open-source-web-cms/"&gt;a new web content management system from Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;.  Janus reports that the intent is to make a simple web publishing platform which is more suitable for external websites than its flagship MOSS2007 offering.  The most notable aspect of the Oxite is not its functionality or its positioning, it is its license.  Oxite is distributed under an &lt;a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/ms-rl.html"&gt;OSI certified license&lt;/a&gt;: the &lt;a href="http://www.codeplex.com/oxite/license"&gt;Microsoft Public License&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From poking around a bit, Oxite seems to be a project introduced by some MSDN developers who needed a platform on which to build &lt;a href="http://visitmix.com/"&gt;MIX Online&lt;/a&gt; (Microsoft's big developer conference.  Here is their &lt;a href="http://visitmix.com/lab/oxite"&gt;description of Oxite&lt;/a&gt;).  We all know that Microsoft's mainstream content management offerings would not be up to the task for this kind of open community site.  I am guessing that the code was first released under the auspices of developer network education and code sharing.  I am not sure if Microsoft has any business model behind the project other than to keep .NET developers happily buying Visual Studio.  Still, the Microsoft developer community is huge and I could see them hungry to participate in a community project that would be an answer PHP projects like &lt;a href="http://drupal.org"&gt;Drupal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://wordpress.org"&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;a href="http://www.codeplex.com/oxite"&gt;The code is hosted on CodePlex&lt;/a&gt; (Microsoft's version of Source Forge) and there are already 2,324 downloads since its December 5 release.</content>

    <title>Bakers and Chefs</title>
    <content type='html'>A couple of days ago, when presenting to a client, I started to talk about different types of users and analogy popped into my head.  It seemed to resonate with the group so I thought I would share it.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find there are two high level approaches that people take when using software: to methodologically follow steps, or to play around with it until you get the results that you want.  People tend to gravitate to one or the other.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People who like to follow steps use software like they are &lt;em&gt;baking a cake&lt;/em&gt;.  When you bake a cake, the ingredients combine to create complex chemical reactions that you have no hope of understanding.  The best you can do is religiously follow the steps and hope for the results that are promised.  (Or at least that is how most people bake cakes.  I am sure that expert bakers are different.)  For many, that is what using technology is like.  &lt;em&gt;Cooking&lt;/em&gt;, for most of us, is a far more experimental exercise.  You can follow portions of the recipe and improvise the rest.  You can add flavors until you get what you want.  If it starts to taste bad, you can usually bring it back to edible by adding a little of this or a little of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not to be age-ist, but millennials are often chefs.  They are comfortable enough with technology to improvise when completing a task or use a tool to do something completely new.  Digital natives aren't afraid they will "break the internet."  They won't read the documentation until they are stuck.  People who didn't grow up with software tend to be much more cautious and follow the directions.  They panic a little when something unexpected happens.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why does this matter?  It is important to user interface design when you have to serve these user populations.  For the bakers, step-by-step instructions built right into the UI help.  You also need to be very careful about consistency in naming conventions (just like the story of the user not being able to find the "any" key, a baker will tense up if the instructions talk about a "save" button but the button on the form says "submit").  For chefs, you need to do a lot more testing to ensure that unexpected uses don't mess things up.  Expect chefs to do a lot of trial and error.  If you know that they will not like the consequences of executing a function, warn them.  The classic case is warning a user that if they navigate away from the page, their work will be lost.  A baker wouldn't navigate away from the page unless the instructions told him to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I (and I think my audience) found it helpful to visualize a user carefully measuring their actions with a software application as if he is following a complicated cake recipe verses clicking around like he is throwing spices into a pot.  Maybe you will too.</content>

    <title>The J. Boye Short List</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Today J. Boye posted a &lt;a href="http://www.jboye.com/blogpost/who-should-be-on-your-cms-shortlist/"&gt;shortlist of vendors&lt;/a&gt; that "you should always consider" when selecting a web CMS.  While many will take issue about what products were included or excluded from the list, what surprises me the most is that they published such a list at all.  Here is why:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cmswatch.com/Analyst/8-Boye"&gt;J. Boye is very closely partnered with CMS Watch&lt;/a&gt;, which covers 42 products in its Web Content Management Report.  Putting out this list would seem to undercut CMS Watch's flagship product.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The CMS Watch messaging has always been that there is no "magic quadrant" in CMS and I would tend to agree.  J. Boye is the first reputable buy-side analyst to come out with one.  The title "Web CMS Shortlist 2009" suggests that they will come out with one every year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;J. Boye does a lot of CMS selection consulting.  This list implies that their selection services will start from these 10 products.  I think that undermines the value of their consulting services.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am sure that the J. Boye website will get a lot of traffic from this post and there will be a lot of angry comments from the vendors and open source projects excluded from the list.  Hey, all publicity is good publicity, right?  It is very interesting to see what J. Boye considers to be "go to" products and what is a global footprint.  But this list will not influence what products I consider during the CMS selections that I facilitate.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Migrating Content</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;There has been a great thread on the CM Professionals mailing list about automated tools for migrating content.  When the same topic was discussed a few months ago, the general consensus was that the hope of effortlessly migrating into a new CMS (either from an old CMS or a static site) is unrealistic.  A few people made the point that that limitation is not necessarily a bad thing because there is value in evaluating every piece of content as it is moved to the new site.  Slurping out of one website and spitting into another is likely to simply move the mess rather than achieve the goal of creating a more useful and manageable web resource.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dialog was re-energized today when a new member introduced himself as working for a company called &lt;a href="http://www.vamosa.com"&gt;Vamosa.&lt;/a&gt; Automated content migration is what they do.  The process that Vamosa practices is not a simple turn-key process.  That was reassuring because I know that if that is what he claimed, he would be lying.  A typical Vamosa project takes roughly 3-4 months.  It consists of measuring the gap between the state of the current content and the target system, creating rules for parsing content and mapping, then, once everything is set up to go, the system can migrate 10,000 pages per hour.  I assume that it takes several tries because that is my experience even for simple relational database migrations.    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This seems like an interesting service to look into.  Some legacy systems may be more suitable for this solution than others.  For example, if the target is highly structured, and the source has no structure and there is no uniformity of layout on which to base parsing rules, prospects would be dim.  However, if there is uniformity and structure, there would seem to be potential.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other posters in the dialog had ideas for other tools that would help in content migration.  For example, if Microsoft were to make a version of Word that was more of a content entry tool than a desktop publishing/layout tool, there might be hope that good structured, XML content could come of out of it.  I hear that &lt;a href="http://informationmapping.com/"&gt;Information Mapping's&lt;/a&gt; Content Mapper product does just that although I have not used it yet.  Another email talked about the need for tools to plan and manage the content migration process.  That sounds interesting too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Note:  If you are a CM Professional and saw a point that you made on the mailing list in this blog post and want attribution.  Please email me and I will quote and attribute.  I just kept it anonymous for privacy reasons&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Product Management Work Program</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;David Hobbs published a nice post describing &lt;a href="http://hobbsontech.com/content/product-managing-your-cms-defining-work-program"&gt;how to define a work program&lt;/a&gt; for managing your website.  The role of &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2009/04/website-product-manager.html"&gt;website product manager&lt;/a&gt; is near and dear to me.  In fact, in my &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/services/cms-selection"&gt;CMS Selection&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/services/content-management-assessment"&gt;Content Management Assessment&lt;/a&gt; projects, I get concerned about long term success if the client has not designated and empowered a strong product manager and a established a disciplined product management process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What I like about David's process model is that it shows the components of the process and how competing requirements work through that process.  The diagram is a nice visual for a product manager when receiving requirements and setting expectations.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Care and feeding</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Over the past couple of years, I have been seeing this recurring theme of companies redesigning their websites (internal and external) according to aspirations based other websites with a lot more content than they have.  During the design, stakeholders envision a user experience rich with information that is personalized and interrelated.  The problem is not so great with static websites because identification and production of content happens when the website is developed.  If the content does not exist, it is not in the design.  The presence of a CMS shifts responsibility for this content away from the project team (often consultants) and to the business users whose eyes are often larger than their bandwidth.  The time of this effort is pushed later - after the project budget has been spent.  The capability to change content can turn into a burden if the expectation of fresh content is communicated to the audience but effort was not budgeted for.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes no matter how much these facts are communicated, there is a level of disappointment when the site does not look like the mockup because the content is just not there or because of the extra workload that the "labor saving" CMS starts to impose.  At all costs, we need to avert this letdown.  Otherwise the project will not be considered a success even if the implementation was executed flawlessly.  Rather than talk at the abstract level, my recommendation is to point to very specific responsibilities and get commitment and ownership at design time.  Here are some good questions to ask when you hear stakeholders over-committing...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;"We want the site to have lots of graphs and charts."&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who in the organization has the tools, skills, and time to generate images?  Give them an assignment to create a weeks worth of images for dummy data and see if it gets done or if other tasks are delayed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;"We need the text to be in this special (non-standard) font.  It's our brand."&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This means that someone without graphics production capabilities will not be able to update the site.  You will now have the same bottleneck as you had with your static site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;"We only want to show relevant information to the visitor. Every page needs to be personalized."&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What do you show a visitor if you don't have anything relevant to show them?  How will content producers preview and QA the site if it will look different to everyone?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;"We want the site to look different every day with new and interesting content"&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who is going to make the site look different?  The potential to aggregate syndicated content will make this goal much easier to deliver on.  However, you might ask the question why it needs to look different every day.  It is unrealistic to want someone (who is not an employee) visit a corporate brochure site every day.  Those sites are generally designed to educate, not be a news source.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;"The reason why no one contributes content is that the system is so unusable"&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That may be the case.  One way to test this is to stand up a wiki (or if you have article based content, a blog or Drupal) as a temporary site to stage content for the new site.  Do everything you can to get people to contribute.  If something as simple as a wiki stands in the way of people contributing, maybe you have an organizational problem, not a technology problem.  This is especially the case for intranet based sites which have an alarming failure rate.  Very seldom are people rewarded for their intranet contributions like other job responsibilities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The big point here is that, in addition to making sure that your CMS is usable, you also need to think about manageability issues. Is the design something that can be maintained?  Is there enough value in the site to justify an ongoing investment in managing it?  Each category of content on the site must have an owner who is motivated (either because it is his job or his passion) to be responsible for the quality and usefulness of the content. Otherwise no amount of design or technology is going to lead to success.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Open Source CMS Article in EContent Magazine</title>
    <content type='html'>There is a good &lt;a href="http://www.econtentmag.com/Articles/ArticleReader.aspx?ArticleID=7620"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; on open source content management systems in the latest (January/February) issue of &lt;a href="http://www.econtentmag.com"&gt;EContent Magazine&lt;/a&gt;.  Here are some key points:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Frank Gilbane, of the Gilbane Report,  is quoted:  "If you have a spectrum where you build a CMS yourself on one end and commercial solutions at the other end, open source can sit in the middle."  I like this way of describing the role of open source CMS.  I think too often the focus is that open source is cheap content management.  The real potential of open source is that it provides commodity functionality that can serve as a foundation for building unique solutions.    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When considering an open source alternative, it is critical to evaluate the strength of the community.  This is the engine that will drive the evolution of the software and also a resource to get help in using or extending the software.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is growing interest in open source CMS as more and organizations look at open source as an alternative or complement to commercial technologies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</content>

    <title>Open Source version of Microsoft Content Management Server</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I just heard that &lt;a href="http://www.artemiscorp.com"&gt;Artemis Software&lt;/a&gt; is distributing an out-of-the-box integration of Microsoft Content Management Server called &lt;a href="http://www.mcmsrapid.com"&gt;MCMS.RAPID&lt;/a&gt; that is to be installed on top of MCMS 2002.  The interesting thing is that, MCMS.RAPID is an open source project.  Read the license &lt;a href="http://www.mcmsrapid.com/legal.htm"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  I was not able to find an announcement on Microsoft's website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The email announcement that I received made it seem like this was an Open Source CMS.  But in reality it is just a set of customizations that provide a higher starting point for an MCMS development project.  You still need to purchase the full MCMS product from Microsoft. I have heard criticism of MCMS for being very expensive to license.  This set of extensions might reduce the total cost of ownership and make MCMS a more attractive option.  Still, as I noted in another post, Microsoft does not seem to be paying much attention to this product so I would carefully consider purchasing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content>

    <title>Eckman on Social Computing in the Enterprise</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I just turned in the last of a rapid-fire succession of project deliverables and was catching up on reading John Eckman's great blog &lt;a href="http://www.openparenthesis.org"&gt;Open Parenthesis.&lt;/a&gt; John has a poignant series of posts about social computing in the Enterprise that I found myself silently nodding my head in agreement as I read. I share John's enthusiasm for the promise of &lt;a href="http://www.diso-project.org/"&gt;DiSo project&lt;/a&gt; and hope that one day one will be able to share a profile across communities on different social networking sites. What pushed me over the inertia to write my own post was John's entry called &lt;a href="http://www.openparenthesis.org/2007/12/20/workbook"&gt;Like Facebook, but without all the fun&lt;/a&gt; (I love the title. Reminds me of the &lt;a href="http://wordie.org/"&gt;Wordie&lt;/a&gt; tag line "Like Flickr, but without the photos). John is also critical of the notion that you can recreate a social network within a company and have it get all the personal interest of Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his post &lt;a href="http://www.cmswatch.com/Feature/171-Facebook"&gt;"Is Facebook in the Enterprise an Oxymoron?"&lt;/a&gt; Tony Byrne comes to a similar conclusion: "&lt;span style="font-family: arial;"&gt;But when does Facebook-behind-the-firewall stop being Facebook? I think the minute a central authority gets behind it -- and instinctively mandates some available MOBIG (Microsoft/Oracle/BEA/IBM/Google) software because it happened to be familiar or free -- is the minute the system will lose its appeal to rank-and-file employees.&lt;span style="font-family: Helvetica;"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am looking forward to seeing more creative ways to build on top of existing social networking platforms and personal tools like "My Yahoo" style consumer portals. &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/apis/opensocial/"&gt;OpenSocial&lt;/a&gt; looks interesting. So does the &lt;a href="http://dev.netvibes.com/"&gt;NetVibes API&lt;/a&gt;. What might be just as interesting is a potential shift in how large enterprise look at enterprise software for the knowledge worker and how they deploy and manage it. There used to be a larger focus on infrastructure and large projects to deploy massive enterprise software applications. What if enterprises start piggy-backing off of public infrastructure and change their focus to building high-impact tactical components and applications? It does seem risky to invest development dollars on a trendy service that you have no control over. But it can't be riskier than all those enterprise portal projects that wound up failing (note: CMS Watch &lt;a href="http://www.cmswatch.com/About/Press/200712Portals/"&gt;says that companies are getting better at deploying portals&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would love to hear of stories of companies that are building applications for themselves on consumer oriented infrastructure. The CMS Watch network is using Facebook to collaborate and coordinate and I have to say that I am underwhelmed. The old list serve worked much better than the Facebook group discussion boards because Facebook doesn't send you an email when someone adds a new topic or posts a reply to someone else's topic (if there is a setting to enable this, please let me know!). It &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; kind of fun to see people's pictures and what movie stars they resemble though! Maybe the recipe is to allow the public networks to bring the fun and interest and context that makes you want come back and add applications that are useful for people to do their jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content>

    <title>Feature Request: Expiring Scheduling Calendar Views</title>
    <content type='html'>Scheduling meetings is hard but it is a lot easier when all of the participants are on the same calendar server (Google Apps, Exchange, etc.). Despite all of the advances in calendaring, coordinating with participants in other companies hasn't gotten much easier in all the years I have been working.  Yes, there have been little victories here and there like &lt;a title="Doodle" href="http://doodle.com/"&gt;Doodle&lt;/a&gt; and Tungle (which looked promising until RIM bought it), but overall, we are still sending times when we are available and hoping we stay available.  This is an increasing problem as business relationships become more dynamic and less siloed by corporate boundaries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Google Apps has taken a step in the right direction by creating a free/busy view of your calendar that you can share.  But I don't love that option because that gives permanent access to that view.   It would be better to generate an expiring link that would give the user a view of the free/busy times for a few days (until the meeting is scheduled).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Google, Microsoft, anyone in the calendar software business - &lt;strong&gt;please steal this idea!&lt;/strong&gt;  Just don't patent it so that only one customer community benefits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;</content>

    <title>Mobile App Stores</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;As I have mentioned before, &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2012/09/apple-you-might-be-losing-me.html"&gt;Apple has done some things to shaken my loyalty&lt;/a&gt;.  I am at the point where my next phone will not be an automatic iPhone purchase.  I have friends and colleagues pitching alternatives pretty hard.  Out of curiosity, I looked up the availability of my favorite mobile apps on the &lt;a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store"&gt;Windows&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; App Stores.  Here is what I found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;tr&gt;&lt;br/&gt;		&lt;th&gt;App&lt;/th&gt;&lt;br/&gt;		&lt;th&gt;Android&lt;/th&gt;&lt;br/&gt;		&lt;th&gt;Windows Phone&lt;/th&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;tr&gt;&lt;br/&gt;		&lt;td&gt;Any Password Manager&lt;br/&gt;(like 1Password)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;br/&gt;		&lt;td&gt;Yes: &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lastpass.lpandroid&amp;feature=nav_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDMsImNvbS5sYXN0cGFzcy5scGFuZHJvaWQiXQ.."&gt;LastPass&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;br/&gt;		&lt;td&gt;Yes: &lt;a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/lastpass/9b86eadc-16e8-df11-9264-00237de2db9e"&gt;LastPass&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;tr&gt;&lt;br/&gt;		&lt;td&gt;Evernote&lt;/td&gt;&lt;br/&gt;		&lt;td&gt;Yes&lt;/td&gt;&lt;br/&gt;		&lt;td&gt;Yes&lt;/td&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;tr&gt;&lt;br/&gt;		&lt;td&gt;Google+&lt;/td&gt;&lt;br/&gt;		&lt;td&gt;Yes (duh)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;br/&gt;		&lt;td&gt;No (duh)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;tr&gt;&lt;br/&gt;		&lt;td&gt;Kindle&lt;/td&gt;&lt;br/&gt;		&lt;td&gt;Yes&lt;/td&gt;&lt;br/&gt;		&lt;td&gt;Yes&lt;/td&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;tr&gt;&lt;br/&gt;		&lt;td&gt;Any Exercise GPS&lt;br/&gt;(like Garmen)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;br/&gt;		&lt;td&gt;Yes: &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fitnesskeeper.runkeeper.pro&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImNvbS5maXRuZXNza2VlcGVyLnJ1bmtlZXBlci5wcm8iXQ.."&gt;RunKeeper&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;br/&gt;		&lt;td&gt;Yes: &lt;a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/mobifit/fcd76bfb-0027-e011-854c-00237de2db9e"&gt;Mobifit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;tr&gt;&lt;br/&gt;		&lt;td&gt;Mint&lt;/td&gt;&lt;br/&gt;		&lt;td&gt;Yes&lt;/td&gt;&lt;br/&gt;		&lt;td&gt;No&lt;/td&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;tr&gt;&lt;br/&gt;		&lt;td&gt;Movies &lt;br/&gt;(by Flixster)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;br/&gt;		&lt;td&gt;Yes&lt;/td&gt;&lt;br/&gt;		&lt;td&gt;Yes&lt;/td&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;tr&gt;&lt;br/&gt;		&lt;td&gt;Pocket&lt;br/&gt;			(or InstaPaper)&lt;br/&gt;		&lt;/td&gt;&lt;br/&gt;		&lt;td&gt;Yes&lt;/td&gt;&lt;br/&gt;		&lt;td&gt;Yes: &lt;a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/metropaper/36df9d6a-486c-4cb8-87b8-fccfffc7d432"&gt;MetroPaper&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;tr&gt;&lt;br/&gt;		&lt;td&gt;RememberTheMilk&lt;/td&gt;&lt;br/&gt;		&lt;td&gt;Yes&lt;/td&gt;&lt;br/&gt;		&lt;td&gt;Yes: &lt;a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/milkman/2d14a2ea-9445-4d46-b385-8b2e45f7f6d8"&gt;Milkman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;tr&gt;&lt;br/&gt;		&lt;td&gt;RSS Reader&lt;br/&gt;(with Google Reader Support)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;br/&gt;		&lt;td&gt;Yes: &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.reader&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImNvbS5nb29nbGUuYW5kcm9pZC5hcHBzLnJlYWRlciJd"&gt;Google Reader&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;br/&gt;		&lt;td&gt;Yes: &lt;a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/nextgen-reader/643381de-4724-e011-854c-00237de2db9e"&gt;nextgen Reader&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;br/&gt;		&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;tr&gt;&lt;br/&gt;		&lt;td&gt;ServerDensity&lt;/td&gt;&lt;br/&gt;		&lt;td&gt;Yes&lt;/td&gt;&lt;br/&gt;		&lt;td&gt;No&lt;/td&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;tr&gt;&lt;br/&gt;		&lt;td&gt;Any SSH Client&lt;/td&gt;&lt;br/&gt;		&lt;td&gt;Yes: lots&lt;/td&gt;&lt;br/&gt;		&lt;td&gt;Yes: &lt;a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/token2shell-wp/29a61c67-75b5-4e22-8875-6ac87ee8e0ef"&gt;Token2Shell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;tr&gt;&lt;br/&gt;		&lt;td&gt;Tripit&lt;/td&gt;&lt;br/&gt;		&lt;td&gt;Yes&lt;/td&gt;&lt;br/&gt;		&lt;td&gt;Yes&lt;/td&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;tr&gt;&lt;br/&gt;		&lt;td&gt;Twitter&lt;/td&gt;&lt;br/&gt;		&lt;td&gt;Yes&lt;/td&gt;&lt;br/&gt;		&lt;td&gt;Yes&lt;/td&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;tr&gt;&lt;br/&gt;		&lt;td&gt;Yelp&lt;/td&gt;&lt;br/&gt;		&lt;td&gt;Yes&lt;/td&gt;&lt;br/&gt;		&lt;td&gt;Yes&lt;/td&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;tr&gt;&lt;br/&gt;		&lt;td&gt;YouTube&lt;/td&gt;&lt;br/&gt;		&lt;td&gt;Yes (duh)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;br/&gt;		&lt;td&gt;Yes&lt;/td&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, I was surprised by the number of apps on the Windows Phone store.  The screen shots looked really nice too.  However, I think that the combination of Mac + Windows Phone would be challenging. If I was a Windows user, the Windows Phone would be a pretty attractive option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;One thing that I find limiting on the iPhone is that Safari is locked down and doesn't accept plugins. I assume that Android doesn't have this issue because it gives you different browser options.  Does Windows allow you to install mobile IE plugins/extensions?&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Good story about metadata capture</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Lars Plougman's story &lt;a href="http://www.mindthis.net/mindthis/2006/01/feeling_good_ab.html"&gt;about a lawyer's scheme to work around a document management system&lt;/a&gt; points out a huge issue in content management. The natural tension between creators and consumers of content. Content creators create content for their own purposes and don't like to spend the extra effort to add metadata that is only useful to other users and systems. In fact, I often distrust voluntary metadata because, as &lt;a href="http://contenthere.blogspot.com/2006/01/gsa-meta-data-not-essential-for-search.html"&gt;as I mention in an earlier post&lt;/a&gt;, users either neglect or abuse metadata. Consumers of content, however, benefit from good metadata because they allow readers to quickly identify content that is useful to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is interesting that the solution that Lars' story presents uses a third party intermediary to take the content and properly enter it into the system with the correct profile information. The more I think of it, the more I am thinking that this is a good idea and it actually maps to something that I do at Optaros.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We use &lt;a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/"&gt;Subversion&lt;/a&gt; as our source control system and have set up a SVN commits mailing list (more about that &lt;a href="http://contenthere.blogspot.com/2005/03/managing-projects-open-way.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). As I read the checkin emails, in addition to seeing what people check in, I can see who has been naughty and nice with their checkin comments (which are metadata!). If someone gets lazy with the comments, I give them a friendly reminder. Otherwise, it would not be until much later, when we need to roll back some code, that we would realize that the comments were not helpful (I know whoever is reading this is thankful that they don't work with me!). Usually just the knowledge that people are looking makes contributors more meticulous about their comments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The most common way to enforce metadata is through input validation (like in the case of the lawyer's document management system). Users hate it and that is the first thing people point to when they talk about how unusable their system is. It strikes me that making content creators write their own metadata is relatively new and maybe it doesn't work. Formal publishing environments typically have authors write stories and editors compose headlines and place stories. Lawyers are usually pampered with admin staff so they historically have been removed from the mechanics of creating documents and metadata (although that is changing). The librarian profession specializes in metadata and organization. Is it unrealistic to expect content creators to manage their own metadata? Or should we return to inserting metadata specialists into the process after content creation, either as police like me with my commits list, or as metadata editors like the secretary in Lars' story. Can we afford to do that? Can we afford not to?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am looking forward to seeing your comments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>The world&amp;#39;s worst WCMS</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I just read &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/proops/status/5416475167"&gt;Philippe "@proops" Parker's tweet&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;there's no "best" wcm, says @jarrodgingras, but is there a worst one? #fixwcm&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;My 140 character or less answer is "No" but I have more to say so I will elaborate here....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no worst WCMS.  In fact, I would go so far as to say that every WCMS is (or at least was) the best WCMS for someone.  The reason is this:  every WCMS product was built to someone's specifications.  Some WCMS development projects fail in their mission but we rarely see the products of those projects in the marketplace.  What we do see are the products that delivered so well on their specification that somebody had the bright idea to get into the business of repeating that success for other organizations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So every WCMS, at least at one point in its lifetime, was someone's best WCMS.  But software is not static.  It changes over time (at least it should) and it is quite possible that poor product management can make software worse.  I see that as a very real problem for many of the software products in the marketplace.  It takes discipline to avoid feature bloat that clutters the application and makes it less suitable for its best use.  Software companies that look to competitors and potential customers for guidance are more vulnerable than companies that listen to their customers who are already using the software.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a great philosophy in software product management called "&lt;a href="http://www.codesimplicity.com/post/suck-less/"&gt;Make it suck less&lt;/a&gt;."  The idea is that, rather than add new features to draw in new kinds of customers, make life better for people who already use your software.  That is, don't ruin the software by trying to please everyone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sadly few companies take this approach and, as a result, the race to make worse software has a bigger, more competitive field than the race to make better software.  Therefore, nobody is going to win the dubious distinction of the developer of the worst WCMS - its going to be a big tie.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>When building communities, don&amp;#39;t fall into the tool trap.</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Chris Grams has an &lt;a href="http://opensource.com/business/10/11/avoid-tool-trap-when-building-communities"&gt;excellent post reminding us to avoid the tool trap when forming a community&lt;/a&gt;.  That advice is so obvious yet so rarely practiced.  Building communities is hard work and the temptation to experiment with technology is a distraction &amp;mdash; a distraction so strong that it can obscure the fact that the community has no reason to exist.  No matter what platform, the community will inevitably fail if it doesn't have the necessary ingredients: people with passion and a common set of interests and goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technology can be an enabler but it can never be a driver.  A robust community will survive with bad technology.  I would say to &lt;em&gt;intentionally use bad tools when you start a community&lt;/em&gt;.  This approach will cause an unviable community to fail faster and save unnecessary investment.  If a community is starting to grow despite bad tools, then you know you really have something worth investing in.  By the way, if anyone wants to join my Julio Lugo fan club, fax me your fax number.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>If only Carl Sagan was alive to see this...</title>
    <content type='html'>The &lt;a href="http://www.google.com"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; blog &lt;a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/07/we-knew-web-was-big.html"&gt;posted that they passed the 1 Trillion pages milestone&lt;/a&gt;.  They go on to say that the web is actually infinite thanks to websites like online calendars with "next" buttons that go into the future indefinitely.  It makes my little corner of the web feel even smaller than usual.  Even "billions and billions" seems small.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I remember hearing somewhere that Google is better positioned than anyone to handle large volumes of pages because their indices use a unique proprietary database and storage technology that can scale far beyond traditional relational databases.  It looks like they are going to need it.</content>

    <title>eZ publish Wins Web Idol</title>
    <content type='html'>If you have been to a content management conference in the last year, you might have seen one of &lt;a href="http://www.cmswatch.com/Analyst/3-Byrne"&gt;Tony Byrne's&lt;/a&gt; 'CMS Idol' or 'Web Idol' competitions.  If you have, you know they are a nice excursion from the typical vendor expo.  If you haven't, the basic premise is similar to the &lt;a href="http://www.americanidol.com/"&gt;American Idol&lt;/a&gt; television program but instead of singing and dancing (thank goodness) the vendors do short 6 minute demos of their product.  Like the television show, there are three judges (I once played Randy, dawg) giving commentary but the audience decides. Tony used to do a regular conference session called something like 60 seconds with a vendor where he would ask questions from the audience.  That was good but this is even better because it is visual and fun. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Web Idol is also entertaining if you like rooting for the underdog because the big heavy weights of the industry rarely do well.  They try to do too much with their demos to show their breadth and, on any one feature, they are not necessarily better than a simpler product with a well defined niche and understanding of the problem that they are trying to solve.  Another factor is that the small players really gear up for these things while the big guys often don't even participate because the downside of losing is way worse than the upside of winning (people expect a product that costs 10 times as much to be better).  The arrogance that the "industry leaders" have doesn't help either. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Winning Web Idol does not so much mean that you have the best product (there is no best product) but it does indicate that you have connected with the audience and shown a solution that they can visualize using within their organization.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even with that disclaimer, I still think it is very cool that &lt;a href="http://ez.no"&gt;eZ publish&lt;/a&gt; beat out &lt;a href="http://www.fatwire.com/"&gt;FatWire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.sitecore.net/"&gt;SiteCore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.terminalfour.com/"&gt;Terminalfour&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.tridion.com/"&gt;Tridion&lt;/a&gt; to win &lt;a href="http://cmf2006.dk/web_idol"&gt;Web Idol&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="http://cmf2006.dk"&gt;cmf2006&lt;/a&gt; in Denmark last week.  This is not a &lt;a href="http://proicehockey.about.com/cs/history/a/miracle_on_ice.htm"&gt;1980 U.S. Olympic Hockey Team&lt;/a&gt; class upset although there are probably some people out there who think it is.  People who have not seen open source content management software frequently believe these products to be developed by programmers and for programmers with very poor usability.  Usability and simplicity are the key factors in Web Idol and the cmf2006 audience was clearly impressed.  So, kudos to the eZ team for a great set of demos and removing some of the fear, uncertainty and doubt about open source technologies.</content>

    <title>Alfresco and Facebook</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Many open source software projects have started to experiment with &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; to facilitate social networking within their community. &lt;a href="http://www.alfresco.com"&gt;Alfresco&lt;/a&gt; has taken things to another level by &lt;a href="http://wiki.alfresco.com/wiki/Facebook"&gt;building an integration with Facebook to surface the Alfresco repository in a Facebook application&lt;/a&gt;. I think this ties nicely with the concept of &lt;a href="http://contenthere.blogspot.com/2007/11/facebook-as-your-intranet.html"&gt;using Facebook for the social networking aspect of your Intranet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;This integration uses Alfresco's &lt;a href="http://wiki.alfresco.com/wiki/Web_Scripts"&gt;Web Scripts&lt;/a&gt; feature that allows you to create your own server side API (written in Javascript) for things like AJAX-style interactivity. I think of Alfresco's philosophy as "enlightened ECM." Rather than try to build everything on their own platform (and find yourself managing a collection of second rate applications), Alfresco's strategy is to integrate with best of breed applications. You look at their website and they use &lt;a href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki"&gt;MediaWiki&lt;/a&gt; for their wiki, &lt;a href="http://wordpress.org/"&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt; for blogs, and &lt;a href="http://www.baynote.com/"&gt;Baynote&lt;/a&gt; for search. All the open standards and APIs give you great tools to do these integrations. I used to think of this as Alfresco talking the ECM talk but not walking the walk. Now I get that they see the old ECM vision as being as outdated as I do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, this strategy has its liabilities. The integration requires development work and the result doesn't always function smoothly (try searching for something on the Alfresco and you will see what I mean). Some customers just want everything out of the box (even if the features are lame and never get used) and don't want to be bothered with best of breed if it requires expensive and risky integration. However, I think it is safe to say that most current Alfresco customers (who were attracted to the product because of its architecture and standards support) like the idea of integration and service based architectures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content>

    <title>When Open Source?</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago, I presented in a session called &lt;b&gt;Open Source vs. Hosted CMS Strategies&lt;/b&gt; at &lt;a href="http://www.gilbane.com/conferences/Boston_05.html"&gt;the Gilbane Conference on Content Management Technologies&lt;/a&gt;.  Jim Howard from &lt;a href="http://www.crownpeak.com/"&gt;CrownPeak&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://greg.abstrakt.ch/"&gt;Gregor Rothfuss&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="http://lenya.apache.org/"&gt;Apache Lenya&lt;/a&gt; also presented.  &lt;a href="http://www.spconsultants.org/speakers/lyndamoulton.htm"&gt;Lynda Moulton&lt;/a&gt; moderated.  My presentation, &lt;a href="http://www.optaros.com/pdf/when_open_source_sgottlieb.ppt"&gt;"When Open source,"&lt;/a&gt; is  posted on the &lt;a href="http://www.optaros.com"&gt;Optaros website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I like the concept of the session: alternatives to the traditional software licensing model.   I think that the market has moved beyond the over-simplistic "build vs. buy."  The primary point in my talk was that the three acquisition models have different strengths and complement each other.  Open Source CMS presents the greatest opportunity for small to medium sized, occasionally updated, websites and as frameworks for building unique, high end content based applications (see slide 4 in my presentation).  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jim and Gregor both agreed with my model so those hoping for a debate may have been disappointed.  Instead, we all talked about encroaching on the domain of the commercially licensed software market.  I guess if we were joined by someone from a traditional CMS vendor, there may have been some sparks.  Maybe next year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Developers and Designers</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;A few months ago I read &lt;a href="http://ignorethecode.net/blog/2009/03/10/designers-are-not-programmers/"&gt;Lukas Mathis' through provoking essay "Designers are not Programmers"&lt;/a&gt; where he makes the case for a separation between designers and developers.  To summarize his argument, thinking about implementation details distracts the designer from the user and results in applications (and websites) that are easy to build but hard to use.  He makes a very thorough case (you should definitely read the full essay) but something just doesn't sit well with me.  In my practical experience, I find that teams are more efficient when roles overlap and people understand what is happening outside of their silo.  Here are some reasons why:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A designer is often faced with lots of options of how to solve a user problem.  When it is a coin toss between two solutions, why not choose the one that is easier to implement and apply the time and effort saved to something that really needs the additional complexity?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The static tools that pure designers use (e.g. photoshop) have no way to express interactive functionality.  All the details that the developer needs to know need to be captured in some sort of specification that can never be complete and is usually out of date.  Making the developers wait until the specification is done is inefficient.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Good software cannot be achieved by brilliant designers alone.  It takes iteration and feedback to get it right.   A cold hand-off between the designers and developers lengthens the iteration cycle (so you get fewer of them in a fixed amount of time and budget) and creates more of an opportunity for information loss.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an ideal world with infinite time and money (and omniscience too), it might be better to have designers whose minds are unencumbered by knowledge of implementation details.  Anything that they dream of can be implemented... with enough time and resources, of course.  But I don't live in that world.  In the world I live in, product managers and publishers have to make lots of compromises.  They also need to be able to react efficiently to correct bad design decisions so that the product (or website) can continually improve.  For that, you need an agile team that solve problems directly. this means staying out of a designer-only loop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most effective teams that I have worked on have all had a talented front end developer that can rapidly design in DHTML (leveraging javascript libraries and CSS) and knows enough server side scripting to make most user interface changes unassisted.  With this mix of skills, it is truly amazing how quickly a small team can get a product in front of users where it can be improved by feedback.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>How to make the most out of a vendor demo</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;After you watch a couple of vendor demos, it doesn't take long to realize that the &lt;i&gt;performance&lt;/i&gt; of the demo (how well the presenters know the product and how well they understand and connect with the audience) plays as much a part of the product impression as the quality and the capabilities of the product itself.  Given that the sales team probably is not going to be around during your implementation or when your users first start using the system, this should scare you if you are basing your selection on the product demo.  While it is important that a software vendor cares enough about your business to put some thought and effort into showing you the product, you also want to build your system on the the most suitable product.  Here are some tips to manage vendor demonstrations that will isolate the important aspects of the vendor and the product and filter out the extraneous information that may confuse or distract you.  For those software vendors out there, I hope that you read this and also &lt;a href="http://www.cmswatch.com/Feature/163-Better-Demos"&gt;Tony Byrne's advice&lt;/a&gt;. Â For people selling and evaluating open source, there are some slight nuances that I will mention at the end but probably cover more thoroughly in a different post.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Preparation&lt;/h2&gt;A successful demo is all about preparation.  You need to prepare the vendor (or systems integrator or in house staff if you are evaluating non-commercial software) with the information they need so they can do their best.  You also need to prepare the audience on what they should be looking for.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Only do demos with a short list of vendors.&lt;/b&gt;  Work with someone who knows the market to give you a short list of products to look at.  That doesn't mean asking someone "what are the best CMS."  If they know anything, they will tell you that it depends on your requirements.  If they have an opinion.  Well, it is just going to be that: an opinion.  You need to focus on a short list for two reasons.  First, if the vendor knows that he is in a field of 10 candidates, he is not going to invest as much in the demo.  He will have a junior sales team give a generic demo.  Second, when subjected sit through 10 demos, your staff will not invest as much of their attention in evaluating each product and they will start to muddle the products together. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Clearly define what you want the demo to show.&lt;/b&gt; Because content management systems (especially web content management systems) are so flexible, a demo should be a prototype that you define according to your requirements.  Just like a prototype, you need to &lt;a href="http://www.blogger.com/post-create.g?blogID=9312392"&gt;clearly specify what it needs to do.&lt;/a&gt;  The approach that I find the most effective is using scenarios that describe tasks that need to be accomplished using the system.  The demo should show how the user would accomplish that task using the product.  The demo should also recognize the constraints introduced by your architecture.  The vendor should not know you features that would not work in your architecture.  Neither should they show features that you don't need.  The demo &lt;i&gt;should&lt;/i&gt; show your content.  Ask the vendor to configure a content types that matches the the most complex content type in your content model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Validate that the vendor understands your requirements.&lt;/b&gt; Have the vendor prepare a written response describing how their product can support your scenarios.  Review it and give them feedback with ample time to adjust their demo in case they misunderstood what you need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prepare the audience.&lt;/b&gt; Prepare your audience for the demo by telling them what they should be looking for.  A scorecard that lists the scenarios is useful for keeping people's attention on their needs, not gimicky features.  If the audience does not understand basic content management theory (separation of content and layout, re-usability, content lifecycle, etc.) address that before the first demo.  Vendors are actually pretty good at explaining that stuff but there are more effective uses of their time. Â Also, vendors tend to up their game when the realize they are dealing with a sophisticated audience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;During the demo&lt;/h2&gt;The demo should use everyone's time as effectively as possible and should be organized to ensure that vital information is communicated to the right people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Limit company background information&lt;/b&gt;.  The vendor should be able to introduce their company and make the case that it is a stable company, it gets content management, and knows your industry.  However, you need to contain the amount of time that they take to do it.  They should be able to build a level of credibility and comfort with the audience but not infringe on the time they have to talk about their product within your context.  Hopefully your short-list exercise already pre-qualified the vendors along these lines. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mind your manners.&lt;/b&gt;  Even if your corporate culture thinks it is OK for staff to attend meetings in-body only, keep distractions to a minimum.  Ask your audience to put aside their email, blackberries, and cell phones and pay attention.  Give the vendors every opportunity to engage with the audience.  If the vendor is missing the mark, don't tune out.  Instead, help steer them back on course.  If you can't do that, politely end the meeting as quickly as possible and be happy that you were able to eliminate an option in a very hard decision. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mark your scorecards&lt;/b&gt;.  Without making it feel like a Bingo hall, have the audience take notes in their scorecards so that they remember what they saw and their impressions.   By the time they have gotten back to their desks and answered their first of fifty waiting emails, they will have forgotten half of what they saw. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Break up the meeting.&lt;/b&gt; A thorough demo is enough to tax anyone's endurance.  Not everyone needs to hear everything and people tend to lose focus after sitting for long periods of time.  I usually break up demos into three main sessions.  The first is the company background and functional session that all the stakeholders should attend.  This is when the vendor walks through the scenarios and helps business users visualize using the product to get their jobs done.  The next session is the technical session that shows what is going on behind the scenes and how the system can be customized and integrated.  All the business users that are still awake can leave for the technical part.  If they are asleep, leave them alone and let them dream about life with better content management tools.  They can use the rest.  The third session is the project management and licensing part where the vendor talks about the licensing needs, cost, and professional services.  Your project management people and tech leads need to be part of the discussion.  Everyone else can go back and extinguish the fires that have probably ignited during their absence. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;"Yes" is not a good enough answer.&lt;/b&gt; When you ask if the system can do something, don't let the vendor get away with a simple "yes."  Have them show it.  And if they are not prepared to show it, have them describe how it would work and how much effort it would take to get it to work like that.  You could also ask to speak to other customers that are using the product in that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Follow up&lt;/h2&gt;Don't let wait long to get feedback from the audience.  It doesn't take long for people to forget.  Follow up and plan the next steps as soon as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;The post mortem.&lt;/b&gt;  As soon as possible, get everyone in a room and have them express their observations and impressions.  Ask them what they didn't see.  Hopefully, they have notes on their scorecards.  There were probably some scenarios that were not adequately explained.  Get this information so you can follow up with the vendor. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Schedule follow ups.&lt;/b&gt;  Talk through what additional information is needed with each of the vendors who earne&lt;br/&gt;d further consideration.  For the vendors that didn't make the cut, explain why.  If the demo was a disaster but you think the product still has potential, you could give them another chance or you could take it as a sign that they are not prepared to support you.   Remember, after the contract is signed, things are only going to get worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prototype.&lt;/b&gt;  If there is a question about something, build a prototype and allow users to bang on it.  Different vendors will have different policies around this.  Some create hosted sand boxes and allow business users to experiment.  Others provide trial versions of the software so that a customer can attend training and try to build the prototype themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Demos can either clarify or confuse, inform or misinform.  If run properly, they can be the most important part of the selection process.  At the end of the day, both you and the vendors are after the same goals.  They want customers that are successful with their software.  You want to be a customer that is successful with their software.  However, that doesn't mean that a sales team can't get swept up trying to win a deal.  It also doesn't mean that business users will not lose sight their goals when distracted by flashy features and a compelling demo performance.  Be up front with this and try to work together to achieve this goal. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What about open source software?  For the commercial open source products out there, this advice still holds.  You just want to be even more sensitive about using the vendors time efficiently because they have less to gain in terms of licensing revenues. Assign some of your technical staff to dig around the product (and the community) for themselves. Â If a commercial open source vendor is able to invest in large sales teams, you can be pretty sure they have a pricing model (around support and maintenance) where they can collect revenues that are equivalent to commercially licensed software.  Either that or they haven't had to think about building a sustainable software business yet.  For community-based projects, you are not going to get a sales team.  You should form an internal team (or pay a systems integrator) to build the prototype and play the role of the sales engineer.  You probably need to do more homework to decide what platform(s) you should evaluate and be even more diligent in documenting your requirements. Â Otherwise, your developers will get drawn to nifty architectures and technology buzzwords and neglect what your business users need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Email is the portal</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.aberdeen.com/"&gt;Aberdeen&lt;/a&gt; is a Market Intelligence company. We provide market data (Firmographic, Technographic, Leads, and Intent) as well as quantitative and qualitative insights based on those data. My primary role as Chief Technology Officer is to develop and improve products that deliver and maximize the value of these data and insights. This is really the same "right content, right context, right time" problem that I have been working on for years as a content management professional.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Our strategy for detail data is to push them directly to the systems where they are actionable. For example, our &lt;a href="https://www.aberdeen.com/product/aberdeen-intent-for-salesforce/"&gt;Aberdeen Intent for Salesforce app&lt;/a&gt; creates Salesforce opportunities out of companies that are showing intent. The Salesforce app also includes some charts to visualize summaries and trends. We also have other apps to help Salesforce users interact with our firmographic and technographic data. But Salesforce accounts are often rationed and not everyone spends their time there. The conventional answer to reach other users is a customer portal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But does the world really need yet another portal?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technical and non-technical roles are forced to work in so many different platforms. I feel especially bad for marketers (queue the scary &lt;a href="https://chiefmartec.com/2019/04/marketing-technology-landscape-supergraphic-2019/"&gt;Brinker SuperGraphic&lt;/a&gt;). But every office job today seems to involve logging into different systems to check in on various dashboards or consoles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, single sign-on can make authentication easier. But SSO is rarely configured because so few of these systems are owned by Corp IT. Plus, you need to remember where to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, an email alert can suggest when it may be worthwhile to check in on a dashboard. But establishing the right threshold for notification involves time consuming trial and error that few have the patience for. It only takes a few "false alarm" notifications to make you hesitate before following a link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corporate portal technologies tried to solve this problem by assembling views (portlets) into one interface but the result was both unwieldy and incomplete. There is a constant flow of BI initiatives that try to solve this problem by bringing the data together into a unified place. Too complicated. Too cumbersome. And yet another place to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So most users are doomed to flit from portal to portal like a bee looking for nectar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am starting to believe that we already have the unified, integrated portal we have been looking for. It is the email client where we spend hours of every work day. Rather than develop a dashboard or portal that people need to go to, deliver simple glance-able email reports that highlight what is new/different and needs attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Longtime readers of this blog may be aware of my &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2006/05/email-and-content-management_44.html"&gt;contempt for email as a collaboration and information management tool&lt;/a&gt;. However, even in the age of Slack, there is no more reliable way to notify business users than email. Decision makers live in their email clients. If you want to get information in front of someone, the best place to put it is in their inbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Designing email-friendly business intelligence is not trivial. Beyond the technical limitations of email clients' HTML rendering capabilities, you also have to consider the context. People are already overloaded with email so the reports need to minimize cognitive load. They need to quickly convey what is important within a couple distracted seconds. Perhaps even on a mobile phone in between meetings. Less is more - just a few Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to make the user feel like he is in the loop and can answer questions about the status of the program or take action if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frequency is also an important factor. The cadence should align with the decision making cycle. These emails are not for catching daily anomalies. Those types of warnings are better handled by system alerts that only go out when thresholds are met (behind schedule, over budget, no data detected...). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I think about a portal to deliver Aberdeen's market intelligence insight, I keep going back to the question, what if our BI portal wasn't a portal at all? Wouldn't it be better to put our data into user interfaces that our clients are already looking at?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Keeping your content DRY</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;After over 10 years of working in content management, I have come to realize that there is only one way to learn the value of managing structured information: the hard way &amp;mdash; and that way is only 50% effective.  People can intellectually accept concepts like content re-use and content/layout separation, but in the heat of the moment, few can resist the siren song of a word processor and the clipboard.  Pasting in a bunch of text into a rich text area (and then re-formatting it) provides so much more instant gratification than data entry into the fields of a structured content form.  It is only after a number of painful global content changes that people come to realize that the value of all that painstaking WYSIWYG work has a very short shelf life.  It is not until a migration onto another platform that one becomes aware of all that semi-redundant content.  But that realization only happens around half the time.  The other half of the time the site's unmanageability is blamed on the CMS.  A clear sign that the content manager didn't make the connection is when there is a requirement that the new CMS have a global search and replace feature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As someone who has seen many companies succeed and fail (and really fail) with content management, it is easy for me to notice these patterns.  But that doesn't mean that I can make anyone short-circuit his/her learning process.  If I were able to forcefully impose a highly structured content model on a client, all they would notice was the complexity of the content entry forms.  They would take for granted the downstream benefits.  The best you can do is gently guide and hope that guidance will lead to recognition when the site becomes unmanageable.  I don't get too worked up about it.  If I get frustrated, I can just talk to my friends in the DITA/XML advocate community.  Their pain in working with technical documentation teams is way worse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the software development world, we have the concept of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself"&gt;DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)&lt;/a&gt;.  The idea is "every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system."  I call the opposite of DRY WET (Write Everything Thrice) or DAMP (Developer Accepts Maintenance Problems. Hat tip to &lt;a href="http://blog.spilth.org/"&gt;Brian Kelly&lt;/a&gt;).  This means copying and pasting code (rather than referencing it) or writing the same data over and over again.  Part of the development process is recognizing patterns and coming up with ways to reduce redundancy.  Good developers are constantly thinking about maintaining the code they write because they will inevitably need to add a feature of fix a bug.  And the feedback cycle is really short for developers.  You write a bit of code, test it, fix it, write some more code, test that and the first code you wrote, fix it....  If you did anything stupid, the time you have to wait before suffering for it is usually short.  I am not saying that all developers practice DRY, but they have a better track record than content contributors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most content contributors don't have that short feedback loop.  Too often, content is considered a "set it and forget it" initiative.  You publish and move on.  But I am seeing two positive trends in the content management industry that may shorten the feedback loop.  First, there has been some great thought leadership around solving the &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2010/06/jeff-cram-your-website-is-not-a-project.html"&gt;"post launch paradigm"&lt;/a&gt;.  Second, many CMS vendors are building in analytics and multivariate testing functionality that encourages the content manager to constantly tweak a website to maximum performance.  &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2009/12/are-content-managers-ready-for-personalization.html"&gt;My hope is that awareness of this functionality will compel buyers to think of their content in a more dynamic way&lt;/a&gt; &amp;mdash; something that evolves and improves like software.  Then maybe we will hear content managers talking about their websites being DRY, WET, or DAMP.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>The Interruptible Programmer</title>
    <content type='html'>I just read Steve Streeting's excellent post &lt;a href="http://www.stevestreeting.com/2010/09/04/work-2-0/"&gt;Work 2.0 – the interruptible programmer&lt;/a&gt; where he counters the conventionally assumed benefit of long hours of uninterrupted programming.  It took a bad back to make Steve realize that programming for long hours at a time was not only unhealthy, but it was also unproductive.  I have to agree with his conclusion.  You need to break up your work to alternate between the two ways of thinking, which the book &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1934356050?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=contenthere-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1934356050"&gt;Pragmatic Thinking and Learning: Refactor Your Wetware&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=contenthere-20&amp;amp;l=as2&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=1934356050" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" /&gt; calls the L-Mode and R-Mode (Seriously, buy the book if your job requires you to use your brain).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While I agree with the conclusion, I do have a problem with the word "interruptible."  Breaks are great, but I still do think that interruptions are bad.  The difference between the two is that breaks can be planned, interruptions are not and can happen at really disruptive times in your thought process.  As Steve eloquently describes "When you’re in that Zone, you’re juggling a whole bunch of context in your head, adjusting it on the fly, and maintaining and tweaking connections between issues constantly."  I love that juggling metaphor because that is what it feels like.  When a colleague stops by your desk to tell you that he just sent you an email, all the balls that you were juggling fall to the ground and it can take a really long time to get them back in the air.  The article lists some useful techniques to help you freeze that context so the balls don't roll too far when an interruption happens, but they all require some proactive habits.  If the interruption happens right before you save your context, you lost everything since the last save.  It is a little like auto-save in Microsoft Word — it is great at mitigating loss but computer crashes still suck.  Similarly, regularly auto-saving your context makes you more interruptible (that is, less damage is done) but that doesn't mean interruptions are good.  The article even makes the point that you should table tangential tasks rather than interrupting yourself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When I am really slammed with work, I try to practice the &lt;a href="http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/"&gt;Pomodoro Technique&lt;/a&gt; and I think that Steve's context saving, prioritizing, and pacing strategies are very compatible with it.  In particular, as your 25 minute timer runs down on a work session, it is a really good time to spend a few minutes saving context when you are still in the zone.  I will have to try that, but that won't make me interruptible.</content>

    <title>A content manager&amp;#39;s many hats</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;CMSWire's recent article  &lt;a href="http://www.cmswire.com/cms/customer-experience/the-seven-hats-content-managers-will-wear-in-2012-014240.php"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Seven Hats Content Managers Will Wear in 2012&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; drives home a point that I have been making a lot recently.  It's the point that inspired me to take a full-time job with Lionbridge to scale the &lt;a href="http://globalmarketingops.com/"&gt;Global Marketing Operations&lt;/a&gt; offering.  Engaging audiences with content is hard work and it doesn't matter that your CMS makes it easy to edit web pages.  As the article describes, a modern content manager is a content collector, a context controller, an eavesdropper, a concierge, a right-brain thinker, a number cruncher, and a bodyguard.  And that is just to manage a site in one language.  For a global site, you might as well add "international (wo)man of mystery" to that list.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One thing you realize after years of content management consulting is that the tools play a relatively small role in a company's ability to maintain an excellent digital presence.  Skills, process, and commitment play a much larger role.  If you don't have those, no technology is going to help you. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently I appeared on a &lt;a href="http://www.cms-connected.com/Previous-Shows/Web-CMS-Year-in-Review-2011.aspx"&gt;CMS-Connected&lt;/a&gt; and we talked a lot about web engagement.  I mentioned that the market, as a whole, failed to get sufficient value from the content production functionality of upper tier WCM platforms.  Most customers didn't have the process, skills, and commitment to fully leverage workflow and other content management functionality.  As a result, many found themselves owning &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2006/10/the-6-million-dollar-wysiwyg-editor.html"&gt;6 million dollar wysiwyg editors&lt;/a&gt;.  CMS vendors has responded by shifting the value over to the delivery side with functionality like personalization, multivariate testing, and analytics.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One thing that I wished I said on the show was that, unless customers increase their people commitment (time, skills, and process) to managing their websites, the upper tier CMS vendors won't achieve value on the delivery side either.  So far, I am finding that most customers are under-utilizing these advanced marketing features that were so important in their platform buying decision.  If only they had more hats...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your company runs a website (and what company doesn't?), I want you to take the web manager out to lunch.  You will probably learn that he is overworked and would love to be doing so much more but limitations of time and skills prevent it.  You may hear will hear that &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2010/02/the-myth-of-the-occasional-cms-user.html"&gt;the CMS didn't really remove the webmaster bottleneck&lt;/a&gt; and all of his time is spent chasing down and posting content.  He might confess his embarrassment from how bad the site looks on mobile devices.  In short, the web manager has his hands full just getting content on the site and can't even think about maximizing the reach and effectiveness of the website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you hear these signals, your organization probably has a lot of growth to do before it can fully realize the benefits that web engagement functionality promises.  You need to acquire some more hats before you go software shopping.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>In-Context and Power User Interfaces: One for the Sale, the Other for
the Content Manager</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;A dirty little secret in the CMS industry is that, while in-context editing is often what sells a CMS, the "power user" interface is usually what winds up getting used after implementation.  This phenomenon obviously creates problems in the selection process because, when the sales demo focus on an interface that users will quickly grow out of, any usability impressions are irrelevant.  This is also part of a bigger problem: the importance of in-context editing for sales has caused many CMS vendors to neglect their power user interface.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is easy to understand why the sales demo gravitates to the in-context user interface: the audience finds it more intuitive.  What is less obvious is why.  In a typical CMS sales demonstration, the audience &lt;em&gt;has the perspective of a site visitor&lt;/em&gt;.  After all, this is not their site.  They have no responsibility for it.  As a site visitor, we think of editing the content that we see: "I see a typo;" "that sentence is hard to read;" "I would prefer to see another picture here." The user just wants to go in and fix it &amp;mdash; like a Wikipedia article.  Until it's fixed, that content issue is going to bug the user so directness and immediacy are critical. Like with a wiki, the in-context is ideal for solving these kinds of problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The content manager, however, has an entirely different perspective.  The content manager is thinking more about the whole web site than any one page.  The content manager has to solve problems like re-organizing the website and making global content changes.  Needing to manually change every single page of a website is not acceptable so content reuse should be top of mind.  From this perspective, the appearance of a page is less important than the actual content, which also includes information you can't see on the page but drives the behavior of the site.  You can even go so far as to say that the visible page (what the visitor sees) actively hides information that the content manager needs to see.  The visitor shouldn't know where else a piece of content is featured on the web site or what caused the personalization logic to show this item in this particular case &amp;mdash; but the content manager does.  Incidentally, this is why you should make product demos focus on scenarios.  Scenarios force you to think about what the content manager does - not just dream of being able to edit somebody else's web site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, you can make the argument that the occasional content contributor (who 80% of the time experiences the site as a visitor) needs a simplified user interface to fix the issues that they notice or keep a few bits of information up to date.  But, as an organization gets more sophisticated with managing content, those cases of simplistically managed pages (with no reuse and no presentation logic) get less frequent.  At that point, you are just talking about the "about us" page and some simple press releases.  Are you surprised that this is what your basic generic CMS demo shows?  Furthermore, I am beginning to believe that the occasional user is a myth (another blog post).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In-context editing interfaces are steadily getting more powerful by exposing functionality like targeting and A/B testing but there inevitably comes a point when the content manager wants the full power of the application at his fingertips.  As the in-context editors get better, that point gets pushed further out.  But adding complexity and power to the in-context editing interface will no doubt steepen the learning curve for the occasional user and minimize the wow factor of the demo.  And no CMS vendor will do anything to reduce the wow factor of their product demo.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>ECM as Infrastructure</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;A couple of days ago, I listened to an &lt;a href="http://www.aiim.org/article-webinar.asp?ID=30874"&gt;AIIM webinar&lt;/a&gt; presented by &lt;a href="http://www.stellent.com"&gt;Stellent&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.doculabs.com"&gt;DocuLab's&lt;/a&gt; Jeetu Patel.  It has been a few months since I have listened to commercial ECM messaging and I have to admit that I was a little surprised.  The key theme was ECM as Infrastructure. This concept is not new, Alan Pelz-Sharp &lt;a href="http://www.cmswatch.com/Feature/138-Enterprise-Content-Management"&gt;nicely described&lt;/a&gt; the trend of Oracle, ECM, IBM, and Microsoft working their way into the content management market.  The growth of several standards in content management (&lt;a href="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=170"&gt;JSR 170&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=168"&gt;JSR 168&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=docbook"&gt;DocBook&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=dita"&gt;DITA&lt;/a&gt;...) shows that buyers now think the technology has reached a point where it is "good enough" and they will no longer stand for being locked into a single vendor's technology stack.  Now that the basic functionality is widely available, companies can now make more strategic choices about their technology portfolio.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What surprised me was that the message was sponsored and endorsed by &lt;a href="http://www.stellent.com"&gt;Stellent&lt;/a&gt;, a pure-play content management company.  Moving content management into an infrastructure play essentially commoditizes the space and makes it even more accessible to the big hardware/software vendors and, you guessed it, open source.  This reminds me a little of &lt;a href="http://www.atg.com"&gt;ATG&lt;/a&gt;.  They used to have one of the better Java web development platforms.  They were one of the earlier companies to have a certified J2EE application server and they pushed the envelope on Java Server Pages with their tag libraries.  We all know what happened after that.  Java application servers became dominated by &lt;a href="http://www.bea.com"&gt;BEA&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.ibm.com"&gt;IBM&lt;/a&gt; then open source (&lt;a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/"&gt;Tomcat&lt;/a&gt; (really a servlet container but frequently used as a web application server), &lt;a href="http://www.jboss.org"&gt;JBoss&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://jonas.objectweb.org/"&gt;JonAS&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://geronimo.apache.org/"&gt;Geronimo&lt;/a&gt;) so ATG got out of it.  Their repository layer was no longer special thanks to open source object-relational mapping technologies like &lt;a href="http://www.hibernate.org/"&gt;Hibernate&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.castor.org/index.html"&gt;Castor&lt;/a&gt;.  Their "Nucleus" architecture is no better than open source Inversion of Control frameworks like &lt;a href="http://www.springframework.org/"&gt;Spring&lt;/a&gt;.  Now they just keep their customers with their personalization and commerce functionality.  The customers that don't use these features are drifting away from the technology.  So will Stellent become a big infrastructure winner like BEA, IBM, and Oracle?  Or will it suffer the same decline that ATG did?    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jeetu's part of the talk was mainly about Service Oriented Architecture, which is also one of &lt;a href="http://www.optaros.com/practices_soa.shtml"&gt;our practices&lt;/a&gt;.  Our SOA practice lead, &lt;a href="http://www.optaros.com/company_team.shtml#michelson"&gt;Adam Michelson&lt;/a&gt; has two excellent white papers (&lt;a href="http://www.optaros.com/wp/wp_2_soa_oss.shtml"&gt;"Service Oriented Architecture and Open Source Solutions"&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.optaros.com/wp/wp_4_soa_delivery.shtml"&gt;"Delivering Service Oriented Architecture"&lt;/a&gt;) that discuss how to leverage open source in service oriented architecture.  One of the key aspects that Adam really understands and is able to eloquently communicate is that SOA is more than just installing an Enterprise Service Bus (ESB).  Success in SOA, like all previous generations of Enterprise Architecture, requires diligent planning and consideration for the organizational and political context.  The technological plumbing is secondary.  You just need to make sure that you are supporting the right standards, your components are reliable, and get into the right pricing model success (putting more applications on the bus) is not cost prohibitive.  Adam also makes the point that it is difficult for a Service Oriented Architecture to cross divisional or P&amp;L lines because of conflicting priorities and the inability to standardize.  So maybe an enterprise-wide content infrastructure in a large company is unrealistic.  I think Jeetu's talk, while very good, under-emphasized these issues.  Still, I think that there is a huge potential to establish some core content services at the divisional level - which is where most I.T. decisions are really made anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other good points in the talk:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;80% of content is unstructured&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;90% of content is unmanaged&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This unstructured content grows at a rate of 36% per year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow.  I have to get to work!&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>OpenCms Days 2008 Report</title>
    <content type='html'>The &lt;a href="http://www.opencms.org"&gt;OpenCms&lt;/a&gt; community just finished its first user/developer conference (&lt;a href="http://www.opencms-days.org/"&gt;OpenCms Days 2008&lt;/a&gt;) in Cologne Germany.  Thank you to our hosts &lt;a href="http://www.alkacon.com"&gt;Alkacon Software&lt;/a&gt; and the sponsors for putting on such a valuable and fun event.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OpenCms is primarily used in Europe so Cologne (home of Alkacon) was a good choice of venue.  If you ever have an opportunity to visit Cologne, you should.  It is a beautiful city.  Many of the 110 attendees were mostly from Germany but there was also representation from Italy, Spain, Denmark, Czech Republic and there was one attendee from Japan.  &lt;br /&gt;The only Americans there were speakers but maybe that was just the weak dollar talking.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since OpenCms is essentially a commercial open source project (owned and developed by Alkacon) aimed at enterprise buyers, the feel was different than some of the other open source conferences I have been to.  It was more corporate, less kumbaya.  But there seemed to be a genuine interest in collaboration and community across corporate boundaries.  The main question was where to begin.  Having the conference was a great start.  I saw many first face to face meetings turn into what looked like closer relationships over the two day event.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were also promises of better inter-company communication - in particular between Alkacon, module developers, and systems integrators. Several attendees had expressed frustration that they had built modules that were quickly either broken or made obsolete by  a new release of the the core.  The community wanted Alkacon to be more transparent about their roadmap but Alkacon was concerned about making promises that they couldn't keep  (Nonetheless, Alkacon CEO, Alexander Kandzior's keynote did a nice job of describing the next few releases of OpenCms at a high level). There were commitments to fix this through sprints (first is July 21-22 2008 in Cologne) and better general communication but, of course, the real proof will be when people return their jobs.    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another observation I had was that the community that I saw seemed much less wrapped up in social media and networking.  Most of the conferences that I go to advertise keywords that everyone should use to tag their photos, blogs, and tweets with when they post them on the social networking sites.  I got a sense that few within the community used these services.  Granted, my expectations for social media use are probably set overly high by the types of projects and people that I follow and the conferences that I attend.  I think it is safe to say that Web 2.0 will not be high on the list for OpenCms enhancements.  I think that most OpenCms adopters are fine with that prioritization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sessions fell into 2 tracks: business and technical.  The technical track covered techniques for integrating and customizing OpenCms.  The business track showed OpenCms being used in large companies like Bayer, Qimonda, GARDENA, and OEV Online Dienste.  Many of these clients have used OpenCms to replace commercial products and are expanding their use of the OpenCms after initial successes.  The sites include Intranets, Extranets, Corporate marketing sites and other forms of traditional web content management.  They had requirements that are typical of enterprise buyers: large volumes of content, many users with a wide range of technical abilities, and complex organizational structures that require content sharing and access control.  Two very good examples were Qimonda's intranet and OEV which hosts mult-tiered websites for 15 insurance companies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it was a great conference and (hopefully) the first of many events like it.  I will be keeping my eye on the mailing list for follow through on the promises of more community collaboration and communication.</content>

    <title>Usability and Intuition</title>
    <content type='html'>I am going to stop using the word "intuitive" when I am talking about software and I think that  everyone else should too.  Judging from a &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=intuitive+site%3Acontenthere.blogspot.com&amp;start=0&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official"&gt;Google search on my blog&lt;/a&gt;, I seem to be doing a good job of not abusing the word so far.  But I want to use "intuitive" even less.  The problem is that when people say that something is "intuitive", they are implying that it makes intrinsic sense to any rational human being.  However, what they really mean is that it makes sense to them based on &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;their own frame of reference&lt;/span&gt;.  This is, of course, irrelevant to anyone who does not have the same exact frame of reference.   So rather than say something is intuitive, why not say that it would probably make sense to someone that is used to using software XYZ and not be so egocentric?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I understood this point at some level for a long time but it became really obvious to me recently when someone I know was having a really hard time learning to use a Mac after years of being a PC user.  I am not naming names because it is so uncool and potentially socially alienating not to gush over the Mac UI. The Mac and Windows are similar in some ways and, in others, they are very different. Those differences are extremely disorienting and frustrating when all you want to do is move around the computer with the instinct that you have developed over the years from using another platform.  You learn to use a computer.  You are not born with the instincts to use one.  Therefore, it is not intuitive.  Duh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is not to say that a software program cannot make itself become more learnable by behaving consistently across its different functions.  I think that is what people sometimes mean by the word intuitive - a user can infer how one feature is going to work based on behavior of another feature that the user has already learned.  For example, if the application always has right-click context-sensitive menus, a user trains himself to right click when trying to execute a function.  However, there is no innate, primordial instinct to right-click.  The user is must making logical assumptions after getting over an initial learning curve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite claims of intuitiveness and user-friendlines, usability is probably the single most vexing issue in the content management industry.  Most people don't like their content management tools and undermine their employers content management efforts by working around them.  So what can be done to solve this problem?  If you let go of the intuitive myth, you can go in two general directions: you can accept that people will need training on software; or you can try to mimic things that you know your users are familiar with (in other words, piggy back off of someone else's training).   Both of these  have their issues and chances are, you will have to do a little bit of both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the past few years, we have been conditioned to expect that software can be deployed without training.  Years ago, when I worked for relatively large companies there were regularly held training sessions on how to use critical business applications.  I see less of that now because of standardization on suites like Microsoft Office.  If you don't know how to use MS Word, you probably wouldn't get past the first interview.  There is also now a critical mass of experienced users so that a newbie can "groundhog" over his cubicle wall and ask - so training is happening, just not in the classroom.  Public facing web applications are even harder to train people on because new users arrive totally spontaneously.  Online help somewhat solves the problem but people seem to be reading this less and less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mimic strategy is in tension with the software industry's culture of innovation.  Companies want to differentiate.  They want their customers to upgrade to new versions.  Software designers and developers like to be clever.  Users don't want to be clever at all.  They don't want to think about the tool.  They are totally focused on their business task.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back in the early days of the web, things were really chaotic with web designers actively trying to break conventions and build something unique.  This was when you had all those websites with tiny text and icons meant to be cryptic.  For a little while, that was OK because the web was recreational and users were into exploring and appreciated the reward of finding hidden gems.  Now that the web has matured into a business tool that people need to use to get their job done, websites look a lot more uniform:  tabbed or left side navigation, a footer of informational links, search and help on the upper right.   While not truly "intuitive" these designs are familiar to someone that is used to visiting websites.   Designers have learned to focus their creativity to solve specific problems within a uniform framework.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both of these practices can and have been applied to content management interfaces up to a certain point.   You see contextual help and you see user interface patterns modeled after familiar business applications such as Office.  You even see content management software using familiar external tools as work environments - for example, authoring in Word, Outlook integration, dragging and dropping files like in Windows Explorer.  However, these strategies tend to break down when dealing with concepts specific to content management.  For example, versioning is totally beyond the physical desktop metaphor on which most desktop applications are based.  Most users don't get versioning because it deals with a fourth dimension (time) that is not well represented in a three dimensional virtual space so they create multiple copies of the document with different file names.  Workflow state is another concept that is difficult to represent with familiar tools (although a common hack is to use folders).   So are the concepts of metadata and &lt;a href="http://www.cmscalendar.com/cmsr-glossary.html?term=SingleSourcePublishing"&gt;single sourcing&lt;/a&gt;.   CMS that embrace the familiar tools strategy tend to under-deliver or under-emphasize these content management features.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are some adjustments that I think that the content management industry needs to adopt rather than go on believing they can independently innovate away the usability issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Accept that content management is a discipline with some skills and concepts that practitioners need to learn.  This is why &lt;a href="http://www.cmprofessionals.org"&gt;CM Professionals&lt;/a&gt; was created.  Vendors have to stop training these concepts just within the concept of their toolset.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Participate in User Interface standards that address content management best practices and theory.  Someone started a &lt;a href="http://www.openusability.org/projects/cms-uig/"&gt;working group&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="http://www.openusability.org"&gt;OpenUsability&lt;/a&gt;.  It is probably not going to go anywhere unless the commercial vendors get behind it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Create a standard CMS enabled UI.  This is the idea behind the &lt;a href="http://apogee.nuxeo.org/"&gt;Apogee Project&lt;/a&gt;.  There are also extensions to Windows Explorer that add additional right click menus for content management tasks.  For an example of this, check out the &lt;a href="http://www.tortoisecvs.org/"&gt;Tortiose CVS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/"&gt;Tortoise SVN&lt;/a&gt; projects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When selecting a CMS, take into consideration tools that the intended users are used to using right now.  Show them the UI.  It will either resonate with them or not.  This is why there are so many different CMS out there.  Each one is the result of someone (or a group of people) solving a problem from their own frame of reference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do not give every user group the exact same tools and expect them to be equally happy with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Accept that you will need to customize t&lt;br/&gt;he user interface to make it work within the users' business context.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;A couple of trends make me think that these adjustments are within reach.  The rise of open source opens a number of possibilities: the ability to experiment with different solutions, the ability ot customize, and the value that the open source community places on standards.  Also, content management functionality is being pushed down into the infrastructure layer where it can be more ubiquitous.  Eventually, features like versioning, metadata and workflow state will become better integrated into the baseline computing environment that everyone is familiar with.  I know that there will be compromises between purist theory and practical implementation, but it is a step in the right direction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People don't make intuitive user interfaces.  Someone's frame of reference makes an interface appear intuitive.  Software makers need to pick a target audience and leverage what these users already know.  Users need to expand their frame of reference to include content management concepts.   Consultants need to really understand where the users are coming from and use that as a starting point for designing the solution.   It is just intuitive.  DOH!</content>

    <title>Deane Barker&amp;#39;s tips on requests for proposals</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;While it may seem counter-intuitive to listen to a supplier telling you how to buy, you should definitely read Deane Barker's article "&lt;a href="http://blendinteractive.com/blog/business/getting-good-rfp-response/"&gt;Five Tips to Getting a Good Response to a Content Management RFP&lt;/a&gt;."  Deane is a co-founder of &lt;a href="http://blendinteractive.com"&gt;Blend Interactive&lt;/a&gt;, a web design and development firm.  That may put him on the other side of the negotiation table but, as a potential partner, he wants you to be successful in your initiative as much as you do.  That is actually not so out of the ordinary.  As a consultant, you want to spend your time with clients who you have a great working relationship with.  The better consultants can be more selective in the opportunities they pursue and nothing sends off more bad vibes than a dysfunctional selection process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The article agrees with all the advice that I give &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/category/selection"&gt;on my blog&lt;/a&gt; (it even quotes me!).  The one tip that buyers are going to question is openly stating budget.  I tend to go back and forth on that myself.  The benefit is that budget is the best way to communicate what you think the size of the project is.  Getting that piece of information out in the open early will help the vendor present a solution that is in line with what you had envisioned.  It also reduces the risk of harboring unrealistic expectations of what you can do.  The risk of communicating budget is that the integrator will inflate the price to maximize margin.  My current thinking is that you shouldn't be working with a partner who you fear will take advantage of you.  You should structure your selection process to verify the integrity as much as the skills and experience of the vendor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are in the market for a development partner, &lt;a href="http://blendinteractive.com/blog/business/getting-good-rfp-response/"&gt;read these tips&lt;/a&gt;.  If you can get to Boston next month, you should join me in my &lt;a href="http://gilbaneboston.com/workshops.html#workshopa"&gt;CMS Selection Workshop&lt;/a&gt; at the Gilbane conference. In fact, &lt;a href="http://blendinteractive.com/blog/other/gilbane-boston/"&gt;Deane is going to be there too.&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>RFP Horror at the RNC</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sggottlieb/3343221537/" title="tre_cms by sggottlieb, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3346/3343221537_4708889014_o.gif" width="360" height="96" alt="tre_cms" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How could the RNC not select a CMS called &lt;a href="http://www.theredelephant.org/tre-cms/the-red-elephant-content-management-system.html"&gt;The Red Elephant&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br/&gt;(this image is copyrighted by Red Elephant ICT &amp;amp;  Internet Services)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://greg.abstrakt.ch/"&gt;Gregor Rothfuss&lt;/a&gt; sent me a link to a &lt;a href="http://techpresident.com/blog-entry/rncs-tech-rfp-returns-nervous-laughter"&gt;report about a ridiculous CMS RFP issued by the RNC&lt;/a&gt;.  As I have written before, &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2008/02/the-rfp-is-dead-long-live-the-rfp.html"&gt;the traditional RFP process is totally broken&lt;/a&gt;.  Here, the RFP asks for innovation around sketchy buzzwords that are meant to be requirements yet still asks for a fixed bid.  I wonder how the RNC could avoid selecting a &lt;a href="http://www.theredelephant.org/tre-cms/the-red-elephant-content-management-system.html"&gt;CMS called The Red Elephant&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my &lt;a href="http://gilbaneboston.com/pre-conference_workshops.html#workshop-a"&gt;Web Content Management Selection workshop at last year's Gilbane Conference&lt;/a&gt;, I told a story about a fictitious botched selection process for an imaginary website.  This may be one of those cases where reality is better than fiction so I am thinking that the RNC RFP should be my anti-example when I teach the &lt;a href="http://gilbanesf.com/workshops.html#workshopa"&gt;selection workshop this summer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>J. Boye: Best Practices for Creating a Web Strategy</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;In my technology consulting engagements the first step is to verify that there is some sort of web strategy in place that will help prioritize requirements and define budgetary constraints.  If it is not clear how the website(s) fits in with the client's overall business objectives, how are they to determine what capabilities they should be looking for and how much investment they can justify?  Stating that the website needs to be more attractive is not enough.  You need to know what business activities the websites should support and how.  Usually my clients have done most of this work before hiring me, but, when they don't, I need to scramble a bit to help establish enough of a strategy to move forward&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next time I am in a situation where remedial web strategy work is needed, I will insist that the client purchase, read, and apply &lt;a href="http://jboye.com"&gt;J. Boye's&lt;/a&gt; new report &lt;a href="http://www.jboye.com/research/reports/webstrategy/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Best Practices for Creating a Web Strategy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  In writing the report, Dorthe Jesperson and Peter Nissen interviewed 19 organizations across several industry verticals including manufacturing, healthcare, and government.  They also draw on experience from years of working with J. Boye community of practices.  The result is a critical resource for developing a successful web strategy &amp;mdash; one that attracts budget for critical activities and gives grounds to reject requests that do not align with the company goals.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you find yourself grappling with these issues, I strongly recommend that you purchase &lt;a href="http://www.jboye.com/research/reports/webstrategy/"&gt;Best Practices for Creating a Web Strategy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>New Community Site Using Drupal</title>
    <content type='html'>A new community site just launched on the &lt;a href="http://drupal.org"&gt;Drupal&lt;/a&gt; platform.  &lt;a href="http://www.thedatevine.com/"&gt;The Date Vine&lt;/a&gt; is a site where people can post things to do and places to go.  Despite the name, the activities are not all romantic.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kind of site is the perfect use for Drupal.  The tagging framework ("vocabularies") allows users to categorize their entries so that they appear in different lists of content.  A voting module allows authenticated users to give listings star-based ratings.  The captcha module verifies that a human being is registering for the site.  The favorites module is used so that users can quickly go back to entries they like.  Plus there is the normal Drupal features like commenting, search, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a really nice use of Drupal.  Now, if only they had a section of the site for Northampton, Massachusetts (currently only Boston, London, Los Angeles, New York, Paris, San Francisco, and Seattle are listed), then I would get really excited.  On second thought, I guess my little town would look a little silly on that list of cities.</content>

    <title>CMS Adoption. Think Vertical, Not Horizontal.</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;"Adoption." For years that word has been on the top of the list of critical success criteria for any web content management initiative. "This project will fail if we don't achieve sufficient adoption."  The goal of adoption instigated the CMS industry's usability crusade that brought us improvements like better rich text editors and in-context editing.  Still, as I have written in "&lt;a href="http://contenthere.net/2010/02/the-myth-of-the-occasional-cms-user.html"&gt;The Myth of the Occasional CMS User&lt;/a&gt;" (and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jeffcram"&gt;Jeff Cram&lt;/a&gt; took one step further with "&lt;a href="http://www.cmsmyth.com/2010/02/stop-letting-people-use-your-cms/"&gt;Step letting people use your CMS&lt;/a&gt;"), people don't clamor to use a CMS no matter how usable it is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The truth is, most successful websites are managed by a proportionally small team of dedicated professionals.  Gerry McGovern makes this point very eloquently in "&lt;a href="http://www.gerrymcgovern.com/new-thinking/decentralized-publishing-equals-amateur-web-management"&gt;Decentralized publishing equals amateur web management.&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;In most situations, the decentralized publishing model has been disastrous. The people trained tended to be relatively junior staff, for whom publishing to the website was just one more responsibility. The result was lots and lots of poor quality content that was never updated or reviewed.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does this mean that we should give up on adoption? Hardly. But I do think our thinking about adoption has been all wrong.  Most people measure adoption as the number of users who consent to using the platform.  The more people using the system, the greater the adoption.  I call this "horizontal adoption" and, like Gerry says, it is a recipe for failure. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forget about horizontal adoption and focus instead on vertical adoption.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Vertical adoption" is a measure of &lt;em&gt;how much&lt;/em&gt; the CMS is used.  High vertical adoption means using advanced features of the platform.  Vertical adoption has always been pathetically low in web content management.  Back in 2006, Lisa Welchman nailed it with her post "&lt;a href="http://www.realstorygroup.com/Blog/773-The-6-Million-Dollar-WYSIWYG-Editor"&gt;The Six Million Dollar WYSIWYG Editor&lt;/a&gt;."  Nothing has changed.  &lt;a href="http://jboye.com/blogpost/8-cms-features-customers-want-but-never-use/"&gt;Most of those flashy features that you see in a software demo are hardly used&lt;/a&gt; and the problem is getting worse, not better.  &lt;a href="http://contenthere.net/2009/12/are-content-managers-ready-for-personalization.html"&gt;Most CMS customers are simply not ready to handle today's advanced Web Experience/Engagement Management functionality&lt;/a&gt;.  I can't tell you how many customer references I have talked to that only use the most basic features.  And the software vendors are as concerned as I am about this.  At least they should be.  If vertical adoption doesn't improve, customers will migrate to cheaper, simpler software.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, vertical adoption isn't just about protecting license revenues for enterprise software companies.  If we don't improve vertical adoption, we will never achieve meaningful digital marketing goals.  The best that we can do with horizontal adoption is to have more people to fix spelling and grammar errors (and Gerry would argue that outcome is unlikely).  If we want to truly engage an audience, we need power users that can get the most out of personalization functionality and uphold the company's side of the conversation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do we improve vertical adoption?  That is the billion dollar question.  There is certainly a usability component to vertical adoption but it is different from usability aimed at horizontal adoption, which focuses on reducing training by making things intuitive and point and click.  Usability for a power user assumes  expertise and focuses on power and efficiency.  Look at an expert in any software.  They use keyboard shortcuts. The user interface appears to dance in response to the slightest movements of the operator.  But to the novice, these user interfaces can be inscrutable. Remember the Saabre terminals back when we went to travel agents to book our vacations?  Is anyone else that old?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Achieving this level of expertise requires training and specialization.  You need guidance from other experts and you need a lot of practice.  This means that your marketing operations program has to have reached a critical mass where you are doing these initiatives more or less continually.  Advanced functionality (like personalization or lead nurturing) is not something that you get right in the initial deployment and then put on auto-pilot.  You only get results when you actively use them.  Incidentally, most systems integrators are primarily focused on content modeling and template development.  They are not very good at the using advanced functionality within the context of a real content strategy &amp;mdash; like looking at &lt;a href="http://contenthere.net/2012/10/building-a-marketing-operations-program.html"&gt;the full lifecycle from planning to analyzing the results&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most organizations are really far from this level of operational maturity.  They probably know these truths to be self-evident at some level; but they are all too willing to suspend their disbelief when a software vendor tells them that, with their solution, advanced digital marketing is so easy that even the CEO could do it.  On the other side, I can see the temptation of the software vendor.  A lot of these customers are still justifying budget for software with an ROI based on cost savings.  Better tools equals less effort equals smaller team.  Would you risk being the only vendor in a selection saying that your solution will raise operational expenses by needing to hire more staff?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an industry, I think we would all benefit if we focused on promoting vertical adoption by:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;changing the conversation from "&lt;a href="http://contenthere.net/2013/08/step-right-up-and-watch-me-change-this-page-blindfolded.html"&gt;look how easy it is to edit a web page with our CMS" to a more realistic view of web operations.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;setting realistic expectations for team size and composition.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;helping to focus attention on marketing performance goals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;promoting professional services and mentorship programs to help keep customers on track.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;identifying and recognizing teams that are doing it right.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until we improve vertical adoption, the CMS industry will continue to run around in circles and  customers will never get the results that they hope for.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Joel Spolsky&amp;#39;s Translations Wiki</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Joel Spolsky, author of the very popular technical blog &lt;a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/"&gt;Joel On Software&lt;/a&gt;, is &lt;a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/01/27.html"&gt;currently doing an experiment&lt;/a&gt; of using a wiki for translating his blog content into other languages.   From his global readership, Joel definitely has the resources to do the translation, it was just the management and coordination that proved to be the problem:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Sadly, I fell down in face of the effort needed to maintain 30-odd local language versions. Such a job can't be coordinated by one person, especially when that person is me.&lt;/blockquote&gt;The &lt;a href="http://local.joelonsoftware.com/mediawiki/index.php/Main_Page"&gt;translation wiki&lt;/a&gt; (powered by &lt;a href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki"&gt;MediaWiki&lt;/a&gt;) seems to be having some success.  Joel announced the wiki on January 27th and there are already 117 registered users generating a good amount of content.  The Spanish, Greek, Hebrew, Japanese, Polish, and Russian sections have the most translations. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A wiki allows users to work directly with each other to sort out issues like "speakers of the Flemish dialect ask me to change it one way, then speakers of Netherlands Dutch suggest putting it back, and I have no idea what they're talking about!"  What of the  concern of vandalism?  Joel feels confident that the community will work it out: "If you're feeling naughty, add some fart jokes to somebody's excellent translation. We'll see if the community spots it and fixes it."  Fortunately, the Joel's readership is probably dedicated and smart enough to be up to the task.  (BTW, there are two very good articles on &lt;a href="http://www.wikipedia.org"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; in the Boston Globe &lt;a href="http://www.boston.com/business/technology/articles/2006/02/13/many_contributors_common_cause/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.boston.com/business/technology/articles/2006/02/13/the_idealists_the_optimists_and_the_world_they_share/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; that talk about the culture of the Wikipedia).  There is also a &lt;a href="http://local.joelonsoftware.com/mediawiki/index.php/Clarifications_and_Explanations"&gt;page&lt;/a&gt; that serves a place to discuss cultural reference and terminology questions.   There is also a kind of &lt;a href="http://local.joelonsoftware.com/mediawiki/index.php/Talk:Main_Page"&gt;logistics page&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="http://local.joelonsoftware.com/mediawiki/index.php/Guidelines_for_Translators"&gt;guidlines page&lt;/a&gt; to mention best practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what are the weaknesses of this format?  The key one that I see is the lack of structure.  However, it is really no worse than the source (blog entries) the only thing missing is a field for date and title.  There is a guideline to link back to the source article so it may be possible for the translations to share this information with the original article through a very loose foreign key relationship.   Using WikiText may make it easier to parse content than giving users HTML WYSIWYG editors.  It is not too difficult to parse MediaWiki text.  For example, "==" means a HTML heading level two (H2) tag.  But in a WYSIWYG editor, you would most likely get some kind of font tag which would give you no clue that this was the heading of a section.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I will keep my eye on the Joel on Software translation wiki.  It looks like it has all the ingredients for successful wiki: dedicated readership, good content, and community. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Zope Development Tools</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I just got a chance to view the automatically generated Plone API documentation site: &lt;a href="http://api.plone.org/"&gt;http://api.plone.org/&lt;/a&gt;.  As someone with a Java background, I was really happy to see such a familiar &lt;a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/javadoc/"&gt;Javadoc&lt;/a&gt; style format.  Of course, since Python is a dynamically typed language, the documentation cannot tell the data type of a method's arguments (one of the primary thing I use Javadoc for).  In order for that to happen, the documentation generation tool would have to run the program and record what variable types are successfully used as method arguments.  The main advantage that the API documentation has over looking at the actual code is that it shows a full inheritance tree and lists methods that are inherited from super-classes.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another tool that might be useful for Java programmers looking for a friendly, familiar face is &lt;a href="http://pydev.sourceforge.net/"&gt;PyDev&lt;/a&gt;, a Python plugin for &lt;a href="http://www.eclipse.org/"&gt;Eclipse&lt;/a&gt;.  PyDev does source tree navigation, text completion, method definition lookup, auto-indent, parentheses matching, code search, and automatic, real-time error checking just like what you get when you use Eclipse for Java.  I find the error checking especially useful because it shows you immediately if your indents are wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For debugging a Zope application, I was recently introduced to the Python debugger &lt;a href=""&gt;PDB&lt;/a&gt;.  It is not a visual tool integrated into the your IDE, but if you run Zope in the forground (zopectl fg), and you add the line import pdb;pdb.set_trace() into your code, you enter an interactive session where you can step through the code, write code statements, and check variable values.  Here is some good documentation to help you out:  &lt;a href="http://plone.org/documentation/how-to/using_pdb"&gt;http://plone.org/documentation/how-to/using_pdb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Get ready for Plone 3.0</title>
    <content type='html'>The GA release of &lt;a href="http://plone.org/products/plone/releases/3.0"&gt;Plone 3.0&lt;/a&gt; is right around the corner (due out August 21) and there are many new features to look forward to.  Unlike 2.5 which was a primarily architectural release, 3.0 focuses on the user interface.  Jon Stahl does an excellent job of summarizing the key improvements in his post &lt;a href="http://blogs.onenw.org/jon/archives/2007/07/16/8-really-cool-things-about-plone-3/"&gt;"8 Really Cool Things About Plone 3."&lt;/a&gt;  You can download &lt;a href="http://plone.org/products/plone/releases/3.0"&gt;release candidate 2 here&lt;/a&gt;. The features that I think are the most significant are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;versioning, staging and locking&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;more granular workflow control&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;a dependency manager called "link integrity" that prevents broken links&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;and lots of improvements to the Kupu rich text editor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</content>

    <title>Introduction to Translation Proxies</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Recently, I have been doing a lot of work with translation proxies.  A translation proxy is a service that sits in front of your website and applies translations so that different audience segments can see your content in their local languages.   You point various DNS entries to the proxy so that request goes through the proxy service to your native language website.  On the return trip, the proxy applies translation rules to the HTML in the response.    It’s a little like when Google Chrome asks you to run Google Translate on the foreign language page you are looking at.  However, unlike Google Translate, these translations are done by professional translators and there is a multi-step workflow to ensure that the translations express correct information and tone.   Of the three ways that &lt;a href="http://globalmarketingops.com/"&gt;Global Marketing Operations&lt;/a&gt; can localize websites, translation proxy is the fastest growing option.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sggottlieb/6883196269/" title="Translation Proxy Architecture by sggottlieb, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7036/6883196269_af000bce86.jpg" width="500" height="415" alt="Translation Proxy Architecture"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach has several benefits.  Among them:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;h3&gt;There is no need for the core publishing platform to have multi-lingual capabilities&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        &lt;p&gt;The publishing platform behind the primary language site may not support localization features such as storing different localized versions of a piece of content or being able to easily localize display templates.  Many CMS implementations start with a localization-capable product but then cut corners, which prohibits adding alternate languages down the road.  Building a site for localization takes planning, skill, and investment that cannot be justified if localization is less than a drop-dead requirement at the time of the initial implementation.  Retrofitting is a lot of work. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;h3&gt;You can translate both content and template text in one place&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        &lt;p&gt;In a typical translation scenario, we need to translate both the content (which the content contributors manage) and the presentation templates (code that the developers manage).  See this screenshot for an annotated view (sorry for the color palette choice.  I understand if you have a sudden craving for a Big Mac).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sggottlieb/6837888675/" title="Template vs. Content by sggottlieb, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7006/6837888675_18965fdf3c.jpg" width="500" height="337" alt="Template vs. Content"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;p&gt;With other localization approaches, you need to localize these aspects separately: the content through an editorial workflow and the template text through a software development life-cycle.  In the translation proxy approach, all of this text can be localized together. &lt;/p&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;h3&gt;You can leverage your main site’s interactive functionality.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        &lt;p&gt;Because requests are proxied back to your primary language site, all interactive features (including search, contact forms, and even commerce transactions) will continue to be supported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Your content stays secure.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        &lt;p&gt;Because the translation proxy only sees what regular visitors see, there is no risk to the security of the main site.  The one thing you want to watch out for is transactional functionality.  You want to make sure that the proxy service does not collect sensitive information that visitors submit to the website and also can create rules to ignore sensitive information coming back to the visitor.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        &lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like with any technology, translation proxies are not ideal for every case.  Here are some reasons why a translation proxy may not be right for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Local markets cannot create original content in the proxy.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        &lt;p&gt;A translation proxy only translates (or, in some cases filters) content from the main site.  There is no clean way to add original content to a localized site managed by a translation proxy.   This is perhaps the biggest show-stopper for some companies.  If you have a local marketing team that wants the autonomy to develop original content for their local markets, a translation proxy is not going to help.  They need to publish their content somewhere before it can be served through the proxy.  Perhaps they could create areas on the main site for their specific regions but then they wouldn't be leveraging the proxy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;h3&gt;A translation proxy will not allow you to neglect your localized sites.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        &lt;p&gt;If you want to save money by putting up simple, (crappy,) static sites for local markets, a translation proxy is not a great solution.  The translation proxy model is intended for managing localized versions of the primary site.    Any new or changed content will display in the primary language until it is translated.  You can contain translation costs by excluding certain sections from your localized websites (for example, you may not want to translate your blog or press releases).   Still, with the proxy model, you need to consider the translation costs when you add new content to your website.  One work-around could be to create a trimmed down, rarely-updated "international site" on your CMS and use the translation proxy to localize it for all your foreign markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Translation volumes are difficult to predict.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        &lt;p&gt;Unlike traditional translation projects, a translation proxy service is monitoring a constantly changing website so scope is going to be fluid.  This is not an “invest and then rest” type of service.  It requires a level of attention and planning commensurate with the level of work that is done on the main site.  If you are serious about reaching into new markets, this investment should seem reasonable to you.  It’s still cheaper than hiring in-country marketers to produce original content.  Look for suppliers that offer a capacity model where you pay a fixed fee based on expected usage.  This will protect you against a large per-word translation bill after your primary language authors have been particularly prolific.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the translation proxy approach is not optimal for every business or website, its benefits are very compelling for many.  A translation proxy may be worth considering if you learn that your sophisticated interactive website was not built with localization in mind and you want to serve new markets with the same level of experience that you serve your home market.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Dimensions of Success (or Ways to Fail)</title>
    <content type='html'>While most of my consulting work is in product selection, I think the most interesting and rewarding type of project is evaluating the results of a CMS implementation.  The typical scenario is that a client feels like their CMS project didn't yield the expected results and engages Content Here to identify what went wrong and what adjustments should be made.  Without this type of analysis, it is typical for a buyer to grumble and suffer with the solution for the next three or four years until they have the money to replace it; then the cycle repeats itself because nothing was learned from the experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When evaluating a CMS implementation, I typically look at three dimensions: expectations, product, and project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expectation rationality&lt;/strong&gt;.  Too many projects are doomed from the start because the &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2009/07/you-bought-a-web-page-factory-not-a-webmaster-android.html"&gt;expectations were set too high&lt;/a&gt;.  It is often useful to have a third party assess whether the project was oversold or if it under-delivered.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Platform suitability&lt;/strong&gt;.  Choosing the wrong CMS product also puts the project in jeopardy.  The platform should support your requirements, feel intuitive to your users, be maintainable by your team, and be supported by a well run company that can be a compatible partner.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Project execution&lt;/strong&gt;.  The project to implement the solution should be appropriately scoped and phased to achieve short term results quickly and work toward long term goals.  You need to select a competent integration partner (internal or external) that you can trust and collaborate with to make good decisions.  Your users need to be well supported with training and coaching.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Failure in any of these areas makes a buyer miserable but some are more correctable than others.  Choosing the wrong product is the hardest mistake to undo.  Migrations are always hard.  Even if you can get the data over, all the work to customize and configure the wrong solution is non-transferable.  However, it may be possible to minimize the impact through customizations and work-arounds.  Generally, these systems are flexible enough to achieve some level of comfort even if it is not ideal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Irrational expectations is the easiest problem to correct.  For example, if it was unreasonable to expect that everyone in the organization (without training) would autonomously contribute their own content, maybe you need to keep that web coordinator role.  Maybe some of the benefits will not be immediately realized after the first release of the solution.  It is fairly typical to do a few subsequent maintenance releases to expose new functionality or correct bad design assumptions.  Ideally, this should be a living solution that is constantly evolving and improving.  You are not going to get everything right the first time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Even though no implementations are perfect, some projects go better than others.  Inexperience is the biggest culprit.  You want to work with an integration team that is familiar with the technology (on most platforms, it usually takes 2 to 3 substantial projects to establish best practices and patterns).  You also want to work with a team that has done similar scale projects, understands your industry, and can speak your language.  It is easy to misinterpret requirements and make bad design assumptions if you don't have a suitable context.  Sometimes a rocky implementation with a new vendor is part of a natural learning process and things will improve.  Other times, it is a sign that two organizations are incompatible as partners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If your organization feels disillusioned by a recent CMS implementation, the good news is that most problems can be fixed without having to start over.  All that is needed is a solid understanding of what went wrong and a roadmap of corrections.  Over time, the solution will probably be able to achieve all of the reasonable expectations that you had for it. Let me know if you need help evaluating your CMS implementation.  Content Here can put you on a path to improving it.</content>

    <title>Open Source CMS Search Engine</title>
    <content type='html'>Specialized search engines that focus on a subset of the web are becoming increasingly popular.  These services can reduce problems with ambiguous terms (such as the word "pool" that could reference a parlor game, something that you swim in, a group of persistent connections to a database...) by focusing on a subset of the web.  Google is enabling this specialization through its &lt;a href="http://google.com/coop"&gt;Co-Op&lt;/a&gt; technology.  At least that is what Ric Shreves from &lt;a href="http://www.mambo-foundation.org/"&gt;Mambo&lt;/a&gt; specialist &lt;a href="http://waterandstone.com/"&gt;Water and Stone&lt;/a&gt; (they also work in &lt;a href="http://wordpress.org"&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://drupal.org"&gt;Drupal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://joomla.org"&gt;Joomla&lt;/a&gt;!) is using it for.  Water and Stone has recently launched &lt;a href="http://cms-search.waterandstone.com"&gt;CMS Search&lt;/a&gt;, which indexes around 75 open source CMS project sites. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This looks like an interesting tool.  There is a "refine" feature that limits search to a subset of sites.  Try using this to search for a feature and then drill down to see what the community or the documentation of a project has to say about that feature.   Unfortunately, this refining feature only works with projects that Water and Stone specializes in.</content>

    <title>The Content Here Map of the Information Market</title>
    <content type='html'>I generally dislike the "map of the market" approach to describing a software market because the actual use of software is too specific to be generalized into abstract dimensions like "high and low end" or "innovative." However, during a recent Content Here leadership offsite (OK, I went on a bike ride), I was thinking about Content Here's positioning in the marketplace and I found a picture to be quite helpful. This is what I came up with (click on the image for a larger view). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sggottlieb/6916256175/" title="Map of the Content Management Information Market by sggottlieb, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7052/6916256175_8fc36eb59f.jpg" width="500" height="343" alt="Map of the Content Management Information Market"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary point of the diagram is to show that consumers enter the information marketplace with different types of questions and information providers offer different types of answers. The intent of the question appears on a continuum that ranges from problem focused to solution focused. Technology buyers are focused on their business problems. As you progress towards the "problem" end of the spectrum, the questions get more specific and require intimate knowledge of the context and domain to answer. On the other end of the spectrum, the consumers (software vendors and investors) are trying to understand trends that will inform a business strategy for managing (or investing in) a solution. The information on the solution side gets very abstract and speculative because the solutions themselves are designed to be re-usable across many different kinds of problems and software companies need to build products that will be sold in the future. In the center of the spectrum is where the interests of the buyers and sellers converge. Here the buyers are thinking a little beyond the specific problems they are trying to solve today to where they need to be in five years. Here vendors are thinking beyond how their solution measures up today to what buyers need going forward.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All of these questions are important and the marketplace for answers has evolved to answer them. On the sellers side of the diagram, you have the major analyst firms who primarily serve the technology vendors. Their information can also useful to the CIO that is trying to understand trends but it will not be useful for a decision faced today. I didn't put too much thought into the positions of the "sell-side" analysts on the right side of the diagram. I would love input here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I am more interested in the left side of the diagram — in particular, where Content Here is focused. My unofficial tag line for Content Here is "Content Here helps technology buyers be awesome at making decisions" (format borrowed from the &lt;a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2009/11/01.html"&gt;Joel on Software article: "Figuring out what your company is all about"&lt;/a&gt;). Content Here tries to help client's answer the questions of what technology to buy and what do to with it. To play this role, I need a deep understanding of how the various technology products work — but not as deep as a systems integrator that specializes in that technology or the software vendor's technical support. Consequently, my &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/products-page"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; are very technical compared to other analyst reports. I tend not to go as broad as CMS Watch because I stop keeping up with a product once I realize it is not relevant to my potential client base. Only when I hear that something has changed with the product do I check back (and this is why I don't publish a list of technologies that I follow or don't follow). Most importantly, I need to be able to rapidly discover a client's requirements through an &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;efficient consultative process&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This hybrid approach puts Content Here in between a systems integrator and an analyst company in terms of detail. I am not surprised by low number of competitors because this is a hard place to be. I need to dig into the many technologies I cover by building prototypes and talking with implementors. I also need to understand the business aspects of how the technologies are used. I am always on the challenging slope of the learning curve. I can neither sit back and pontificate on the abstract nor enjoy the luxury of knowing every detail. As difficult as it is to be in this position, I can't think of a more stimulating business to be in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That is as far as I have thought things through. I would love to hear your feedback on the usefulness of the concept and the positioning of the different players. In particular, if you are a consumer of information, is the information marketplace serving you with the appropriate level of detail?</content>

    <title>Another Open Source Project Management Tool</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;A few months ago I was looking for a project planning tool (a la Microsoft Office) that would run on Linux.  I found &lt;a href="http://www.imendio.com/projects/planner/"&gt;Planner by Imendio&lt;/a&gt; and have been using it for a while now.  Here is what I think:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Positives&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The application is very simple to use and does not try to "outsmart" you like MS Project.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The actual project plan is stored in a very easy to read and simple XML format.  If you know a little bit about XSLT, you can do some cool things with the data.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can output the plan into an HTML document (the application uses XSLT to this) that you can distribute to people that don't have Planner.  The output looks great in the browser but does not print very well.  The Gantt section has a horizontal scroll that gets lopped off during print.  To correct the problem I just edited the XSL files to remove the Gantt chart section. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The application is very stable.  I have had no crashed or file corruptions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Because the data file is plain text XML, you can actually use a source code system to manage it, see the differences and actually understand what is going on.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Planner does not run on Microsoft Windows.  Gnome only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Planner is not Microsoft Project and, therefore, is usually not the company standard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Planner does not export into MS Project format.  Although, you could set up xsl transforms to output to other formats (I think MS Project imports CSV).  I doubt most project managers would be into tinkering with XSL.  Come to think of it, most project managers would not be running Linux on a 12 pound laptop with the horsepower of a server. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Planner only allows Finish to Start and Start to Start dependencies.  I am a big fan of Finish to Finish dependencies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;At first I thought the Lag feature did not work but then I noticed that it is done in hours.  Surprise! I didn't expect that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You need to open the properties window to edit most fields of a task (such as resources).  This can really slow down data entry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The "Work" column is deceptive for super-tasks.  It is really duration.  So if you have two concurrent sub-tasks or have multiple resources working on a sub-task, the work column of the super-tasks will not total the work of the sub-tasks.  This makes various time estimation exercises difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think Planner is a pretty useful tool with some limitations which may or not be deal breakers depending on your environment.  I am looking forward to checking out &lt;a href="http://www.openworkbench.org/"&gt;Open Workbench&lt;/a&gt;, an open source version of Niku Workbench which is part of Niku Enterprise Project Management Suite.  It's Windows only which will make it easier to adopt - especially when working with clients.</content>

    <content type='html'>Good stuff.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As you know, my EContent columns often point out it&amp;#39;s not the tools, but the people and processes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nevertheless, next Tuesday&amp;#39;s column will introduce a technology that may provide continuous fresh content to a CoP website page by repurposing otherwise inaccessible mailing list content to web content.&lt;br&gt;_______&lt;br&gt;--excerpts--&lt;br&gt;Sadly, it&amp;#39;s just not tools and techniques you need. You need people and processes, content flows and a content lifecycle.  If you have these things, then tools can facilitate the process, and most of the top tools will do a terrific job for you. But it&amp;#39;s not tools and techniques that create the content and its organization, make it usable, credible, and desirable, in short make it into valuable knowledge that is actually used.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I may send a draft of this article to the cmpros list to solicit comments.</content>

    <title>Results from Publishing Workflow Survey</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://www.thecontentwrangler.com/"&gt;The Content Wrangler&lt;/a&gt;  has a &lt;a href="http://www.thecontentwrangler.com/comments.php?id=P180_0_1_0"&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; some very interesting results from a survey on workflow.  Some of the findings:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bottlenecks continue to be a problem in workflow and many respondents feel that better automation would improve matters&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The process is often hampered by people waiting on dependencies and then being rushed to complete their tasks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Finding and distributing the right version of an asset continues to be a problem.  Particularly in environments that practice content reuse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;On an unrelated note, many respondents never heard of some of the major CMS vendors.  26% never heard of Documentum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</content>

    <title>This week in OS CMS</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;This post is an experiment on the concept of a weekly summary of development activity on an open source project.  One of the great things about open source software is the transparency.  All discussions happen out in the open on mail lists and forums so an enormous amount of knowledge is captured in an archivable format.  On the downside, following these lists takes an inordinate amount of time for someone with other priorities.  Therefore, I was thinking a human filtered and summarized digest would be something of value to users of an open source software product.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am trying to determine the appropriate level of detail.  The targeted audience is a manager of either software development or network operations - someone who does not have time to read the full list but wants a little more information than what one would get with announcements.  I would appreciate feedback as to whether this type of information is useful.  &lt;b&gt;Now, on with the show.....&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;This Week in Plone&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Release 2.1 is scheduled for May 2005.  It will run on Zope 2.x rather than the new Zope 3.x&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three developers (Philip Auersperg, Jadok Batlogg, and Jens Klein) have started an initiative to enhance Plone's content editing forms by adding some client side scripting to perform functions like validation and multiple object editing without reloading the page.  This is in response to &lt;a href="http://members.plone.org/development/plips/53"&gt;PLIP 53&lt;/a&gt;.  The team has a &lt;a href="http://members.plone.org/Members/batlogg/concepts/zuccaro/daidalos_edit"&gt;mockup&lt;/a&gt; available for review.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;This Week in Lenya&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new feature which enables XMLHTTP was submitted by Josias Theony and checked into the trunk on February 9th.  For those who do not know, XMLHTTP allows a page to call back to the server to get more data without an entire page reload.  Probably the most famous example of XMLHTTP in action is &lt;a href="http://labs.google.com/"&gt;Google Labs'&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/webhp?complete=1&amp;hl=en"&gt; Google Suggests&lt;/a&gt;.  Try typing in the search box and watch common search terms start appearing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An enhancement to make the menuing system cleaner and more flexible has been added to the trunk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been a few updates to improve the installation guide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On February 8, a massive patch (1.2 MB) was applied to the trunk.  This was the result of code cleanup effort by Gregor Rothfuss.  The update adds missing javadocs, fixes some resource leaks, and makes exception handling more explicit.  Now the Eclipse Find Bugs plugin is more useful on the Lenya code base.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Version 1.4 of Lenya will introduce a replacement to Lenya Usescases (sequences of pages)  called UsecaseFramework which uses Cocoon Flow.  There is some updated information on the &lt;a href="http://wiki.apache.org/lenya/LenyaUsecases"&gt;Wiki&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>New Optaros White Paper: The Growth of Open Source Software in
Organizations</title>
    <content type='html'>Optaros just released a new white paper that looks at how companies are using open source software.  The study is based on a survey of 512 U.S. companies and government organizations.   The report observes that companies are starting to use open source for more than infrastructure and browsers.  42% of respondents said they were using open source portals and/or content management systems somewhere within their organization.  16% were using open source in customer relationship management.   Read the press release &lt;a href="http://www.optaros.com/np/company_news_12-19-05.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; or the whole report &lt;a href="http://www.optaros.com/publications_wpapers.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.</content>

    <title>Content Convergence and Integration</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I was just looking through the program for the &lt;a href="http://convergence.confabb.com/conferences/cci2008"&gt;Content Convergence and Integration conference&lt;/a&gt; that is being held in Vancouver March 12th - 14th and I wish that I could be there. Not only is Vancouver a great city to visit, the sessions look very good. There are a number of talks on content re-use in a Web 2.0 world sound particularly interesting. If you are able to break away, I would seriously consider going.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content>

    <title>Nuxeo Web Engine</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://www.nuxeo.com/"&gt;Nuxeo&lt;/a&gt; just &lt;a href="http://blogs.nuxeo.com/sections/blogs/fermigier/2008_07_11_first-release-nuxeo-webengine"&gt;announced the first official release of their WebEngine&lt;/a&gt;.  I have been hearing updates about this project for a while and have been meaning to check it out.  From glancing through the slides, WebEngine seems very similar to &lt;a href="http://incubator.apache.org/sling/site/index.html"&gt;Apache Sling&lt;/a&gt; and has many of the things that I like about Sling: a RESTful interface and a lightweight, content-centric programming model. In WebEngine templates are written in FreeMarker and you can script in your choice of Groovy, Python, Ruby, Javascript and other languages (thanks to &lt;a href="http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/J2SE/Desktop/scripting/"&gt;JSR 223&lt;/a&gt;) which provides a scripting interface for Java applications).  I am looking forward to playing around with WebEngine.  In my past experiences with Nuxeo applications, I found them to be well engineered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are new to Nuxeo, they have a legitimate claim to being the first open source ECM company.   Their primary geographic focus is in France and they are less well known in the US.  Nuxeo's original ECM product (which combined Document Management, Collaboration, and Web Content Management) was written on the Zope platform.  In 2006, they ported their product (then called CPS for Collaborative Portal Server) to a Java stack (&lt;a href="http://www.slideshare.net/sfermigier/nuxeo-ep-5-a-seam-case-study/"&gt;using JBoss Seam&lt;/a&gt;).  Long time readers of this blog may remember &lt;a href="http://blog.contenthere.net/2006/09/nuxeo-cps-switching-to-java.html"&gt;me being skeptical of whether they could pull it off&lt;/a&gt;.  It turns out that they did a great job with the migration and have been aggressively pushing the platform forward. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like, &lt;a href="http://www.alfresco.com"&gt;Alfresco&lt;/a&gt;, Nuxeo's experience and customer base leans towards the document management side of ECM.  Web content management is a newer focus that is (I think) well timed as more companies are looking for ways to rapidly build internally and externally facing content centric web applications.</content>

    <title>The Case of the Mysterious Redirect</title>
    <content type='html'>Like most technical people, I have many development environments running on my local workstation.  I use a configuration of Apache virtual hosts and my /etc/hosts file to keep them sorted out.  It normally works great but yesterday I solved a vexing issue and  I thought I would share.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The issue was that whenever I hit a specific development environment, it would redirect me to my blog (&lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net"&gt;http://www.contenthere.net&lt;/a&gt;) with a path that was based on the location of the Apache doc root.  I hadn't used this environment in a while and so a lot of things could have caused the problem.  At first I thought it was a DNS issue.  Then I was certain it was an Apache configuration issue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After trying all sorts of things, I realized that I had accidentally saved some .htaccess file to the root of my home directory.  The doc root of this particular development environment (which was inside my home directory) didn't have its own .htaccess so Apache traversed up the directory structure to find one and applied the rewrite rules within it.  Deleting this file made the problem go away.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I suspect that I accidentally copied the errant .htaccess file from a server by double-clicking on it in my FTP client.  I had no idea that Apache would behave in that way.  I spent ages searching through Apache configurations and the doc root.  I looked into issues that might have been caused when I upgraded to Mountain Lion.  But I didn't look in the root of my home directory until I searched for all of the .htaccess files on my machine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One thing that I learned from troubleshooting (in addition to .htaccess behavior) was about &lt;a href="http://blog.philippklaus.de/2012/02/install-dnsmasq-locally-on-mac-os-x-via-homebrew/"&gt;DNSMasq&lt;/a&gt;.  It allows you to create wildcard entries like .dev, which saves a lot of effort editing the /etc/hosts file.  Pretty cool!  So it wasn't a total loss of time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hopefully someone will learn from my experience.</content>

    <content type='html'>It is absolutely about discovery.  But my point is that, because web content is published, one has to assume there is a copy out there (be it a print out, a cached search result, or the way back machine).  Even worse, what if the copy is not a copy but a forgery?  Wouldn&amp;#39;t it be better to be able to refute the forgery with the actual version?  Also, because web content has been published (and passed internal legal review, etc.), it is less likely to contain unscrupulous information than a private email or small circulation memo.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don&amp;#39;t really buy the cost argument in web content management discovery. Any decent web content management system stores semi-structured content in a repository that is both searchable and shows versions of assets.  The cost of discovery is more of an issue when there are thousands of documents (some native digital, some scanned digital, some paper) that expensive lawyers need to manually slog through.  This doesn&amp;#39;t happen in WCM.</content>

    <title>Open formats in personal knowledge management</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I have a complicated relationship with personal information management (PIM) tools.  I love PIM software and services that promise to remember everything that I once knew.  I am tempted by every new information gadget that comes down the pike.  But I have also been burned lots of times too.  I spent hours on corporate intranets documenting my knowledge only to have them shut down.  I used proprietary software like the &lt;a href="http://www.thebrain.com/"&gt;The Brain&lt;/a&gt; which became inaccessible when I switched computing platforms (note: now The Brain supports Linux and Mac OSX as well as Windows).  My Google notebooks are now barely supported by Google.  And now we have news of Delicious's uncertain future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of these experiences, I have been fighting my urges to use services like &lt;a href="http://www.evernote.com/"&gt;Evernote&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://springpadit.com/home/"&gt;SpringPad&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/yojimbo/"&gt;Yojimbo&lt;/a&gt;, etc..  Instead, I have been sticking with humble text files.  In an earlier post, I described how I am using &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2010/03/my-enterprise-text-editor.html"&gt;TextMate as a blogging tool&lt;/a&gt;.  I have started to use it as a knowledge management tool as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sggottlieb/5366403813/" title="Textmate Notebook by sggottlieb, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5167/5366403813_c47c8ff361.jpg" width="500" height="390" alt="Textmate Notebook" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don't pretend that I have the features that products like Evernote do, but here is what I can do:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Create notebooks with multiple pages by using TextMate's project feature.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Organize pages into folders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Create todo items and other tags that I can summarize by using the ToDo bundle&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Search using "Find in Project" or Spotlight.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Collaborate with others using GitHub or another code hosting service.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Store and organize binary files like diagrams created in OmniGraffle.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The truth for me is that the greatest benefit of any PIM tool is simply the act of recording and organizing the information.  These activities help me remember and process information into actionable knowledge in my head.  You can do that with any tool.  The second most important aspect is search and recall.  This is where the open format of text files really excels.  It would be really frustrating to try to retrieve some information but not have access to the software to consume it. &lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>The Three Qualities of Effective Publishing: Findable, Usable, and
Actionable</title>
    <content type='html'>When the creative process of content generation is complete, there is a tendency to breath a sigh of relief and relax. In reality, however, some of the most important work still lies ahead. To have impact, content needs to be amplified by effective publishing processes just like a musician needs amplifiers and acoustics to fill a stadium with sound. When publishing anything, I ask these three questions. Is it findable? Is it usable? Is it actionable? Let's dissect them one at a time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Is it Findable?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If your content is not found, it may as well not even exist. In order to be findable, a piece of content should be unique. It needs to answer a question or solve a problem that hasn't been solved before. Or be an innovative approach to something that people struggle with. Otherwise your content is just going to get lost in the fray. If you have redundant assets on your site, it is time to de-clutter. If are creating content that already exists in other places on the web, divert your energy to doing something original.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second part of fundability is that it needs to promoted and linked from where desirable audiences are likely to be. This means promotion on relevant landing pages and navigation, social networks, user groups, etc. It also needs to be worded in terms that people are likely to search for. Findable content is content that appears where people are looking. Metadata like title and description are critical in ensuring that the content stands out on search results and other lists of content.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Is it Usable?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now that your consumer has found your content, you want his/her experience to be a positive one. You number one concern is that it displays properly on the device the visitor is using. You shouldn't throw up dialogs that are difficult to dismiss on a tiny display. You shouldn't force someone to download an app just to read an article. If your content is paginated, make sure the paging links work properly. No matter how useful the information, an awkward user experience will leave a lasting impression of frustration and you don't want your brand to be associated with frustration. If you don't have the budget to test all of your content on all browsers and platforms, go for simplicity. This will reduce the likelihood that the presentation will stand in the way of the information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Personally, I think content that requires filling out a lead capture form is not usable. I don't want to subject myself to being a sales target before I even know the content is any good. Judging from the information that people enter into lead forms, a lot of other people feel this way too. Marten Rapavy has written an excellent article called &lt;a href="http://www.cmswire.com/cms/customer-experience/content-marketing-5-tips-how-not-to-kill-your-leads-016682.php"&gt;Content Marketing: 5 Tips How Not to Kill Your Leads&lt;/a&gt;. He advocates optional contact forms and calls to action in the content.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Is it Actionable?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hooray! Your content has been found and enjoyed by a visitor. You have made a positive impression but that attention will not last for long. You have milliseconds to convert this positive experience into an action that benefits your business. You hope for at least one of two things. Ideally, you want the customer to engage directly with you and become a sales opportunity. This visitor understands the value that you offer and has qualified himself as a real potential customer. The opportunity is well along the sales pipeline, you just need to close the deal. Make sure you have an easy call to action like a simple form asking to be contacted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The other outcome, which is nearly as positive, is that the visitor likes your content so much he/she wants to share it with his/her network. This could lead to brand visibility and many sales opportunities. To make sharing easy, make sure there is a direct URL to a page where friends can access the content. Complex, compound pages (like a portal or an application) can make this complicated. Don't make the &lt;a title="ASP.Net and the Confusion of GET and POST" href="http://gadgetopia.com/post/6119"&gt;Applebees mistake&lt;/a&gt;.  A share link builder is useful here. This link better not require a registration form or login. People don't want to send their network into the jaws of a sales pipeline. Protected content does not go viral. Protected content just sits there safely unread.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To prove that your content drove action, make sure that it is properly instrumented. This means that configuring analytics software and tracking links to see how the content drives behavior such as filling out a contact form or driving other visitors to the site. If your content is not instrumented, you will never know what impact it had and whether it was worth producing and publishing it. You will also never be able to improve your performance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most companies undervalue the role of publishing both on external and internal websites. &lt;a href="http://www.contenthere.net/2010/02/the-myth-of-the-occasional-cms-user.html"&gt;There is this myth that, with the right content management system, publishing is as easy as "saving" content&lt;/a&gt;. Yes, adding the content and making it available should be easy and usually are — just like what you saw in the software demo. But that is just the first step in publishing. The rest takes skill, commitment, and time.</content>

    <title>Gartner acknowledges open source before Bush accepts global warming</title>
    <content type='html'>... only just.  Or maybe it's a tie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cnet.com/8301-13505_1-9919052-16.html"&gt;Matt Asay reports&lt;/a&gt; on a &lt;a href="http://www.computerworlduk.com/toolbox/open-source/open-source-business/news/index.cfm?newsid=8532"&gt;Gartner prediction that 90% of SaaS vendors will use open source components in their products&lt;/a&gt;.  I find it hard to believe that most SaaS vendors are not already running Linux, MySQL, or some open source programming language/framework/component. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content>

    <title>Why do intranets stink and what can be done about it?</title>
    <content type='html'>Bryant and I just posted the latest &lt;a href="http://themalcontents.blogspot.com/2007/03/episode-7-intranets.html"&gt;installment&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="http://themalcontents.blogspot.com/"&gt;The Malcontents&lt;/a&gt;.  This week we hosted &lt;a href="http:///"&gt;Toby Ward&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="http://www.prescientdigital.com/"&gt;Prescient Digital&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.steptwo.com.au/columntwo/index.html"&gt;James Robertson&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="http://www.steptwo.com.au/"&gt;Step Two Designs&lt;/a&gt; to talk about the promise, successes and disappointments of corporate intranets and what can be done to improve matters.  In addition to crossing many time zones (GMT-8, GMT-5, GMT+11) we covered a lot of ground:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The value that a good intranet can bring&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The current average grade of an intranet&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The amount of interest that companies have in improving their intranet&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tools and how best to use them&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why companies fail in their intranet initiatives&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Will the much awaited &lt;a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepointserver/FX100492001033.aspx"&gt;MOSS 2007&lt;/a&gt; solve all that?  You will have to listen and find out!</content>

    <title>An Evening with Joomla&amp;#39;s Mitch Pirtle</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Last night &lt;a href="http://www.bostonphp.org"&gt;BostonPHP&lt;/a&gt; hosted an evening with  Mitch Pirtle of &lt;a href="http://www.joomla.org/"&gt;Joomla!&lt;/a&gt; fame at our &lt;a href="http://www.optaros.com"&gt;our Boston office&lt;/a&gt;. Mitch is a great speaker and his passion for Joomla! and open source really came through in his presentation. While most of the talk turned into an introduction to Mambo, Mitch did weave in some good background about Joomla!'s break from Mambo and where Joomla! is going. He promises to come back to get more into details about technology behind Joomla!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, some details about the split. Mitch related his experience of sitting in a conference booth representing Mambo and then seeing an &lt;a href="http://forum.mamboserver.com/showthread.php?t=56587"&gt;open letter&lt;/a&gt; announcing Miro's formation of the Mambo foundation without involving the core development team.  Just at that moment, he saw &lt;a href="http://emoglen.law.columbia.edu/"&gt;Eben Moglen&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href="http://www.softwarefreedom.org/"&gt;Software Freedom Law Center&lt;/a&gt; coming up the escalator. Eben and the SFLC were critical in guiding the Joomla team through a process littered with potential land mines. Joomla! also received support from &lt;a href="http://www.vasoftware.com/"&gt;VA Software&lt;/a&gt; who donated hardware, software (&lt;a href="http://www.vasoftware.com/sourceforge/index.php"&gt;SourceForge Enterprise Edition&lt;/a&gt;) and hosting services for the new &lt;a href="http://developer.joomla.org"&gt;Joomla Forge&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;a href="http://www.rochenhost.com/"&gt;Rochen&lt;/a&gt; donated hosting for www.joomla.org and, before long, Joomla! and &lt;a href="http://www.opensourcematters.org"&gt;Open Source Matters&lt;/a&gt;, the holding organization for Joomla!, came were born.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Mitch, nearly all of the core development team and much of the community, as well as many third party component developers have shifted over to the Joomla! side. Today the Joomla! project is thriving. The forums already have over 160,000 posts and are growing at a 1,100 per day pace. There are already 11,000 registered developers and 700 projects on Joomla Forge (just like the big &lt;a href="http://www.sf.net"&gt;SourceForge&lt;/a&gt;, many have not been started yet). One interesting project that is going on is to put a Joomla! front end on SourceForge using the new Web Services API. VA is helping with the initiative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.packtpub.com/"&gt;Packt publishing&lt;/a&gt;, who sells &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1904811736/qid=1136410461/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-8625054-6739149?n=507846&amp;s=books&amp;amp;v=glance"&gt;Building Websites With Mambo&lt;/a&gt;, is planning on publishing a similar Joomla! book. I have not recently talked to the Mambo team, which has reloaded their core team with new developers, but it does seem like Joomla! has the momentum of the two projects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mitch talked a little about the new 1.1 release (due out soon). The key advancement of 1.1 will be full UTF-8 support. This feature trumped a bunch of other items on the roadmap because of the urgent need for supporting an extended character set. While the team was working in the core, they couldn't resist doing some deep refactoring and modernization of the code. Thanks to better code design, the new version of Joomla! is expected to be faster. Joomla! 1.1 also introduces the first steps of a database abstraction layer which will make it easier to run Joomla! on databases other than MySQL (Postgres will be supported soon with commercial databases like Oracle and SQLServer soon after). Templates will use the templating engine &lt;a href="http://www.php-tools.net/site.php?file=patTemplate/overview.xml"&gt;patTemplate&lt;/a&gt; rather than simple PHP.  Great, another tagging syntax to learn!  1.1 also brings a more sophisticated error handler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People hoping for user facing features like fine grained security, workflow, and versioning will have to wait for version 1.2 which looks like it is going to be huge. Interestingly, a lot of this code has already been written but Joomla! is being conservative about how much new stuff to release at a time to reduce the pain of upgrades.  Support for PHP 5 will have to wait for Joomla! 2.0, a total rewrite which will probably be based on the &lt;a href="http://www.zend.com/news/zendpr.php?id=109"&gt;Zend Framework&lt;/a&gt; to which Mitch's company &lt;a href="http://www.jamboworks.com/"&gt;JamboWorks&lt;/a&gt; is contributing a security module.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I asked if separating from Mambo gave the project more freedom to extend and modernize the application and Mitch did say that backwards compatibility with earlier versions of Mambo was a constraint that they are happy to be released of. I don't know if the team would have done the level of refactoring that they did if they were worried about a migration path. Also, I am sure that the feeling created by starting something new energized the team.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the talk, there were some references to some useful Joomla! resources:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://api.joomla.org"&gt;The API site&lt;/a&gt; was unveiled.  This site uses the PHP library tool &lt;a href="http://www.phpdoc.org/"&gt;phpDocumentor&lt;/a&gt; to automatically generate documentation based on comments (like Javadoc). The comments are a little thin right now but now that the API site is up, there will be more incentive to write good comments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.jamboworks.com/Join_the_JamboWorks_Template_Club/"&gt;JamboWorks Template Club&lt;/a&gt; is a membership based service which gives access to a collection of pre-made templates. There are currently 12 templates on the site and a new template will be added every month. There were some great examples in the demo. $75 per year gives you access to the whole collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Boston PHP has just published a release candidate of &lt;a href="http://www.joscommerce.com/"&gt;josCommerce&lt;/a&gt; which ports the popular &lt;a href="http://mamboforge.net/projects/moscommerce/"&gt;mosCommerce&lt;/a&gt; eCommerce component to Joomla.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>
